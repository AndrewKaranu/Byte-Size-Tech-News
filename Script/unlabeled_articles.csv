There's no need to even type requests to it, thanks to the inclusion of Advanced Voice Mode on the desktop app now. You can just speak aloud, and ChatGPT will fulfill your requests even when you're doing other things. Instead of switching between tabs or opening a browser, you can call ChatGPT whenever needed to draft an email, brainstorm ideas, or fix some code. Speaking of coding, the new “Working with Apps” feature has ChatGPT running around many apps on your computer, especially for coding. You can give it access to apps on your Mac, and it’ll peek inside, understand what’s going on, and lend a helping hand. Say you’re using a code editor like Warp and staring at a long, confusing list of code. Instead of scrolling endlessly, you can ask ChatGPT to analyze what’s on the screen and it will offer suggestions, explanations, or even write new code snippets.OpenAIshowcased how by asking ChatGPT to write some code directly into Xcode,Apple’s app development tool. The apps ChatGPT works with aren't limited to coding services either. The AI assistant will write in English and programming languages right into apps like Apple Notes, Quip, and Notion. If you’re planning a trip and using Notion to jot down ideas, you can ask ChatGPT to help flesh them out, including citing sources from the internet. If you're a Mac user, the new features are all available. For Windows users, an update to the existing app is coming soon, though OpenAI hasn’t given a specific timeframe. These aren't the dramatic announcements of some of the previous days, but it's showcasing OpenAI's vision of ChatGPT spreading beyond the chat window. The AI could become a much more active collaborator, capable of blending multiple apps' powers into one convenient package. This is what OpenAI calls the “agentic” approach to AI, where ChatGPT performs tasks on your behalf, taking some of the workload off your shoulders. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. One day to go, let's see if OpenAI can close out with as much excitement as they began. It has to be better than the last verse of the song. Nobody wants to take 12 drummer drumming home, but a brand new AI model might be a nice stocking stuffer.",OpenAI releases Mac desktop ChatGPT features.,TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/chatgpts-mac-app-gets-a-glowup-with-new-coding-and-notetaking-features,

5,"Microsoft Teams and AnyDesk abused to deploy dangerous malware, so be on your guard","Cybercriminals are combiningMicrosoftTeams and AnyDesk to try and install a dangerous piece ofmalwareon their target’s devices, experts have warned. A report from Trend Micro, which claims to have recently observed one such attack in the wild, notes how the attackers would first send thousands of spam emails to their targets, and then reach out via Microsoft Teams, impersonating an employee of an external supplier. Offering help with the problem, the attackers would instruct the victim to install a Microsoft Remote Support application. If that failed, they would try the same with AnyDesk. If successful, the attackers would use the access to deliver multiple payloads, including a piece of malware called DarkGate. DarkGate is a highly versatile malware that can act as a backdoor on infected systems, allowing attackers to execute commands remotely. It can install additional payloads, and exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected. Data of high value includes login credentials, personally identifiable information, or data on clients, customers, and business partners. One of its notable features is its modular design, allowing attackers to modify the malware’s functionality. So, in one scenario it can act as an infostealer, and in another, as a dropper. The attack was blocked before doing any meaningful damage, but the researchers used it as an opportunity to warn businesses of the constant threat that lurks on the internet. Organizations need to train their employees to spot phishing and social engineering attacks, deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, and put as much of their infrastructure behind a VPN as possible. Furthermore, they should keep both software and hardware up to date, and keep in mind end-of-life dates for critical equipment.

6,"Fake DocuSign and HubSpot phishing emails target 20,000 Microsoft Azure accounts","Hackers of potentially Russian or Ukrainian origin have been targeting UK and EU organizations in the automotive, chemical, and industrial compound manufacturing industries with advanced phishing threats, experts have warned. A report from Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks’ cybersecurityarm, claims to have observed a campaign that started in June 2024, and was still active as of September. The goal of the campaign was to grab people’sMicrosoftAzure cloud accounts, and steal any sensitive information found there. The crooks would either send a Docusign-enabled PDF file, or an embedded HTML link, which would redirect the victims to a HubSpot Free Form Builder link. That link would usually invite the reader to “View Document on Microsoft Secured Cloud,” where the victims would be asked to provide their Microsoft Azure login credentials. The majority of the victims are located in Europe (mostly Germany), and the UK. Roughly 20,000 users were “successfully targeted”, the researchers said, adding that at least in a few cases, the victims provided the attackers with login credentials: ""We verified that the phishing campaign did make several attempts to connect to the victims' Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure,"" the researchers said in their writeup. Besides using custom phishing lures, with organization-specific branding and email formats, the crooks also went for targeted redirections using URLs designed to look like the victim organization’s domain. Furthermore, the miscreants used bulletproofVPS hosts, and reused their phishing infrastructure for multiple operations. Most of the phishing pages were hosted on .buzz domains. At press time, most of the attack infrastructure was pulled offline - Unit 42 said it worked together with HubSpot to address the abuse of the platform, and engaged with compromised organizations to provide recovery resources. Since most phishing servers are now offline, the researchers said the disruption efforts were effective.

7,Got an Intel Core Ultra 200S CPU? These are the patches you need to help gaming performance – with one more update coming in January 2025,"Intelhas finished its deep-dive investigation into problems with its Core Ultra 200S processors, and has presented the full results – with most of the issues now fixed, and one remaining remedy to be taken in January 2025. As you may recall, theseArrow Lake desktop CPUs, launched in October, disappointed with their initial performance – particularly forPC games– and Intel subsequently admitted that Core Ultra 200S CPUs weren’t performing as well as expected, but that fixes were in the pipeline. We were promised cures for a “series of multifactor issues” in fact, and now we have the full lowdown on those gremlins in the silicon works. In a lengthy blog post, coined a ‘field update’ (part one of two), Intel observed that: “Editorial conclusions on gaming performance were more polarized, with noteworthy statistical variation from one article to the next. These results were inconsistent with our internal testing.” Team Blue then says “we have determined that there are five distinct topics that could alter performance or functionality,” before going on to list those areas. They are as follows: All of these issues have been ‘root caused’ – meaning Intel has got to the bottom of why they’re happening – and the first four have been resolved by updates that are already out there. To get the benefit of these solutions, you need to avail yourself of two main updates. Firstly, updateWindows 11to build 26100.2314 (or newer), which is the November cumulative update for the 24H2 version. (We presume that the 23H2 update for the same month will also work – but Team Blue doesn’t mention this, so that isn’t clear). This will deal with issues number one and two as listed above. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Secondly, you need to get the latest BIOS update for your motherboard, which cures problem number four. As for issue three, that’s resolved by an Easy Anti-Cheat driver update (that’ll be piped through with the game that uses this anti-cheat system, which has been problematic with Arrow Lake on Windows 11 24H2). The final problem, number five, is the one that’ll be fixed in January 2025 with a new BIOS update, which will provide a further performance uptick. As Intel notes, you might just want to wait until next month anyway, then do your BIOS update and grab the fixes for issues four and five in one fell swoop. Whereas the exact gaming (and app) performance increase you get will depend on your exact mix of PC components and system configuration – as ever – it seems to be the case that the first BIOS update (for problem four) is going to give you at least a boost of a few percent, or perhaps a double-digit uplift (up to 14% in theory, a pretty wide range). The second patch (for problem five, coming in January) is likely to provide a “modest performance improvement in the single-digit range,” we’re told. So, both of these BIOS updates will likely provide a similar uplift of around 5% or so, maybe a bit more, but if you get lucky – or unlucky depending on how you look at it – you’ll get an even bigger boost (because your system was more hamstrung by these issues in the first place). We should also point out that fix number two is forIntel APO (Application Performance Optimization) tech, so only a small number of games will benefit from that (those that support APO). Intel has been commendably transparent in this process, and in revealing the detailed results of its investigation – as the company promised it would. So, that’s a definite tick for Team Blue, and hopefully any Arrow Lake gaming sluggishness will be pretty much ironed out by the time we get to the end of January 2025.

8,Apple set to build a server chip to service its own AI and may have sacrificed the company's fastest ever chip to achieve this; report suggests a strategic tie-in with $850bn Broadcom,"Appleis reportedly developing its first server chip tailored specifically for artificial intelligence. A paywalled report by Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu inThe Informationclaims the project, codenamed “Baltra,” aims to address the growing computational demands of AI-driven features and is expected to enter mass production by 2026. Apple’s silicon design team in Israel, which was responsible for designing the processors that replacedIntelchips in Macs in 2020, is now leading the development of the AI processor, according to sources. To support this effort, Apple has reportedly canceled the development of a high-performance Mac chip made up of four smaller chips stitched together. The report notes this decision, made over the summer, is intended to free up engineers in Israel to focus on Baltra, signaling Apple’s shift in priorities toward AI hardware. Apple is working with semiconductor giant Broadcom on this project, using the company’s advanced networking technologies needed for AI processing. While Apple usually designs its chips in-house, Broadcom’s role is expected to focus on networking solutions, marking a new direction in their partnership. To make the AI chip,The Informationsays Apple plans to use TSMC’s advanced N3P process, an upgrade from the technology behind its latest processors, like the M4. This move highlights Apple’s focus on enhancing performance and efficiency in its chip designs. The Baltra chip is expected to drive Apple’s efforts to integrate AI more deeply into its ecosystem. By leveraging Broadcom’s networking expertise and TSMC's advanced manufacturing techniques, Apple appears determined to catch up to rivals in the AI space and establish a stronger presence in the industry.

9,Government employees are still using Kaspersky despite the ban,"Kaspersky was banned in the US in September this year, but that hasn’t stopped workers from multiple government agencies from continuing to use Kaspersky products. New research from Bitsight has revealed that the Russia-basedantivirusfirm still has a surprising number of customers within the US government. It's been nearly 3 months sinceKaspersky products were banned from use in the USafter national security concerns rose surrounding the Russian firm, despite consistent denials of any Kremlin influence from the organisation. However, research shows that 40% of government agencies are still using Kaspersky products. In fact, so many users are still active that the US remains the firm’s largest customer, with 19 government agencies actively using the software. Kaspersky is no longer allowed to sell or update its antivirus software in the US, but this has only led to a 58% decline in the use of the products. Elsewhere, in countries like the UK, Italy, and Germany, warnings have been issued against the products, but no outright bans have been put in place. Despite this, Germany has seen a 69% decline in usage, so this has been arguably more effective. Many Kaspersky customers had theirantivirus products forcibly replacedwith partner software UltraAV, meaning there has been a significant global decline in the use of the firm's software since the ban. This isn’t the first timeKaspersky software has been found in use after the bantook effect, with some users reporting that they weren’t concerned about data theft and were unwilling to blindly trust the US government on this issue, with others simply unwilling to waste the money they had already spent. If the trend continues, it looks likely that Kaspersky products will be virtually out of use in the future, but it may take a few months.

11,Salt Typhoon: US cybersecurity watchdog urges switch to Signal-like messaging apps,"The US cybersecurity watchdog is urging citizens to use only secure end-to-end encryptedmessaging appslike Signal to secure mobile communications. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) shared a series of best practices on Wednesday, December 18, 2024, in the wake of the Salt Typhoon attack. This ""unprecedented cyberattack"" is thought to be the biggest intelligence compromise in US history, hacking at least eight US telecom companies to spy on citizens. While the latest CISA announcement is aimed at highly targeted individuals who possess information of interest to Chinese hackers, everyone can benefit from these security tips. These tips include avoiding unsecuredvirtual private network (VPN)apps. ""Highly targeted individuals should assume that all communications between mobile devices – including government and personal devices –and internet services are at risk of interception or manipulation,"" wrote the US cybersecurity watchdog. With this in mind, the experts urge switching toSignal-like communications apps. These services encrypt all the data in transit to ensure your messages remain private between the sender and the receiver (end to end). CISA recommends finding a service compatible with both Android and iPhone, allowing text message interoperability across platforms. These may also include features like disappearing messages and images, which can enhance privacy even further. Most importantly, ""When selecting an end-to-end encrypted messaging app, evaluate the extent to which the app and associated services collect and store metadata,"" said CISA. Metadatarefers to all the information that is not the content, such as IP address, timestamps, data file size, and more. Metadata collection, for instance, is one of the reasons why the likes of Signal or Session are considered more securethan WhatsApp. ⚠️ #CyberEspionage activity by PRC-affiliated threat actors is targeting #telecom infrastructure, compromising mobile communications for high-value individuals. Act now: Apply recommendations to protect your info from interception or manipulation. 👉 https://t.co/dtmWL9F82I pic.twitter.com/rOLakd58agDecember 18, 2024 CISA also suggests enabling phishing-resistant forms of two-factor authentication to ensure hackers cannot bypass this extra layer of protection. Experts recommend enabling Fast Identity Online (FIDO), which includes biometrics (like fingerprints or facial recognition) and physical security keys. As a rule of thumb, you should avoid using SMS as a second factor for authentication as these aren't phishing-resistant. ""SMS messages are not encrypted – a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them,"" explain the experts. US citizens are also urged to use strongpassword managertools to store all login details and find strong combinations. The likes of LastPass, Apple Passwords App, and Google Password ManagerProton Passare all free to use and automatically alert on weak, reused, or leaked passwords. Experts also recommend regularly updating devices' operating system software to patch any vulnerabilities. They also advise against the use of unsecured commercial VPN services as ""many free and commercial VPN providers have questionable security and privacy policies."" This is why it's important to choose thebest VPNapps with a reputable reputation, strict no-log policy, and strong security features – even better when independently audited. At the time of writing, TechRadar's top premium recommendation isNordVPN, whilePrivado VPNandProton VPNare the most securefree VPNs.",...,TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/salt-typhoon-us-cybersecurity-watchdog-urges-switch-to-signal-like-messaging-apps,

13,Midnight Blizzard hacking group hijacks RDP proxies to launch malware attacks,"AN advanced persistent threat, known as MidnightBlizzard, HAS launched a large-scale spear phishing attack that targeted governments, military organizations, and academic researchers in the West. The group exploited red team methodologies and anonymization tools, as it exfiltrated sensitive data from their target’s IT infrastructure, cybersecurity researchers from Trend Micro has revealed. In a report, the researchers said the group utilized a rogueRemote Desktop Protocol(RDP) and a Python-based tool called PyRDP. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email carrying a malicious RDP configuration file. If the victim runs it, it connects to an attacker-controlled RDP server. The campaign used 34 rogue RDP backend servers in combination with 193 proxy servers to redirect victim connections and mask the attackers' activities. Once the victim is connected, the crooks use PyRDP to intercept the connection, acting as a man-in-the-middle (MitM). Then, with access to target endpoints, the attackers could browse files, exfiltrate sensitive data, and more. While the total number of victims across the entire campaign is unclear, Trend Micro says that approximately 200 high-profile victims were targeted in a single day, when the campaign was at its peak, in late October 2024. The victims were government and military organizations, think tanks and academic researchers, entities related to the Ukrainian government, a cloud service provider, and entities associated with the Netherlands’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

14,Gamers beware: Windows 11 24H2 update could wreck your colors and crash your games,"Windows 11’s 24H2 updatehas another bug that’s affecting PC gamers, and others besides, with the glitch causing colors to be displayed incorrectly. Microsofthas confirmed the problem in its release health statusdashboard, informing us that the bug is happening to those who’ve enabled theAuto HDRfeature. Windows Latestreports that issues with the 24H2 update aren’t just affecting games but also colors in general on the desktop, which may be rendered wrongly until you go to the Settings app inWindows 11and switch off the ‘Automatically manage color for apps’ option. Microsoft doesn’t mention bugs pertaining to anything outside of PC games when using AutoHDR, though. Auto HDR is aWindows 11feature that, ironically, is designed to enhance your gaming visuals automatically. If you turn on Auto HDR, it’ll apply HDR effects to an SDR game, meaning that game will appear more vibrant and immersive on an HDR monitor. Games that support HDR natively will deliver a better visual experience, of course, but Auto HDR is much better than playing in SDR - unless, as is the case with this bug, it completely messes up your colors. In the same support document, Microsoft explains that not only does the Auto HDR bug cause colors to appear incorrectly in games, but it could cause some games to crash. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Windows Latest describes its own experience of the problem and references aReddit threadwhere user Rachidramone describes multiple games freezing or crashing entirely (including popular titles likeCall of Duty, Assassin’s Creed, and Far Cry). Microsoft’s recommendation to remedy the issue is to either turn off Auto HDR in Settings, or to avoid using Windows 11 24H2, and stick with23H2instead. Furthermore, Microsoft has enacted a ‘compatibility hold’ for PCs that have Auto HDR enabled, which means that these devices won’t be offered the 24H2 update. When the issue is fixed, 24H2 will then be rolled out to those PCs again. Microsoft also warned against bypassing its upgrade block, and manually installing 24H2 (using, for example, the media creation tool), if you use Auto HDR at all. For those who have already installed the 24H2 update, Microsoft recommends turning off Auto HDR to get things back to normal. You can do this by heading toSettings > System > Display, and then selectingGraphics. Under the ‘Default Settings’ panel you’ll see the toggle for Auto HDR and you just need to turn this off to disable it for all games, which is what I’d recommend. (However, this can also be done on a per-game basis via the ‘Custom settings for applications’ panel, should you wish). Microsoft has said it’s working to fix the bug now, and will provide more information when it’s available. According to Windows Latest, the cure should be rolled out in the near future. Windows 11 24H2 is clearly still finding its feet, especially when it comes to gaming. A bunch of bugs in 24H2 have hit PC gamers, unfortunately, includingissues with anti-cheat systems, random crashes of one sort or another, and someserious glitches with Ubisoft games in particular. If you’re not looking to deal with unexpected bugs and blips, it’s probably best to be a little cautious when it comes to updating to 24H2, and maybe hold off on upgrading until it becomes more stable and predictable. Hopefully, it won’t be too long before that happens.","Microsoft admits Windows 11 24H2 is causing problems with displaying colors using Auto HDR, and crashing games too.",TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/gamers-beware-windows-11-24h2-update-could-wreck-your-colors-and-crash-your-games,

In a recent interview withVGC, following thereveal ofThe Witcher 4at The Game Awards, narrative director Phillipp Weber addressed the fan reaction to Ciri starring as the playable protagonist. ""I think we definitely knew it could be controversial for some people because of course, in the previous threeWitchergames Geralt was the protagonist and I think everyone really loved playing as Geralt,"" Weber said. ""I really loved playing as Geralt, so I think we’re aware that if some people think right now that they would still prefer to be Geralt, I do think that’s a legitimate concern, so if this is where that concern is coming from, that’s valid."" According to Weber, the decision to make Ciri the titular Witcher of the next major game was made ""a very long time ago"" and hope to deliver on ""a lot of interesting things"" with Geralt of Rivia's adopted daughter at the forefront. The narrative director also pointed out that the Ciri was originally set up as the secondary main character of Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and inThe Witcher3: Wild Hunt, so for the development team ""it really was the natural evolution of what we’ve already been making for so long"".

17,Amazon stops return to office policy for US workers due to lack of office space,"Amazon’s return-to-office (RTO) policy has apparently been paused because the company doesn’t have enough office space in some locations. New reports byBloombergandBusiness Insiderstate that insufficient office space in several of theecommercegiant’s US locations has caused the temporary pause. Already a controversial move that sparked widespread worker dissatisfaction, the news follows CEO Andy Jassy’s September announcement that workers would transition from their previous three-day office-working policy to a full-time mandate, which left a bitter taste in the mouths of many. The move would require workers to be in the office five days per week starting January 2, 2025, yet weeks before the policy is set to be enforced, and with office set to shut over Christmas and the New Year, the company has failed to provide enough office space. Jassy had hoped that bringing people back into the office would enable better collaboration, cohesion and social benefits. The policy is more akin to pre-pandemic working setups, with assigned desks, rather than more flexible measures that have followed in the post-pandemic world of hybrid working. Due to capacity limitations in offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, New York and Phoenix, some staff have been told that they might not need to go in full-time for another four months. The company toldGeekWirethat most of its offices would meet the January 2 target, but acknowledged that some locations might be delayed. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Employees who were previously working remotely, or a hybrid of the two, have previously expressed concerns that returning to the office full-time would make it difficult for them. Many would have to relocate or change their lifestyles to suit, with some believing that RTO mandates are rolling out across tech giants, including Amazon, to get workers to resign.

But that hasn’t stopped it from facing increased scrutiny in the US, and while the company has just narrowly escaped being banned altogether in the United States, things could look very different in a year’s time. So, what’s happened? Well, the US Senate has just passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which allocates defense spending for the year. ToDJI’s relief, it did not contain any provisions from the Countering CCP Drones Act, which sought to essentiallyblock imports of all DJI productsinto the United States. But DJI isn’t out of the woods yet. The NDAA has started a one-year countdown, during which DJI has to prove that its products are not a national security risk to the United States. If it can’t, all of its devices will be automatically banned in the US, as will those of rival firmAutel Robotics. DJI must prove its innocence to “an appropriate national security agency” (which has not yet been named). Otherwise, the FCC will add DJI products to its “covered list,"" which would block DJI devices from running on US networks and prevent the FCC from authorizing their internal radios for use in the United States. It would essentially be an import ban. DJI is a Chinese company that has provoked ire and suspicion among US lawmakers. As with many Chinese companies, some in the US are concerned that DJI could have overly close links to the Chinese authorities and that its products could pose a national security threat. In ablog post, DJI has responded to the allegations by saying it “welcomes the scrutiny and looks forward to the opportunity to demonstrate our privacy controls and security features.” The company also claims that Chinese firms are being unfairly singled out and worries that the US government has not yet assigned an agency to carry out the assessment – if no agency takes charge, DJI will be banned automatically, it believes. TheNDAA has passedboth the House of Representatives and the US Senate, meaning it just requires President Biden’s signature. While Biden is almost certain to sign it as it received bipartisan support, it remains to be seen what action – if any – President-elect Trump will take once he assumes office in January.

19,Lighter. Better. Faster. Stronger. The legendary laptops that created today's killer kit,"Modern gaming laptops are lighter, slimmer, and more powerful than ever,but how did we get from the bulky pioneers of portable gaming to today’s thin and sleek kit which boast AAA-ready performance? Gaming has changed drastically in the last two decades, with new releases continuing to defy the recurring belief that graphics are the best they’ll ever be. In 20 years, we’ve seen a jump fromGrand Theft Auto: San AndreastoCyberpunk 2077, fromHalo 2toBlack Myth: Wukong, alongside countless other examples. While software and artist developers have continued to evolve their craft to produce stunningly realistic games like those we have today, so too have hardware and system manufacturers. The evolution of laptops are the gaming world’s archaeological fossils, demonstrating how form factor, weight, bulk, and performance have developed over time, making huge strides for gaming-on-the-go with each milestone. Today’s laptops can compete with their desktop counterparts, thanks to a combination of increasingly efficient graphics cards that make use of AI-enhanced tech to boost performance and visual clarity, paired with carefully designed lightweight chassis and internal cooling systems. Serving as a prime example of this progress, MSI’s RTX 40-Series powered laptops benefit from both sleek, lightweight portability and highly capable gaming performance, boosted by performance-enhancing tech such as NVIDIA DLSS. As the holiday season approaches, many of these powerful machines are on salehere,with plenty of options for every budget. With top new releases likeIndiana Jones and the Great Circlerecently released, MSI’s RTX 40-Series powered laptops are the perfect option for those looking to experience cutting-edge gaming tech. With all the advancements made this year, we’re taking a walk through history to discover exactly how we got here. The story starts way back in 2007 with the MSI GX600, the world's first overclockable laptop with MSI's exclusive Turbo Drive Engine Technology; this gave gamers the choice between better battery life or extra performance with just the push of a button. The system boasted a GeForce GT8600M, which was housed inside a squared, bulky chassis, patterned with the all-powerful red decal, a symbol that the laptop was primed and ready for gaming. A complete demon in its prime – it was the world’s first overclockable gaming laptop, after all – this old soul doesn’t quite hold the same reputation today. It’s fair to say its once-almighty GPU is somewhat outdated, and with a thick 32mm of bulk weighing a whopping 2.8kg, it’s definitely not the go-to choice when travelling. Of course, it’s no surprise that a laptop released nearly 20 years ago would struggle with the latest AAA titles, though, and it still holds a place in our hearts. Jumping forward a few years, the early 2010s saw a steady improvement in performance from both CPUs and GPUs. The MSI GS60 2PE certainly marked this moment upon its release in 2014. Shipping with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 870M, which packed 1344 cores compared to the GT8600M’s measly 32, the system was a pretty significant upgrade, especially at a time where relying on raw raster performance was the only option. Thanks to some really clever engineering, the Ghost Pro was as powerful as it was portable: it was the lightest NVIDIA 800 Series laptop on the market at just 1.96kg, and despite its huge horsepower it wasn't hefty; in fact, it was as light as many top ultrabooks that were built specifically for lightweight and slim size. Given that it was also a mere 19.9mm thick, this was a gaming wolf in sleek clothing, and the 2010 equivalent of what modern gaming laptops can achieve. In 2017, MSI pushed boundaries once more with the MSI GE62 7RE Camo Squad Limited Edition. It took its name from the very distinctive, world-first camo finish on the case, and once again MSI pulled off the tough challenge of packing high-end components into an easily portable laptop. Though a decent contender at the time, the 2.4kg and 29mm thickness is no shining star by today’s standards. However, with a choice of 15.6"" FHD or UHD displays, an optional M.2 SSD, and a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti inside, it provided an affordable and stylish option for the new generation of NVIDIA GPU systems. The Camo Squad’s secret power was not only within its display, however, as the GTX 1050 Ti was the first series of GPUs to support NVIDIA Reflex, a latency-reducing setting which would have a notable impact on gaming and esports for years to come. This new architecture was a true upgrade, breaking records for both performance and efficiency, offering the best experiences available in top releases at the time, especially with the growing surge of VR. In 2020 MSI launched the MSI GT76 Titan with the astonishing NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER. There was no camo this time, but the Titan was super-stealthy in its sleek black case – or at least it was until you hit the lights to see its RGB keyboard and accents. Made with a streamlined aluminum cover and carbon fiber-themed bodywork it was absolutely stunning, though at a cost. Packing the mighty RTX 2080 SUPER into this system required some compromises, most notably its 4.2kg of weight and 42mm bulk. Though it undoubtedly made an impactful first impression and benefited from a sturdy feel, it wasn’t the ideal system to be lugging around on-the-go. Nonetheless, the Titan had serious power to match the style, with an i9 10900K inside, boasting 20 threads and 10 cores capable of up to 5.3GHz single-core and 5.0GHz at full-core overclock. Paired with the first of the RTX series graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 2080SUPER, it delivered serious graphics power, too. This generation was a milestone for laptop gaming, introducing AI-powered, game-enhancing tech such as DLSS to boost framerates without compromising on image quality. Using dedicated Tensor Cores, the RTX 2080 SUPER was the beginning of the current evolution in gaming. The challenge with all that power is how to keep it cool, and MSI had that covered with an extreme cooling system that made use of four fans and 11 heat pipes to deliver 2.25x the airflow of previous cooling systems. That enabled it to deliver massive performance without being held back by pesky thermal throttling. Those years of evolution and revolution bring us to today, where MSI and NVIDIA have combined all the lessons of the last two decades to create a sleek, light, and incredibly powerful laptop – the MSI Stealth 14 AI Studio. The first thing you'll notice about the Stealth 14 AI Studio is the striking two-tone design available in Pure White or Star Blue. Beneath those colours is the super-light and super-strong magnesium alloy chassis, a premium material that helped MSI get the weight down to just 1.7kg in a case that's only 19mm thick. That’s more than a kg lighter than the 2007 MSI GX600, and almost half the bulk – a pretty sizable improvement. Don't let that lightweight and thin chassis fool you: there's a serious engine room in there, with up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU, complemented by a powerful NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 4060. Building on the foundation of the 20-Series GPUs, the 40-Series cards support the next generation of AI-enhancing DLSS 3 tech, which introduced Frame Generation to supported titles, further boosting performance by more than 2x the framerate compared to native processing. That performance wouldn't be sustainable without MSI's expertise in cutting-edge CPU and GPU cooling. The Stealth 14 AI Studio is designed with a dedicated vapor chamber cooler on the CPU and GPU, which can manage the thermal flow and maximize performance. The larger heat capacity reduces the noise and temperature, keeping performance stable even under exceptionally high demand. With modern laptops weighing sometimes less than half the weight of previous models, taking up a fraction of the space with significantly reduced bulk, and housing GPUs five times more powerful than even the previous generation in certain titles, laptop gaming has never been better.

According to Chrome researcher@Leopeva64from X (formerly Twitter), the latest Chrome Canary build has a new feature that, when switched on, will automatically archive duplicate tabs. If you have several tabs duplicating information, Chrome will archive the older ones and leave the most recent one in the tab switcher. This is only for the Android version of the browser, with the process remaining manual on the desktop version. Keep in mind that this is still only usable inCanaryand therefore for only developers, meaning there’s no guarantee that it’ll be released globally as a stable build. That said, users can still install the Canary version of the browser and test out the feature for themselves. Google Chrome for Android isn’t the only mobile version that’s been getting attention. TheiOS versionhas been getting plenty of love too. Back in November 2024, four upgrades were announced: improvements toGoogle Lenssearch, online shopping, and integrations with Google Drive,Google Photos, andGoogle Maps.

21,"Microsoft lays out reasons Windows 10 gamers should upgrade to Windows 11, but I can pick a few holes in these arguments","Microsoftis keen to pushWindows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11, and the latest part of that drive is persuading PC gamers that they need to make the leap to its newest OS. Neowinspotted ablog postfrom Microsoft on how to ‘Elevate your PC gaming experience withWindows 11this holiday season’ outlining all the perks gamers get with theoperating system. (Assuming you can upgrade fromWindows 10– not every PC will meetWindows 11’s more stringent system requirements). The biggest carrots to make the move to Windows 11, as Microsoft sees it, include theAuto HDR feature, which gives SDR games anHDRmakeover (for those with a supporting monitor). Then there’s also DirectStorage, which turbocharges loading times considerably (and in-game frame rates, too) for those with NVMe SSDs (the caveat being that the game must be coded to support this tech). Microsoft’s third highlight isCompact Mode for Game Bar, which allows the bar to be downsized to make it more usable on small displays such as the screens on gaming handhelds like theAsus Rog Ally X. Other major features that have the spotlight shone on them are Dynamic Lighting, which gives you a central hub for controlling all devices with RGB lights, and Windows 11’s optimizations for running games in windowed mode. The latter smooths over lag and screen tearing issues that you might otherwise suffer when playing a game in a window rather than full-screen. Further, more minor benefits are listed too, including the HDR Calibration app (does what it says on the colorful tin), color filters for colorblind players, and Automatic Super Resolution for upscaling tricks – but that last one is forArm-based Copilot+ PCs only as it uses the beefy NPU on those machines. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. What’s the reality of these Windows 11 features – do they really make life for PC gamers better? Well, yes, they do, but there are considerations Microsoft doesn’t mention here. Fair play on Auto HDR, which is a great feature for those withHDR monitors, as it really does elevate the visual quality of SDR games (those that don’t offer native HDR support). You must have an HDR display, though, of course. DirectStorage is also an excellent feature, but again, there’s a hardware requirement, which is an NVMe SSD. The bigger catch with this game-speeding tech, though, is that it must be supported, and there aren’t many titles that do so (approaching 20 games or so). I should also note that DirectStorage works in Windows 10; it simply works better and speeds things up more in Windows 11, though. Compact Mode for Game Bar is only useful for gaming handhelds, as already observed, and the rest of the tricks Microsoft brings our attention to in the blog post are helpful but more bonus trimmings than anything meaty. Anecdotally, Windows 11 doesn’t run games appreciably faster than Windows 10 in the main, but there may be outliers, and of course, DirectStorage will help very much in supported titles. Auto HDR is definitely nice for those with an appropriate monitor, but is all this a compelling argument for a Windows 11 upgrade? Not hugely, in my opinion, though it depends very much on your PC setup and whether you fall into any of the above categories. That said, upgrading to Windows 11 doesn’t really have any downsides, either – although you might want to stay off the 24H2 update untilMicrosoft fixessome of thefair few problemsthat have hit PC gamers who’ve upgraded to the latest version. One final reason to upgrade that Microsoft doesn’t mention is if you have anAMDRyzen 7000 or 9000 processor,there’s tuning work in Windows 11(23H2 and 24H2) that boosts the speed of the CPU for gaming by a hefty amount (something like 10% faster). For those running that silicon in theirgaming PC, this could be a compelling reason to make the jump. At any rate, those on Windows 10 must consider their next move soon, as the operating system will hit End of Life in October 2025. ExpectMicrosoft to not shut up about thisas next year progresses, so if you’ve been mulling a Windows 11 upgrade, you may as well get on with it soon enough. It’s either that or stumping up the cash to get anextra year’s support for Windows 10– or switching to an entirely different desktop OS.

22,"The first official trailer for James Gunn's Superman movie has been revealed, and I'm utterly obsessed with the DCU's take on Krypto the Superdog","The first trailer for 2025'sSupermanmovie is finally here – and, if I wasn't already excited for the DC Cinematic Universe's (DCU) first film, I certainly am now. Unveiled today (December 20), the two-minute-plus trailer, which arrived 24 hours after DC Studiosreleased a teaser for the actualSupermanmovie trailer, is all thatI and many other Superman fans wanted for Christmas this year. If this first proper look at the superhero filmis anything to go by, it's going to be one of the biggestnew moviesto launch in theaters in 2025, too.

For one, we get first looks at the Man of Steel's fellow heroes in action, including Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Isabela Merced's Hawkgirl, and Edi Gathegi's Mister Terrific. All of them are shown using their weapons and/or abilities to fight their enemies – or, in Gardner's case, keep Metropolis' population away from Clark Kent/Superman, who retreats into a building to escape an angry mob for reasons unknown. Are they simply afraid of who or what he is, or did he accidentally cause some major damage while (ironically) trying to save them from some intergalactic threat? Regardless, this isn't the first time we've seen Supes' fellow heroes before. During production, leaked images emerged online that gave us ourfirst look at Gethegi's Mister Terrific in his comics-accurate costume, with other imagesshowing us Merced's Hawkgirl and Fillion's Green Lantern, both of whom appear to be working (initially, at least) for anotherDCvillain in Maxwell Lord. Then there are are the multiple, ominous shots ofNicholas Hoult's imposing version of Lex Luthor, aka one of the legendary DC hero's most notorious foes. There are also a fair few clips of Clark Kent/Supes and perennial love interest Lois Lane getting physically intimate. Oh, and there's also a kaiju of sorts that the eponymous Kryptonian will square off against, as well as two other engimatic foes –one of whom was teased when the first image of 2025'sSupermanmovie was revealedearlier this year. The true star of the show, though, is Superman's fluffy best friend in Krypto the Superdog. Appearing in one of the trailer's longer clips between the 1:06 and 1:22 mark, we see the canine Kryptonian – who'sbased on Gunn's own rescue dog Ozu– racing through the arctic tundra to aid Clark, who looks utterly exhausted after a bruising encounter with...something. I wonder if this scene takes place after he battles that clad-in-black individual on an American football field... Anyway, Krypto doesn't think twice about helping his fellow alien when Clark/Supes asks Krypto to ""take me home"". And, considering wealready know Krypto will cross paths with Mister Terrificat some point in theDCU Chapter Onemovie, Superman won't be the only hero that Krypto interacts with. We may head to theaters to watch the legendary DC hero take flight on the big screen once more, but we (or, at the very least, I) will be paying to watch Krypto be a good and mischievous boy.

He's joined by fellow studio co-chief Peter Safran, as well as other producers in Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo, and Lars Winther, on the film's executive producing team.","The first trailer for James Gunn's Superman movie has taken flight, and it's got everyone talking about one very good boy in particular.",TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/the-first-official-trailer-for-james-gunns-superman-movie-has-been-revealed-and-im-utterly-obsessed-with-the-dcus-take-on-krypto-the-superdog,
23,Elevated levels of 'forever chemicals' found in smartwatch bands – here's what you need to know,"Scientists from the University of Notre Dame have called for more comprehensive studies and greater transparency from manufacturers after a study found elevated levels of so-called ""forever chemicals"" in some consumer smartwatch and fitness tracker bands. The study,published this week in Environmental Science & Technology Letters, analyzed 22 watch bands from numerous brands and price points and found that some of these bands contained elevated levels of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances), namely perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). These chemicals are colloquially known as ""forever chemicals"" because they have an almost unbreakable chemical structure which means they don't degrade or break down over time. The tested brands include many of thebest smartwatchmanufacturers and accessory makers includingApple(andApple WatchNike sport bands), CASETiFY,Fitbit,Google, andSamsung. As reported byNotre Dame News, nine of the 22 bands tested contained elevated levels of PFHxA, with more expensive bands generally found to have higher levels. ""The most remarkable thing we found in this study was the very high concentrations of just one PFAS — there were some samples above 1,000 parts per billion of PFHxA, which is much higher than most PFAS we have seen in consumer products,"" said Graham Peaslee, study co-author and professor emeritus in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. ""This discovery stands out because of the very high concentrations of one type of forever chemical found in items that are in prolonged contact with our skin,"" Peaslee toldIndependent. ""We have never seen extractable concentrations in the part-per-million range for any wearable consumer product applied to the skin,"" he warned. The study's lead author, Alyssa Wicks, recommends buying lower-cost silicone bands, or avoiding products listed as containing fluoroelastomers if they want a more expensive band. While the study does mention some big names in the smartwatch sector, notably Apple, Samsung, and Google, it's difficult to extrapolate too much because the study doesn't give the results for each brand. Companies like Apple clearly advertise Fluoroelastomer as present in itsbest Apple Watch bands, notably its Nike offerings, Sport Band, and the Apple Watch Ultra's Ocean band. However, the study doesn't tell us which of the bands offered by these major players were tested, or if they were the bands with notably high PFA levels. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Samsung and CASETiFY were not immediately available to comment on the story. Apple pointed TechRadar to its work on testing materials and itscommitmentto totally phasing out PFAS from its products and manufacturing processes from 2022. More specifically, Apple also highlighted itsRegulated Substances Specification document, which specifically lists PFHxA, the offending chemical highlighted in the study, as a restricted substance. Apple says that for PFHxA, its salts and related substances, it has a threshold limit of ""25 ppb for the sum of PFHxA and its salts"" and ""1000 ppb for the sum of PFHxA-related substances."" As Wicks notes, there are also ""few studies"" on the absorption of PFAS through the skin. She cites one such article that found that a couple of types of PFAS had ""significant transfer through the skin"", but that it was a limited study that only examined 20 of the 14,000 known types of PFAS. Speaking toYahoo Life, Jamie Alan, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University called the findings ""interesting"", but said that the study doesn't give any insight into how much PFHxA is absorbed through the skin, if any is absorbed at all. Other specialists in toxicology and dermatology agreed, stating that it is unlikely a significant amount of PXHxA would be absorbed through the skin. Finally, Alan pointed out that the study involved chemically extracting these compounds from Apple Watch bands, something users aren't doing when they wear these items day-to-day. ""So although they found very high levels, that does not mean any significant amount is getting into our system,"" she concluded. Alan said there's no need to panic if you own a smartwatch or fitness tracker band with fluoroelastomer, but that ""it is good to be aware of cumulative exposure."" If you're looking for a new band, you could always choose a PFAS-free option.",Scientists have found elevated levels of potentially harmful chemicals in Apple Watch bands.,TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/elevated-levels-of-forever-chemicals-found-in-smartwatch-bands-heres-what-you-need-to-know,
24,Thousands of GPS tracking customers have info leaked following data breach,"Hapn, a company that sellsGPS trackinghardware and software, is reportedly spilling sensitive user information online, and is not responding to researcher alerts or media inquiries, experts have claimed. In late November 2024, a security researcher reached out toTechCrunch, saying they observed a bug in Hapn’s website, which allows malicious actors to view the exposed data using the developer tools in the web browser. The data being exposed apparently includes customer names, and the names of their workplace. It also includes data on more than 8,600 GPS trackers, and IMEI numbers for their SIM cards. Location data is not included, though. TechCrunch analyzed some of the data, and even reached out to a few people whose names were found in the leaked data, and confirmed the information is correct. Hapn is used by both commercial entities, and individuals, with the company advertising its tools as means of tracking valuables and loved ones, and claims there are more than 460,000 active devices, with customers reportedly including some Fortune 500 companies. Tracking services are always a sensitive topic, whether they are hardware, or software-based, since in many instances, they are abused to spy on people and track their location without consent or knowledge. Misconfigured databases, website bugs, and other errors, can happen to anyone. How the companies respond to being notified is what matters, and in this case, it seems that Hapn failed. TechCrunch says “several emails” to the CEO went unreturned, and some even bounced with an error message that the address is non-existent. “The company does not have a web page or form for reporting security vulnerabilities,” the publication added.

27,Sick of your AirTags dying on you? This new accessory gives them a decade-long battery life,"Apple’sAirTagsare great for finding your lost items, but their batteries don’t last forever. And while their button cells are easy enough to swap out, wouldn’t it be better if you just didn’t have to worry about changing their batteries at all? That seems to be the motivation behind an opinion-splitting new product from Elevation Labs that promises to extend your AirTags’ battery life to a decade or more. Dubbed theTimeCapsule, the device is essentially a large case for your AirTag that boosts its battery life to ten years. The black housing is roomy enough for two AA batteries, which offer up to 14 times the longevity of the CR2032 cell inside a regular AirTag. To use it, you just take the top half of an AirTag and attach it to the white plate inside the TimeCapsule, which is what sends the AA batteries’ power to your AirTag. The enclosure can be screwed securely shut and is nondescript enough to not attract attention from a would-be thief. According to the TimeCapsule’sAmazon page, it also has an IP69 rating, enabling it to keep out dust and high-pressure liquids. You might be noticing the elephant in the room here: namely, the TimeCapsule seriously compromises the AirTag’s portability, which is one of its key selling points. After all, it’s harder to slip a TimeCapsule into your compact flight luggage than a tiny AirTag. And attaching one to your keyring? Forget it. Sure, it’s not obnoxiously large, but it’s still much bigger than a regular AirTag. Whether that’s a problem depends on how you intend to use it. If you want something that has better weatherproofing than Apple’s AirTag, it might be a good option. Similarly, if you’re not bothered that it takes up a little more room in your bags, you likely won’t be put off by its added bulk. But if you want a small tracker that can fit pretty much anywhere, it’s a little less viable. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The TimeCapsule costs $20 for a single pack (around £15 / AU$32), $30 for two and $40 for four. It can be bought from theElevation Labs websiteor fromAmazon.

29,The EU could force Apple to put AirDrop and AirPlay on Android phones,"A new round of EU proposals have firmly suggested thatApplemake its exclusive features available to other developers and phone makers. Under the proposals, EU residents may not need to buy aniPhone 16for themselves to use features like AirDrop, AirPlay, and automatic audio switching. Allowing other companies to use long-exclusive Apple features APIs would mark a significant step up in the EU’s ongoing efforts to loosen Apple’s control of the smartphone market in the region. An API – Application Programming Interface – is a piece of software that allows two applications to communicate, forming the foundation for features like AirDrop. These exclusive elements of the Apple ecosystem have long been considered major perks of buying an iPhone. The proposals are the latest suggestions made in relation to the Digital Markets Act, a piece of EU legislation that regulates the activity and competition of online storefronts and tech companies. Apple has already responded with a paper titled “Interoperability December 2024”, which claims that “abuse” of the DMA could result in the loss of user privacy. The paper says Meta has made 15 requests for wide-reaching access to Apple device technology, and suggests Apple would be unable to reject these should the latest round of DMA proposals be enforced. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As well as iPhone features, the latest round of suggestions focuses on the exclusive audio and notification features enabled on theApple Watchand AirPods. The EU has requested that Apple allow third-party accessories the same notification systems as its own products. AsAndroid Authorityreports, the EU has repeatedly demonstrated that it finds that Apple’s market dominance and tightly controlled ecosystem give the company an unfair advantage over the competition. The suggestions do not seem to be immediately binding, but it is ostensibly within the EU’s purview to use the DMA to enforce them. Apple has previously been seemingly forced to make begrudging concessions under the DMA,such as switching to USB-C with the iPhone 15and allowing sideloading of apps through unofficial channels – but API access feels like a step too far. The DMA has been instrumental in puncturing the popular view of tech companies as invincible entities, and shown time and time again that even the top dogs can be compelled to change. However, if the DMA exists to foster competition, it’s worth remembering that companies need something to compete with. Phones in particular have been on something of a performance plateau that’s only just coming to an end this year, so internal specs are rarely going to be enough to pull customers in. Exclusive features, like AirDrop and AirPlay, give Apple something to offer. It’s great thatGoogleis so open with Android – I make frequent use of all the interoperability features of the platform when switching between handsets for reviews – but I’m not convinced that this is a precedent Apple should be made to follow. Furthermore, I’m inclined to believe Apple’s concern for user privacy. The companypreviously faced down the FBIin order to protect the integrity of its ecosystem, and I’m always pleasantly surprised by privacy features when using my iPad, MacBook, or on the rare occasions I use an iPhone. Apple has received its fair share of criticism over the years, some earned, some not. But one thing the company has done is work hard to create a singular vision and sense of flow through its ecosystem. If the company is forced to offer its prized exclusive features publicly, I’ll wonder how long it’ll take before we see Android phones with Apple logos printed on the back.","The latest round of EU proposals under the Digital Markets Act means Apple may be compelled to avail AirDrop, AirPlay, and other exclusive APIs to Android phone makers, a move the company says would leave user privacy at risk.",TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-eu-could-force-apple-to-put-airdrop-and-airplay-on-android-phones,
30,Microsoft really wants users to ditch passwords and switch to passkeys,"Passwords are no longer good enough,Microsofthas said, as it signals a shift towards easier to use and more secure alternatives. “At Microsoft, we block 7,000 attacks on passwords per second—almost double from a year ago. At the same time, we’ve seen adversary-in-the-middle phishing attacks increase by 146% year over year,” the companysaidin a new blog post. “Fortunately, we’ve never had a better solution to these pervasive attacks: passkeys.” Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords as their private encryption key is only stored on a local device, such as your phone, and not on leaky servers that are liable being attacked. Passkeys also don’t need to be entered into a website - just verifying your identity using a biometricauthenticator appthat scans your face or a fingerprint will grant you entry to your account. This also makes them phishing resistant, as an attacker would not only need your personal device to log in, but also your physical form to pass authentication. As an additional bonus, you don’t have to worry about forgetting a passkey, as it isn’t stored in your brain and doesn’t need to be written down or stored in apassword manager. Over the past year, Microsoft has stepped up the rollout of passkeys to its platforms, with passkey support being added toXbox, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Copilotin May 2024. The slow rollout allowed users to become familiar with the option of signing in with a passkey or, as it is displayed on the login page, “face, fingerprint, or PIN,” which users were more familiar with. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Following this, Microsoft began “nudging” users into adopting passkeys at important points in the user experience, such as at account creation, after signing in, and when resetting passwords. Experiments with messaging were also run, with Microsoft discovering that saying passkeys are “more secure” and “faster” saw a click through rate of 24% and 27% respectively. Additionally, Microsoft did not let users completely opt out of passkey usage by having the button say “Skip for now.” Microsoft then moved on to removing friction from the sign in experience by defaulting to passkey authentication if it was available as a login method, removing the need for users to remember passwords and type them in. As for the future, Microsoft is aiming to eventually phase out passwords, and introduce a totally passwordless login experience using phishing-resistant credentials only. However, there is still a long way to go until then, including introducing passkeys as the default, phasing out passwords, and then stopping password support altogether - so get ready for a passwordless future.","Microsoft sees a passwordless future, and is slowly nudging users towards its ultimate vision.",TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/microsoft-really-wants-users-to-ditch-passwords-and-switch-to-passkeys,
31,Improved Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses could land in 2025 – with a much requested upgrade,"While the consumer version of its impressiveMeta Orion AR glassesprototype isn’t due to land any time soon, we might get a taste of what’s to come from the AR revolution next year as reports suggest we’ll get newRay-Ban Meta smart glassesnext year which incorporate “single small in-lens screen.” That’s per theWall Street Journalwho says “a person familiar with the project” suggested that the Ray-Ban update is due in 2025, and that it could launch alongside the sensor wristband that early testers have used to control Orion. The report added that while Meta wouldn’t confirm if this heads-up-display feature would be coming, a viewfinder that could show basic information like notifications was a much-requested feature according to Alex Himel, Meta’s vice president of wearables. We should take rumors with a pinch of salt, but the display-equipped Meta Ray-Bans were previously teased back in 2023 by a leak fromThe Vergewhich revealed Meta’s internal roadmap – a roadmap which pegged 2025 as the release year for these glasses. This is also a good sign for people wanting to get their hands on Orion, as that same leaked roadmap said full-on AR smart specs would drop in 2027. Assuming Meta is on track with Orion that means we could be wearing them in only two years, which feels almost too soon for the AR revolution. As for when we might see the display packing Ray-Bans, sometime in September or October is most likely given Meta’s typical release schedule; it usually likes to showcase new hardware at Meta Connect which lands in that slot nearing the end of the year. It could always mix things up in 2025, but expect to be waiting a few more months for this improved smart glasses if they are indeed on the way. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses have been one of the best – if notthebest – gadget of the year for me.

And if the upgrade can come without a price increase – admittedly unlikely – or at least not a massive one, and maintain the stylish design of the current model, then I could see these upgraded specs easily supplanting everything else out there. My only concern would be battery life. The current glasses only have a four-ish hour maximum based on usage, and a display (even a simple small one) could eat into that. Though Meta would be aware of this and may have designed new and improved batteries to ensure your glasses don’t switch off after two minutes, and at least if they do run out of charge you can always rely on them as a pair of stylish specs.",Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses could get a much requested display upgrade – but these aren’t Orion yet.,TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/improved-meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-could-land-in-2025-with-a-much-requested-upgrade,

33,"New PS5 Pro details explain what ""advanced ray tracing"" really means","A new technical seminar featuring PlayStation 5 Pro lead console architect Mark Cerny has been posted to the official PlayStationYouTubechannel. It provides some interesting new insights into the hardware that powers thePS5 Pro, including an explanation of what “advanced ray tracing” actually means. The video is quite technical and begins with Cerny outlining whatSonyis hoping to achieve with the PS5 Pro. He says that each new generation of consoles targets “broad improvements” and “significant new capabilities” that allow for a “tremendous step up in what the player experiences”. Mid-generation refreshes like the PS5 Pro, in contrast, are much more “tightly focused” and generally hone in on a few key areas like the GPU. When developing the PS5 Pro, Cerny states that the focus was to create minimal extra work for developers while still offering games that play “noticeably better”. Cerny also details some of the technical improvements in the PS5 Pro. While not entirely new information, it does provide a useful recap. He explains that the 16GB of GGDR6 RAM found in the console is 28% faster than PS5, with over 1GB more memory available to games in order to help with PSSR, ray tracing, and increased rendering resolution. The PS5 Pro also features 2GB of slower DDR5 RAM for theoperating system. He goes on to address some common misconceptions, specifically regarding the power of the PS5 Pro’s GPU. He states that the GPU runs at 16.7 TFLOPs, debunking an earlier myth that it actually ran at a massive 33.5 TFLOPs. He reaffirms the claim that, overall, developers can expect to achieve a 45% increase in rendering speed which he calls “a huge improvement.” We also get some insight into what the PS5 Pro’s advanced ray tracing entails in technical terms. He states that one of the “top priorities” of PS5 Pro development was “finding ways to accelerate” the computation of ray tracing.

He estimates that calculation of rays now occurs at roughly “double or triple the speed of PS5”. He also explains a new acceleration structure and stack management in hardware. Put simply, the new acceleration structure interprets data regarding simulated geometry in order to work out where rays hit objects via an intersection engine. Objects are divided into “boxes”, which make it easier for the engine to work out which ones will be affected by rays. Every time a box is intersected by a ray, it reduces in size to narrow down exactly what needs to be simulated. Compared to the PS5, the PS5 Pro encodes boxes in larger groups with an intersection engine that is twice as fast - massively increasing ray tracing performance. The stack management in hardware then addresses the issue of divergence - which occurs when certain pixels being processed require different actions to others, generally increasing the time needed to render them. This impacts ray tracing performance, as there are lots of possible ways for a ray to be interpreted when it comes to curved or bumpy surfaces. While the base PS5 uses a complex stack management system to accommodate for this, on PS5 Pro, stack management is in the console’s hardware - simplifying the process which “further increases the speed of execution”. This, in addition to a few other changes, leads to significantly more consistent ray tracing performance, helping games look and run better.

34,Creature Commandos stars open up on how episode 4's two huge plot twists will impact the DCU TV show's overall story: 'it's an interesting reveal',"Creature Commandosepisode 4 marks the official midpoint of theMaxshow – and it might be the most eye-opening chapter of the R-rated animated series yet. Based on its seemingly innocent title 'Chasing Squirrels',Creature Commandos' latest entry doesn't appear to be particularly shocking on the surface. Looks, though, can be deceiving, and episode 4 proves how true that statement can be with two big plot twists that few will have seen coming. Major spoilers immediately follow for 'Chasing Squirrels'. Don't scroll past this point if you haven't watched the DC Cinematic Universe (DCU) show's latest episode yet. The first surprise turn of events centers on Princess Ilana of Pokolistan. As I explained in anotherCreature Commandosepisode 4 exclusive –one based around the apparent debut of the DCU's Justice League– it seems Pokolistan's de facto ruler isn't as innocent as she's letting on. Indeed, when the series' supposed main villain Circe shows ARGUS chief Amanda Waller a potential vision of the future, it's a premonition that revolves around Ilana and Pokolistan autocratically ruling the Earth. Later in the episode, Waller drafts in Doctor Ilana MacPherson, a university professor who specializes in Themyscira, aka Circe's place of birth and one ofthree big references thatCreature Commandosincludes to tease Wonder Woman's eventual DCU debut. As MacPherson explains, Circe is a clairvoyant, which means she isn't able to imagine potential future scenarios on the spot. That, then, must mean Circe is telling the truth about Ilana and Pokolistan. Or is she? Speaking to TechRadar ahead of episode 4's release, Maria Bakalova, who voices Ilana, suggested there'll be more twists and turns beforeCreature Commandos' final chapter, which will keep viewers on their toes and ensure they won't know whether they can trust Ilana, MacPherson, or Circe. ""It's an interesting reveal,"" Bakalova said with a smile when I quizzed on episode 4's plot twist. ""It's done in such a gentle way that it makes you think 'is it real, or is Circe lying?'. You don't know who you can trust out of Circe or Ilana. I'm really happy that the show is built in a way that keeps that tension throughout, so you can't tell if Ilana is as good as Rick Flag Sr thinks she is, or if she's actually the bad guy in all of this. You're never completely convinced."" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As I alluded to, there's another big story-based moment in one of thebest Max shows' fourth episode, and it's one focused squarely on Weasel. Weasel's backstory has been referenced throughoutCreature Commandos, with different characters mentioning that he was accused of killing 27 children. That's the reason why he was incarcerated in Belle Reve Correctional Center in the first place. Or so we were led to believe. In an emotionally devastating flashback sequence, which intersects theDCU Chapter Oneseries' present day storyline, we learn Weasel actually tried to save a bunch of kids when a fire breaks out at their school. He fails to do so, however, because he's shot and captured by law enforcers who mistake Weasel for causing the blaze and, in their eyes, attempting to steal the children in order to eat them. DCStudios' co-head James Gunn previously described episode 4's harrowing trip down memory lane as one of the saddest things he's ever written. True though that may be, such scenes require performers – among other things, such as its musical score – to effectively communicate how much a gut-punch these moments are. So, how did Sean Gunn, James' brother and the voice actor responsible for playing Weasel, convey such anguish with a character who can't talk? ""As an actor, sometimes you don't have the tools to make something work,"" Sean Gunn told me ahead of episode 4's release. ""When I'm playing Weasel, all I've got are squeaks, grunts, and growls. You don't know who you can trust out of Circe or Ilana ""But, James and I talked a lot about how Weasel is like a big dog, and anyone who has a dog knows that they're incredibly emotional creatures who can experience joy, pain, sadness, all those kind of things. So, that's what I'm trying to get to the heart of when recording Weasel. That was really interesting because, in [2021DCEUmovie]The Suicide Squad, he was such an afterthought who was viewed as a goofball and just some form of comic relief. To be able to take that character and have to do something with him that has some real emotional resonance, that was very challenging for me, but I really loved doing it.""

In a recent video interview with BG2Pod, Nadella hinted at Windows’ openness and support for interoperability, noting that competitor AI tools, like Google’s Gemini,OpenAI’sChatGPTand Anthropic’s Claude, are all available to use on the operating system. In other words, Windows users aren’t locked into using Microsoft’s Copilot suite. Google doesn’t make its money by selling Micorosft’s operating system, though. Instead, its pervasion of the platform and of many computers in general has helped the company to secure multiple revenue streams.

36,Apple’s long-rumored iPhone subscription service has reportedly been scrapped,"We’ve beenhearing talk of an iPhone subscription servicesince 2022, but now this rumored service – which would allow you to get new iPhones on a subscription – has apparently been abandoned byApplebefore it could even launch. This is according to Mark Gurman, writing forBloomberg(via9to5Mac) and citing “people familiar with the matter”. Gurman claims this decision is “part of a broader shift in how Apple approaches payment services.” As a reminder, this iPhone subscription service would reportedly have let you pay a monthly fee, and then be able to swap your iPhone for a new one every year. But you likely wouldn’t ever have owned the iPhone – you’d have to return it to get a new one, and probably also have to return it if you canceled the subscription, so you’d essentially be leasing it rather than paying it off over time. While this service may have proven useful for some buyers, this claim that Apple has abandoned the idea isn’t entirely surprising. For one thing, this service had already reportedly faced numerous delays and issues. Initial reports suggested the service would launch around the time of theiPhone 14, but Gurman claims that issues, such as software bugs and regulatory concerns, held it back. Gurman speculates that the idea was ultimately abandoned due to the fact that it would have been in competition with – and potentially upset – Apple’s wireless carrier partners, as well as due to stricter rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Arguably though it’s not a service that’s even that needed, since Apple already offers aniPhone Upgrade Program. This allows you to pay off your iPhone in monthly instalments, and to optionally upgrade to a new model before you’ve finished paying it off if you trade your old one in.

So the end result would likely be similar for buyers, except with the iPhone Upgrade Program you can ultimately pay off and own the phone, which seemingly wouldn’t be the case with this rumored subscription service. Of course, since Apple itself never announced this iPhone subscription service we’d take all of this information about it with a pinch of salt – it may never have been planned at all, or it may still be in the works, and exactly how it might work could differ from what we’ve heard too. But Gurman has a superb track record for Apple information, so we’re inclined to believe that it was once planned, and now isn’t.",Apple has apparently abandoned plans to let you lease iPhones with a subscription.,TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apples-long-rumored-iphone-subscription-service-has-reportedly-been-scrapped,
37,CRM vs. CDP: what’s the difference?,"In today’s hyper-connected world, data has become the lifeblood of modern businesses. Whether you’re a small e-ecommerceshop or a large multinational corporation, your success often hinges on how effectively you can harness data to make smart, informed decisions. From understanding customer behavior to optimizing marketing campaigns, data-driven decision-making is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity. As organizations increasingly recognize the power of data, the demand for sophisticated tools to manage this invaluable resource is surging. Thecustomer relationship management (CRM) softwaremarket is booming — and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Fortune Business Insights predicts the global market will nearly double in size, reaching $157 billion by 2030, up from $71 billion in 2023. However, as businesses strive to become more data-centric, many find themselves facing a confusing challenge. How do you navigate the vast sea of tech tools designed to manage and leverage customer data? Two of the most prominent solutions are Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs). But here’s where the dilemma kicks in: while both seem to offer powerful ways to manage customer data, they serve very different purposes. So, which one is right for your business? Is there a way to combine their strengths? In this article, we’ll break down the key differences between CDPs and CRMs, explore their unique functions, and help you make an informed decision on which tool — or combination of tools — best fits your needs. Chief Executive Officer at Workbooks. At its core,CRM softwareis like your business’s personal assistant for keeping track of customer relationships. Think of it as a centralized hub where every interaction with a customer is neatly organized, so nothing falls through the cracks — whether it's a potential sale, an important email, or a customer service request. The main function of aCRMis to help businesses manage and optimize the relationships they have with their customers. It keeps track of who your customers are, how and when you’ve interacted with them, and where they are in thesalesprocess. For sales teams, it's the ultimate tool for turning a lead into a loyal customer. For customer service teams, it's all about ensuring the customer feels heard and valued. Here are some of the key features that make CRM systems invaluable for modern businesses: Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Contact and lead management: At a glance, you can see every customer or lead’s detailed information and history, from phone numbers and emails to their last conversation with your team. Sales tracking and forecasting: CRMs help you see where every prospect is in the sales funnel, making it easier to forecast revenue and plan your next move. Customer interaction history: CRMs keep a record of all interactions, so anyone in your team can pick up where things left off. Task and project management: You can set tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress on customer-related projects, so no one drops the ball. A CRM is best suited for companies that prioritize sales, customer service, and relationship management. It helps teams keep track of who their customers are, how and when they’ve interacted, and what actions need to be taken to move those relationships forward. A CDP is the ultimate tool for businesses that need to make sense of the growing mountain of customer data coming from multiple sources. Unlike a CRM, which focuses on managing interactions and relationships, a CDP’s main job is to collect and unify scattered data — fromwebsiteactivity to email interactions — into one comprehensive view. In today’s digital world, where customers interact with brands across many channels, a CDP helps marketers connect the dots and truly understand who their customers are. At its heart, a CDP gathers and organizes customer data from various sources to create unified profiles that paint a complete picture of each individual. This data can come from your website, mobile app,email marketingcampaigns, social media, or even in-store purchases. The magic of a CDP lies in its ability to combine all these touchpoints into one clean, actionable profile that can be used to drive personalized marketing at scale. It’s a powerhouse for any business that wants to truly understand its customers and tailor experiences to their preferences and behaviors. The true power of a CDP lies in its ability to bring together all the fragmented pieces of customer data and turn them into something actionable. Here’s a closer look at the key features that make a CDP so effective: Centralized data from various channels: Whether it’s website clicks, social media engagement, or email open rates, a CDP pulls data from all available touchpoints into one place. Unified customer profiles: By aggregating data, a CDP builds detailed profiles for each customer, helping you understand their behaviors, preferences, and buying habits. Advanced segmentation for personalized marketing: With rich data at your fingertips, a CDP allows you to segment your audience based on a variety of factors, enabling hyper-targeted campaigns that feel personal and relevant. Integration with marketing tools: CDPs don’t just collect data — they integrate with your existing marketing tools, like email platforms and ad networks, to help you deliver seamless, data-driven campaigns. A CDP is the right choice for businesses that want to harness the full potential of customer data to fuel personalizedmarketingefforts. If your organization is looking to create a unified view of customer interactions across channels and use that data to drive hyper-targeted campaigns, then a CDP is the way to go. In an ideal world, many businesses would benefit from using both a CDP and a CRM system. While a CRM excels at tracking customer interactions and managing relationships, a CDP specializes in aggregating and unifying customer data from multiple sources. Together, they provide a 360-degree view of the customer journey, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions that can improve both sales and marketing efforts. However, budget constraints can often make this impractical. Ultimately, the choice between a CDP and a CRM comes down to your business needs and budget. While having both can provide a comprehensive view of your customers, focusing on one solution doesn't mean you're at a disadvantage. By understanding your primary goals and maximizing the features of your chosen platform, you can effectively manage customer relationships and drive growth — even on a limited budget. If you can, plan for future investments in both systems as your business grows, but for now, choose wisely based on your immediate needs. We've listed the best CRM for startups.

38,Developers targeted by malicious Microsoft VSCode extensions,"Software developers, especially those working on web3 and cryptocurrency projects, are being targeted in a brand new software supply chain attack, experts have claimed. Security researcher Amit Assaraf published a new blog post outlining how he had observed dozens of malicious Visual Studio Code extensions on the VSCode marketplace designed to download well-hiddensecond-stage payloadsfrom shady domains (some in Russia). A similar report was recently published by cybersecurity researchers Reversing Labs, who said that the campaign most likely started in October 2024. ""Throughout October 2024, the RL research team saw a new wave of malicious VSCode extensions containing downloader functionality — all part of the same campaign,"" the researchers said. ""The community was first notified of this campaign taking place in early October, and since then, the team has been steadfast in tracking it."" The packages are designed for tools like Zoom, Solidity (a programming language for smart contracts on Ethereum, among others), and more. Similar packages were found on NPM, as well. While both Reversing Labs and Assaraf did not analyze the second-stage payload,BleepingComputersays it is a “heavily obfuscated Windows CMD file” that launches a hidden PowerShell command. Its goal is to decrypt AES-encrypted strings in additional CMD files, to drop further payloads, including malware that gets flagged by just 27 out of 71 antivirus engines. While the number of compromised endpoints is difficult to determine, Assaraf says it’s most likely in the thousands. He added that the attack was very difficult to spot, since the packages check all the right boxes: Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “Looking closely, you can see it has several great indicators for it being real, the high number of installs, the official Zoom Github repo, the positive reviews.

40,"US government mulls entire TP-Link product ban - routers, switches and more all set to be blocked","The US Government is considering an all-out ban on TP-Link devices, despite the company's routers supplying roughly 65% of US homes and small businesses. A report from theWall Street Journalnoted officials are citing national security concerns as the cause of the potential ban after the Chinese-maderouters were ‘bombarded’ with malware and botnet threatsearlier in 2024. Known vulnerabilities in TP-Link devices allowed hackers to infect them with malware and compromise the machines, most commonly using Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Looking forward, the departments of Defense, Justice, and Commerce could issue a ban on the sale of the routers in the coming months, especially considering this decision will likely rest with incoming President Trump, who has signaled strong intentions to take a tough stance on China. In 2019, TP-Link supplied only 20% of home routers, but now over 300 US internet service providers currently issue TP-Link as the default internet router for home plans, and this number is growing rapidly. The devices are typically cheaper than competitors, often by over half, making them an incredibly popular choice. The routers aren’t just for home use either, with federal agencies such as NASA and the DEA using the brand, which could leave them exposed to Chinese state sponsored attacks, although US officials have not yet disclosed any evidence that TP-Link has allowed or assisted in these botnet attacks. It’snot uncommon for routers to have vulnerabilities, but the concerns reportedly come from TP-Link’s refusal to engage with security researchers.

Nine in 10 (87%) IT professionals surveyed for the report agree there is a notable lack of gender diversity within the sector, but not even half (41%) of companies have programs dedicated to hiring more women in tech. The data comes from more than 7,700 tech professionals globally, highlighting the scale and extent of the challenge. The report adds three in four (74%) businesses worldwide struggle to attract and retain talented professionals. They recognize they need broader pools of candidates and more robust talent pipelines to fill roles and plug skills gaps, yet they’re still not taking sufficient steps to hire more women. Moreover, the lack of women in tech is making it even more inaccessible for women – two in five (43%) women say that a lack of female role models in IT is a critical factor. Only one in five (21%) men see this as an issue. Furthermore, here we are just days away from 2025 and we’re still talking about pay inequality; 42% of women agree that this contributes to underrepresentation.

43,New Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Plus renders give us a clear look at their screens,"You can tell we’re getting close to the launch of theSamsung Galaxy S25series, as there are seemingly new leaks about these phones every single day. Indeed, today’s leak takes the form of some renders showing the front of theSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultraand Galaxy S25 Plus. Shared byEvan Blass– a leaker with a superb track record – these images don’t really show anything new, but they provide yet more evidence thatSamsungwill be changing the design of the Ultra by giving the new model curvier corners than theSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. That said, the corners are still less curvy in these images than those of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, presumably so that it will still be easy to distinguish Samsung’s top phone from the rest of the S25 line. Corners aside, you can see in these images that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra unsurprisingly has slightly smaller bezels than the S25 Plus. In fact, we’d recently heard thatthe Galaxy S25 Ultra might have the smallest bezels of any phone. You can also see that both phones have a single-lens punch-hole camera at the top-center of the screen, which is in line with their predecessors. Sadly, we can’t see the back of the phones here, but previous leaks – includingphotos of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plusandrenders of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra– have shown us their rear panels. Going by those, these phones look a lot like their predecessors from the back, albeit with darker rings around the camera lenses. So, we’re not expecting drastic design changes, but of course theSamsung Galaxy S25 colorsprobably will differ from those of theSamsung Galaxy S24series, and bigger changes are expected on the inside – including the likely presence of a top-endSnapdragon 8 Elitechipset.

44,The OnePlus Open 2 could come with these key upgrades – and the biggest battery yet in a foldable,"Having loved theOnePlus Open, we're ready and waiting for theOnePlus Open 2to be revealed in the first few months of 2025 – and the latest leak around the foldable has raised the anticipation level up a few more notches. According to well-known tipster@chunvn8888, the OnePlus Open 2 is going to come with some key hardware upgrades. Those upgrades include a 5,900mAh battery (up from 4,805mAh in the first model), which would be the biggest battery in a foldable to date. That's not all: the handset is set to come with IPX9 waterproofing – taking this foldable phone from ""splash resistant"" with the 2023 model to truly waterproof for the 2025 edition – and the top-endSnapdragon 8 Elitechipset from Qualcomm. The phone will apparently be led by a 50MP camera on the rear, with the same 3x optical zoom as previously. The cameras on the back are said to be arranged in a W shape, so it seems something of a redesign is on the way as well. OPPO/OnePlus foldable will have a big comeback sometime during Q1/2025, and ofc global release is guaranteed. It will pack the biggest battery size for a foldable (5900mAh) in one of the slimmist form on market , IPX9 debut, 50MP W shape IMX882 3x tele, 8 Elite SoC.December 19, 2024 This new information lines up pretty well with the OnePlus Open 2 rumors we've heard so far, though aprevious leakput the battery size at a mere 5,700mAh. That leak said the new phone would be slimmer than its predecessor too, which is backed up by @chunvn8888. The latest tip also mentions a launch window of Q1 2025 – so January, February, or March. Again, that's something we'veheard before, so it's looking increasingly likely that the foldable will break cover before we're too far through next year. In ourOnePlus Open review, we described it as the first foldable we'd seen that didn't compromise on anything – though since then theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6andGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Foldhave arrived to give OnePlus some new competition.

And it looks like threeSamsungsmart TVs have just arrived on one of those databases with a surprising change. According toDisplaySpecifications(viaNotebookcheck), there are references to multiple new SamsungOLEDTVs in the South Korean regulatory database with a product code ending in F, rather than the D used for 2024 TVs: the S85F, the S90F and the S95F. And that raises an interesting question: what happened to the E TVs? The current crop of Samsung TVs have model designation D, such as theSamsung S90D OLED. But according to the records in the database, Samsung is skipping E altogether. We have no idea why. The original actually report suggests that the S85F TV may use QD-OLED panels in some cases, but we'd be surprised if that’s the case: the S85 models are usually W-OLED to keep them affordable and we'd be amazed if that changes in 2025 We're expecting the S90F to continue to use a mix of QD-OLED and W-OLED in different sizes in 2025, based on the sizes listed here. According to the report, you can expect the S85F series to come in 55, 65, 77 and 83 inches in the US and from 55 to 77 inches in Europe. The S90F will come in sizes from 48 to 83 inches in the US and the same in Europe; and the S95F series will range from 55 to 83 inches in the US and Europe. If you've been following the sizes of theSamsung S95D, you might note that the 83-inch size is new here, and since Samsung doesn't mix QD-OLED and W-OLED panels in this model, it suggests that theleak of an 83-inch QD-OLED last monthfrom Samsung's own parts database is going to result in a new size of elite TV. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There's no information about these TVs beyond the surprise name jump and the sizes, but we're expecting to see the new models unveiled atCES 2025.

46,AMD looks to have scrapped its RX 7900 GRE – the graphics card that’s our current pick for best GPU,"AMDis ditching theRadeon RX 7900 GREfrom its current-gen GPU line-up, if fresh gossip from the grapevine is to be believed. According to a report from Dutch tech siteTweakers, the RX 7900 GRE is now end-of-life, with AMD halting production of this graphics card. Tweakers explains that it received a tip from a retail store that this was the case, with that outlet having heard from multiple suppliers that the 7900 GRE is effectively out of the mix. Add plenty of salt, but if true, once existing stock has sold through, it’ll be curtains for this popular GPU. (The RX 7900 GRE is, in fact, still currently our top pick of thebest graphics cardsout there). The site clarifies that AMD will continue to support the card with its software (driver updates), as would clearly be expected. Tweakers further notes that AMD didn’t reply to requests to confirm that the RX 7900 GRE had been discontinued, but that’s not surprising, we wouldn’t expect Team Red to do so. The report also observes that stock (presumably in The Netherlands) is dwindling, and the lack of availability backs up the notion that this RDNA 3 GPU – which was first introduced as an Asia-only model, before releasing globally – is on the way out. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Hopping on over to Newegg in the US, we note that there’s only one model of RX 7900 GRE left on sale – theAcerBiFrost spin on theAMD GPU– with all the others now out of stock. Micro Center looks to be out of stock almost entirely, too, so this graphics card does indeed seem to be vanishing. Going by reports, stock has been dwindling over the past month or two. Why might AMD be canning our favorite GPU of the moment? Well, it could be something to do with yields of the Navi 31 chip, meaning the silicon that doesn’t make the cut for higher-end RX 7900 models – which would be repurposed for the GRE – has simply run out. Of course, production of Navi 31 is likely being scaled back anyway, as we have new RDNA 4 graphics cards rumored to be launching in Q1 of 2025. Those willsupposedly include the RX 8800 XT(and more), with that GPU possibly making the RX 7900 GRE redundant in terms of its value proposition. In short, this is another sign that a potent mid-range offering is due imminently – AMD will supposedly reveal its newRDNA 4 GPUs at CES 2025, with the boards launching soon after – and we can’t wait to see how those RX 8000 models shape up.

47,"Creature Commandos episode 4 reveals the DCU's Justice League for the first time, but its showrunner has a warning for fans who might 'infer' anything from it","Creature Commandosepisode 4 has handed us a first look at the DC Cinematic Universe's (DCU) Justice League, but not in the way many would've predicted I didn't expect theMaxseries' fourth episode, titled 'Chasing Squirrels', to mark the supergroup's debut in James Gunn and Peter Safran's rebootedDCUniverse, but here we are. Well, I'm using the word 'debut' pretty liberally here, because they only show up in the briefest of scenes that showrunner Dean Lorey says you and I ""shouldn't infer"" anything from said sequence. Full spoilers immediately followforCreature Commandos' fourth chapter, so turn back now if you haven't streamed it yet. As I said, the scene in question isn't a full introduction to the DCU's Justice League. Seven minutes into 'Chasing Squirrels', ARGUS chief Amanda Waller is shown a vision of the future by Circe, the series' apparent villain-in-chief and who'sone of three big teases inCreature Commandosthat predate Wonder Woman's DCU debut. But I'm getting off track. Circe, who was captured by the eponymous team in one of thebest Max shows' fourth entry, attempts to tell Waller, Rick Flag Sr., and John Economos that Princess Ilana and Pokolistan, the nation she rules over, aren't what they seem. In a bid to convince them further, Circe says she can use her clairvoyant abilities on Waller to show her a vision of a potential future where Ilana and Pokolistan tyranically rule over the world. It's here where the Justice League appear – kind of, anyway. You see, as part of Waller's vision, we see the Justice League, plus numerous other DC heroes and antiheroes, crucified, impaled on spears, or lying dead on a skull-littered ground. Among those depicted in this sequence are DC's iconic trifecta of superheroes, akaBatman,Superman, andWonder Woman. They aren't the only ones, though. I also spotted Robin,Peacemaker,Supergirl, one of the Green Lantern Corps, Hawkgirl, Vigilante, and what appears to be a comics-accurateAquaman(complete with blonder hair) among the dead. Let me know if you picked out anyone else, such as The Flash, Cyborg, and Martian Manhunter. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There are plenty of questions raised by Circe's premonition. How powerful is the country of Pokolistan if it's able to not only conquer the world, but also defeat so many metahumans? Is this a future thatwillhappen or may only do so if Task Force M doesn't stop Ilana? And is there anything we should read into the Justice League and their fellow heroes' deaths in thisDCU Chapter Oneproject? Unfortunately, if you came here looking for answers to the above and any other queries you have, Lorey can only provide one answer, but it's a pretty categorical one all the same. ""That scene is specific to the story [ofCreature Commandos],"" Lorey replied when I asked him if it sets up future scenarios in the DCU. ""It's not really meant to infer anything but, you know, it was meant to do what it does, which is show a very dark vision of the world if something isn't done to prevent it. But, no, I would say fans shouldn't infer anything about the Justice League [from that]."" Consider that case closed, then!

48,Supporting business resiliency for all working policies,"With the news that several large corporations such asAmazonare insisting theiremployeesreturn to the office full time, it could be thought that the hybrid working revolution was merely a blip caused by lockdown necessity. It remains to be seen whether this reversion will be successful or whether it will cause another wider adjustment as employees seek the employment that best reflects their needs. Certainly, it should be seen as part of the continuum of an accelerating process of realignments as issues including trust, technology,productivity, creativity, family, finance and mental health shape the future of work. Co-founder of Inevidesk. Whether hybrid working remains a part of an organization's primary working strategy or not, it is critical that they retain the capability to do so to ensure business resiliency. The disruptions that impact physicalofficeattendance will continue to exist and may well increase as the world becomes more unpredictable. From severe weather events to social unrest and global political shifts, there are a plethora of problems which will undermine attempts to confidently forecast mid to long-term plans. The ability to flex as challenges and opportunities arise must be a fundamental consideration for all businesses. Developing an effective capability for remote and hybrid work enables employees to work from home or other locations if the office becomes inaccessible. Disregarding any other outcomes from recent years, this is a lesson that should not be forgotten. Adopting technologies will be key for businesses to achieve the level of business resiliency required to support all working policies. For example, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) supports remote and hybrid working and can also be leveraged to improve other aspects of business resiliency, security, scalability and efficiency. VDI situates PC orworkstationresources on a server, rather than a laptop or desk-based device. This enables resources to sit alongside other server-based services in a central location, whether that be an office server room, a data center or the cloud. Thevirtual desktopsare accessed with a low-spec device, often an inexpensive laptop or ‘thin client’, through an application or browser, over the network or internet. The experience for the end user remains the same so long as the service has been appropriately specified and configured, meaning employees can work from almost anywhere with an internet connection. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! To ensure greater business protection, VDI (and its related infrastructure) should be located in a high-end data center to guarantee additional levels of resiliency. These would generally include dual and diverse power and connectivity, backup power generators, high levels of environmental management and physical and network security (such asDDOS protection). Such measures are important to reduce the risk of downtime, whether your employees are working from home or the office. Public and private cloud vendors will offer this level of service as a rule. Centralizing all business resources also improves security. Data stays within a centrally managed network, rather than being located or replicated across multiple external devices, which exponentially increases vulnerability to attack. Employees only have inexpensive, dumb devices in hand, which are harder to hack and less problematic if stolen or damaged. Reducing the use ofVPNs, replication and edge device data reduces the attack surface considerably. Many VDI providers also offer scalability for organizations to flex their resources in line with their current needs. This type of dynamic resourcing is one of the big promises of cloud computing and is extremely attractive, especially when long-term forecasting is a challenge. There is a cost associated with such dynamism, but balancing this with less expensive, dedicated core resources allows for both reliability and agility. Perhaps the most under-appreciated aspect of VDI is the efficiency that it can introduce to computer estate management. Administering through web-based control panels enables IT administrators to manage everything remotely, regardless of where the end user is based. Virtual desktops can be spun up or disabled in minutes, creating huge savings in the time that would otherwise be spent on physical device deployments and decommissioning. Resources can be reallocated across machines, users quickly reassigned and fresh images deployed rapidly, simplifying office moves and reorganizations. There exists some understandable nervousness about hybrid working and VDI. For many organizations, this still seems a step too far from their long embedded and comfortable working practices and technologies. Alongside the recent push for a return to office working by some organizations, there has also been a parallel shift with other early adopters moving away from public cloud services; the latter primarily due to its expense and lack of ROI. Thankfully there are growing private cloud services that offer better and more accessible offerings, which ensure that the promise of cloud and VDI can still be realized. This will be important in the coming years which are sure to be full of new challenges and opportunities. We've listed the best free remote desktop software.

49,Search for alternative to WordPress surges worldwide amidst rift between WP-Engine and Matt Mullenweg,"Global search interest for WordPress alternatives has surged dramatically as the conflict between WP Engine and Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress and CEO of Automattic, intensifies Data fromGoogleTrends noted search requests around thewebsite builderboomed in October 2024, especially on October 8, where it reached a peak score of 100. The spike in interest signals a shift in user behavior, indicating an active search for options which align more closely with user expectations around performance, control, and transparency. Before October 8, Google Trends data shows the search interest for WordPress alternatives was essentially dormant, with no recorded searches from October 4 to October 7. Observers attribute this surge to the escalating legal and public disputes between WP Engine and Mullenweg, who accused WP Engine of trademark infringement and compromising WordPress’s open-source ethos. The contention centers on WP Engine’s handling of WordPress features, including limiting revision history for posts and its allegedly confusing use of the “WP” branding, which Mullenweg argues misleads users into believing WP Engine is directly affiliated with WordPress. The tension reached new heightswith Mullenweg calling WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress”. Both WP Engine and Automattic have since exchanged cease-and-desist letters, with WP Engine contesting Automattic’s claims, asserting its use of WordPress trademarks falls under fair use. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This back-and-forth intensified whenMullenweg blocked WP Engine’s accessto WordPress.org resources, including updates for plugins and themes but theban was liftedby judge based on the merits that WP Engine are likely to win their legal battle. WP Engine has also sued Automattic's CEO for attempted extortion. The companytoldTechRadar Pro: “...Matt Mullenweg’s conduct over the last ten days has exposed significant conflicts of interests and governance issues that, if left unchecked, threaten to destroy that trust. WP Engine has no choice but to pursue these claims to protect its people, agency partners, customers, and the broader WordPress community.” The data from October 4 to November 4, 2024 highlights a notable shift in user behaviour globally, with countries such as the United States, Canada, Germany, India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Brazil showing an increased interest in exploring WordPress alternatives.

Spanish National Police: Part of the human remains of the missing person have been found buried in a cemetery in a town in the province of Soria and advanced technical means had to be used to locate them.

52,Here are the best iPad deals right now,"While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini. It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips. Announced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less. The last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Amazon and Walmart are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi for $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, Amazon is selling it in silver for $449 ($30 off), which is $100 more than the lowest price to date. A last-gen model is still worth considering The last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard. Apple’s entry-level iPad from 2021 has a 10.2-inch screen, an A13 Bionic chip, and a 12MP front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature. It’s also compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the company’s smart keyboard. Although it’s discontinued, it’s the only iPad you can still buy with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Although the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack. In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon in select colors for an all-time low of $249.99 ($100 off) when you clip the on-page coupon. You can also find it at Best Buy and Walmart for $279 ($70 off), which is about $30 more than its lowest price to date. Amazon, Best Buy, and Target are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi starting at $429 ($70 off), which is about $20 more than its best price to date.  Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and home button. The new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, you can get the 128GB base configuration with Wi-Fi at Amazon for $479 ($20 off), which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage at Amazon and B&H Photo for $569 ($30 off), its second-best price to date, though Amazon currently does not provide a shipping estimate for the tablet. The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Apple just recently launched the 2024 iPad Air, which features several small upgrades. The newer model doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799. Deals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Best Buy and Target starting at $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy and Target for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off). The newest iPad Air comes with Apple’s M2 chip, a new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and last-gen Magic Keyboards. In addition to the 11-inch model, the newest iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M2 processor. It features a Liquid Retina display, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and the bigger version of Apple’s last-gen Magic Keyboard. Compared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call. As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo starting at $899 (about $100 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $1,099 ($200 off), which is an all-time low price. Apple’s latest iPad Pro is the first Apple device with an M4 processor and an OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR display. It also features an improved camera system with adaptive flash and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro and the newest Magic Keyboard. The newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor. Both models also feature an OLED display, a much thinner and lighter build, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.","Apple’s newest iPad Pro, which features an M4 chip, is on sale starting at $899 right now. | Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini . It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips. The best iPad (2021) deals Announced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued . The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less. The last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Amazon and Walmart are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi for $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, Amazon is selling it in silver for $449 ($30 off), which is $100 more than the lowest price to date. A last-gen model is still worth considering The last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage , a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard. The best iPad (2022) deals Although the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price ). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack. In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon in select colors for an all-time low of $249.99 ($100 off) when you clip the on-page coupon. You can also find it at Best Buy and Walmart for $279 ($70 off), which is about $30 more than its lowest price to date. Amazon , Best Buy , and Target are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi starting at $429 ($70 off), which is about $20 more than its best price to date. The best iPad Mini (2024) deals The new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, you can get the 128GB base configuration with Wi-Fi at Amazon for $479 ($20 off), which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage at Amazon and B&H Photo for $569 ($30 off), its second-best price to date, though Amazon currently does not provide a shipping estimate for the tablet. The best iPad Air (2024) deals Apple just recently launched the 2024 iPad Air , which features several small upgrades. The newer model doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards , too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799. Deals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Best Buy and Target starting at $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon , Best Buy and Target for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off). The best iPad Pro (2024) deals Compared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip , which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes.

53,The best phone to buy right now,"The AI phones are here, but that doesn’t mean they’ve really arrived. The year’s hottest trend is trickling down to mobile tech, but the results so far are a mixed bag, to say the least. Samsung and Google have a lot of AI tricks on their phones that don’t really amount to much yet, and Apple is catching up. AI really could be the start of helpful new ways to interact with our phones! But we’re definitely not there yet. In the meantime, be prepared to hear a lot more about AI on your next phone — and temper your expectations.  A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming. The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.  Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category. The very best devices come with robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.  In addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades. If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones. Apple’s baseline iPhone has a 6.1-inch screen, two rear cameras in a rearranged vertical layout, a customizable Action Button, and a new Camera Control button. It also supports Apple Intelligence, which has started rolling out throughout 2024, with further development continuing into 2025. Screen: 6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 From a hardware perspective, the iPhone 16 (or the 16 Plus) is an easy upgrade choice. If you’re switching from an iPhone 13, 12, or even older, those four or five years of incremental performance improvements add up. But there’s something entirely new this time around — well, two things: the Action Button and the Camera Control button.  The customizable Action Button, which replaces the mute switch on the left edge of the phone, is a hand-me-down from the 15 Pro series. You can set it to open a particular app, turn on the flashlight, or almost anything else you might want at the touch of a button. On the other side of the phone is the Camera Control, which you can use to launch the camera app. With the camera open, it acts as a shutter button with a full press, and a light press brings up other exposure options you can adjust. Even if you only ever use it to launch the camera, it’s pretty handy, and it frees up the Action Button.  The iPhone 16 and its larger 16 Plus sibling use Apple’s A18 chipset, which is in the same family as the 16 Pro’s processor. That bodes well for the phones staying on the same software upgrade cycle. They both received Apple Intelligence in the fall, which included AI-powered writing tools and notification summaries in its earliest iteration and eventually grew to support ChatGPT and a new Visual Intelligence feature. But despite the similarities, the regular 16 models lag behind the Pros in two important departments: the screen and the camera.  The Pros come with dedicated 5x lenses and updated main cameras that do a little better in low light. And you’ll only get a ProMotion display on the Pro models; the regular 16 features a slower 60Hz screen. Basically every other high-end phone on the market offers a 120Hz display, so that’s a disappointment. If those two drawbacks don’t bother you — and most people probably won’t mind them — then the iPhone 16 makes for a great upgrade. Google’s new Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display than its predecessor, along with a new Tensor G4 processor, a bigger battery, 12GB of RAM, and a dual rear camera setup with a new 48-megapixel sensor for its ultrawide. Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / Weather resistance: IP68 The Android ecosystem has been looking for a phone like the Pixel 9 for a while now. It’s straightforward and unfussy, takes reliably good photos, and comes with the polished hardware you’d expect from a high-end phone. It doesn’t have a dedicated telephoto lens, which the similarly priced Galaxy S24 does, but the software is less quirky than Samsung’s, making for a better overall experience. Outside of zoom capabilities, Google’s Pixel camera is just as reliable as ever. The phone comes with a Tensor G4 chipset that powers AI features aplenty, both inside and outside of the camera app. Some are promising and some are worrying, but there’s nothing here that feels like a true game-changer. Which is fine.  The important thing is that the Pixel 9 has the right stuff where it counts. It’s easy to use, and some of the Pixel series’ persistent problems like poor thermals and buggy software seem to be under control in this generation. The 9 Pro is a worthwhile upgrade if you want that telephoto lens and a slightly nicer screen, but in any case, the Pixel 9 feels like a top-notch device, inside and out. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is just loaded with goodies, including a big, beautiful display, an integrated stylus, and two telephoto cameras. Read our review. Screen: 6.8-inch, 1440p, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68 Samsung’s maximalist S-series Ultra phone sort of exists in its own stratosphere. Where else are you going to find a phone with four rear cameras and a built-in stylus? The S24 Ultra remains an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink phone, and even though it’s every bit as feature-packed as last year’s model, it feels just a little less special than the S23 Ultra did. The aforementioned Galaxy AI features are here, of course, but they’re nothing to write home about just yet, and they’re available on the S23 series, too. The S24 Ultra’s starting price went up, too — now $1,299 rather than $1,199. And the optical 10x zoom lens is gone, replaced by a 5x zoom with more megapixels and in-sensor cropping to get to 10x. It’s mostly fine, but man, there was something cool about a true 10x zoom on a phone. All that said, the S24 Ultra can’t be beat if you’re looking for the very best Android phone — cost and size be damned. The 6.8-inch display now comes with anti-glare treatment that does a fantastic job of cutting reflections and keeping the screen comfortable to use outdoors. The phone handles heavy processing tasks without a problem, and the camera system is usually good and occasionally brilliant, especially with 3x portrait mode photos. And there’s an S Pen! Have you ever seen a fancier way to make a to-do list? Ultra devotees likely won’t have a problem stomaching the price hike this year thanks in no small part to Samsung’s generous trade-in deals. For everyone else, it’s best to think of the S24 Ultra like any other pricey gadget — a beautiful, splurge-worthy device if nothing but the absolute best will make you happy. Google’s latest midranger touts a whopping seven years of software support and a number of small upgrades, including Google’s speedy Tensor G3 processor, a 120Hz display, and plenty of new AI features. Screen: 6.1-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G3 Cameras: 64-megapixel f/1.89 with OIS; 13-megapixel ultrawide; 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,492mAh / Charging: 18W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP67 It’s hard to beat the Pixel 8A on sheer ROI. For $500, you get a very good budget phone that comes with seven years of OS and security updates; most phones at this price will only see a handful of OS upgrades, if that. The 8A also comes with a good camera that covers the basics. It’s not as fancy as the Pixel 9 or 9 Pro, but it won’t prevent you from capturing that once-in-a-lifetime shot.  The Pixel 8A provides a lot of other things you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a $500 phone, like wireless charging and an IP67 rating for resistance against full water immersion. Of course, you can’t have everything. The 8A’s back panel is matte plastic rather than glass, sadly, and its 6.1-inch 1080p screen isn’t the best in its class (see the OnePlus 12R). There are other phones available for under $500 worth considering, many of which are covered in our guide to the best inexpensive phones. But if you’re looking for the absolute most value you can get from a $500 phone, then look no further than the 8A. The iPhone 16 Pro sports a new 6.3-inch OLED panel with 120Hz refresh, all of which is powered by a new A18 Pro chip. Its triple camera array features a higher-res 48MP sensor for its ultrawide lens, and there’s a new physical Camera Control button for taking pictures and operating the camera app. Screen: 6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Pro Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 Like all four iPhone 16 models, the 16 Pro gained the new Camera Control, but it got another important update, too: a 5x telephoto lens. In the 15 series, that longer telephoto lens was reserved for the bigger Pro Max model. This time around, it’s on the smaller Pro, too, making it a great option for someone who wants to upgrade without upsizing their phone.  Like the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro uses an A18 Pro chipset designed to support Apple Intelligence, which started rolling out in the fall of 2024. The first update included things like notification summaries and the new glowing-border Siri UI, which Apple centered its launch event on. Subsequent updates brought ChatGPT integration and Visual Intelligence. But don’t expect anything radical — at least at first. Outside of AI, the 16 Pro is a fairly iterative update. The new Camera Control makes it easier to launch the camera and get right to taking photos, and it also frees up the Action Button if you were using it as a camera shortcut. The screen is a little bigger at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is basically the same size. You can record 4K video at 120fps now. And the new Photographic Styles, which are available on all iPhone 16 models, let you take more control over your photos than ever. There’s nothing here that someone with an iPhone 15 Pro should upgrade for, but it’s an all-around solid device that will please Apple devotees, especially those who prefer a phone that isn’t too big. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers slight design and performance upgrades compared to the previous generation. The AI-ready Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 now comes with 12GB of RAM and a vapor chamber for cooling. It also has a new 50-megapixel camera sensor that enables 2X optical zoom. Read our review. Screen: 6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 3.4-inch, 720p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP48 The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn’t the most fun flip phone you can buy right now; that would be the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus. But fun only goes so far, and the Z Flip 6 is the more reliable device of the two. When it comes to the device you use day in and day out, reliability counts for a lot. Motorola’s take on the modern flip phone embraces nostalgia with cute animations and a mode that sends the whole device back to the early 2000s. The Z Flip 6 lacks this kind of charm, but you do get an updated cover screen UI that’s more customizable than the Z Flip 5’s. The Flip 6 also comes with seven years of software updates, which matches the best software policies on the market. The hardware will probably give out long before the software, honestly. That’s the other side of the flip phone coin: long-term durability is iffy. Sure, the Flip 6 is built to withstand full water immersion, but it still doesn’t have any formal dust resistance. For that reason, it isn’t a phone I would recommend to just anyone. That said, the Z Flip 6’s outer screen does come in handy. You can do a lot with the prebaked widget options available to use, and if you’re just a little adventurous, you can run any app you want on the little screen. Starting a Strava workout or sending a quick text is a cinch, which is a big part of the appeal of a flip phone. Just, you know, keep this phone away from the beach. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an eight-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold. The new foldable also lays flat when opened, sports IPX8 weather resistance, and offers a thinner design than the last-gen model. Read our review. Screen: 8.0-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.3-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8 It’s hard to convey just how nice the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is to use. It’s the first book-style folding phone that fully delivers on the promise of a foldable: it’s a tablet when you need it and a regular phone when you don’t. Samsung’s Z Fold series feels a little too narrow and cramped in its closed configuration, and the original Pixel Fold was too bulky and heavy to use comfortably. The 9 Pro Fold is lighter, and using its 6.3-inch outer screen feels basically like using a normal phone, which is a big win. That’s really the theme of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold: it just feels normal. But there are a couple of decidedly not-normal things to consider: price and durability. The 9 Pro Fold costs $1,799 — basically the going rate for a book-style foldable but still a lot of money for a phone. And long-term durability is unclear, especially given that this is only Google’s second folding phone. It’s rated to withstand full water immersion, but as with any foldable, dust is a concern, so you’ll want to take a little extra care with this device. All that said, someone with the stomach (and wallet) for the 9 Pro Fold will find it a very rewarding device. The Nothing Phone 2 embraces a certain retro-infused aesthetic that’s unlike anything else you’ll find on the market. It’s not certified to work on Verizon, and its rear-panel LED light strips are more stylish than functional, but it’s a good alternative to the big Android brands. Screen: 6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 / Cameras: 50-megapixel F/1.9 main with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP54 The Nothing Phone 2 isn’t for everyone, but for the right kind of person, it’s a very good alternative to the Galaxies and Pixels of the world. It’s a style-driven device, from the dot-matrix-inspired UI to the flashing light strips on the back panel. Will its unique hardware and software features help you take back your attention span as Nothing claims? Eh, probably not. Mostly, it’s just a cool-looking gadget and a thoughtfully designed device. The Phone 2 is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset, which is a slightly older but still very capable processor. Its 6.7-inch, 1080p screen supports a fast 120Hz top refresh rate, and its lowest 1Hz refresh rate allows it to offer an information-rich always-on display. The camera system is good, though not quite as consistent as the Pixel 7’s. There’s wireless charging, fast 45W wired charging, and an all-day battery. That’s all of the good news. The bad news is that it’s only rated IP54, meaning it’s not fully dustproof, and it’s only resistant to splashes rather than full immersion in water. Most other phones at this price offer a full IP68 rating, and a couple of cheaper midrange phones, like the Pixel 8A, still include IP67 water resistance. The Phone 2 also lacks official support for Verizon’s network, which rules it out for a lot of people in the US. There’s the Glyph Interface, too — those lights on the back of the phone. It’s a neat idea with some interesting applications if you invest a little time in tweaking it. You can flip it over to silence notifications when you need some time to focus and handpick certain “essential” alerts to light up the Glyph. Personally, I find it less helpful than a traditional focus mode or even the Phone 2’s always-on display. But others might find it useful, and if nothing else, it looks neat.  The Phone 2 isn’t the best choice for sheer value — the Pixel 8A is a much better deal. It’s not the best choice for someone who just wants a phone to get them through their day with minimal hassle. But it’s undeniably different, and if you’re looking for something outside of the ordinary with a certain visual appeal, then it’s a worthy candidate.

54,Dune: Prophecy is getting a second season on HBO,"The first season of Dune: Prophecy is about to wrap up — but there’s more on the way. Ahead of the finale on December 22nd, HBO has confirmed than the prequel series has been renewed for a second season. The show premiered in November, and takes place 10,000 years before the events of the Dune movies from Denis Villeneuve. It stars Emily Watson and Olivia Williams as two Harkonnen sisters who form the galaxy-defining sect known as the Bene Gesserit. “If you just know the Harkonnens from the movies, they’re these monstrous villains who are very clearly the bad guys,” showrunner Alison Schapker told The Verge about the series. “But that’s not where they started off, and this kind of story gave us a chance to complicate that understanding and dig into what made them that way.” There’s no word on when to expect season 2, but it’s also not the only Dune project on the way: Dune 3 is in the works, as is a survival game set on Arrakkis.","Image: HBO The first season of Dune: Prophecy is about to wrap up — but there’s more on the way.

55,Google Keep might be joining the ranks of Android system apps,"Google Keep is being upgraded to a system app on Android 16 devices, joining the ranks of other Android apps that provide essential services like calling and messaging, reports Android Police.

Anyone upgrading to this OS version will no longer be able to uninstall the app unless they have root access.

56,Home Assistant’s new voice assistant answers to ‘Hey Jarvis’,"There’s a new voice assistant in town, and this one can work locally in your home without phoning home to its corporate overloads. This week, the popular hobbyist smart home platform Home Assistant officially launched its first voice assistant hardware — Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition. Built for the open-source smart home platform, Voice PE costs $59 and brings a locally controlled, privacy-focused voice assistant to Home Assistant in a plug-and-play package. Once connected to Home Assistant, you can use voice to control any connected device, with commands such as “Turn on the living room lights,” “Lock all the doors,” “Create a timer for 5 minutes,” and many more. While Home Assistant users have been able to control their smart homes with voice using either Home Assistant’s Assist on less capable third-party hardware or through the cloud by connecting to third-party services like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, this is the first dedicated Home Assistant voice hardware product.  Voice PE is the culmination of Home Assistant’s Year of the Voice, an effort from Nabu Casa, the organization behind Home Assistant, to let users control their homes locally, privately, and in their own language. It currently supports over 50 languages, compared to eight for Alexa and 20 for Google Assistant. The Voice PE is a small white box, about the size of your palm, with dual microphones and an audio processor. An internal speaker lets you hear the assistant, but you can also connect a speaker to it via a 3.5 mm headphone jack for better-quality media playback.  Out of the box, you can talk to Assist with the wake words “Okay Nabu,” “Hey Jarvis,” or “Hey Mycroft.”  A colored LED ring on top of the Voice PE indicates when the assistant is listening. It surrounds a rotary dial and a physical button, which is used for setup and to talk to the voice assistant without using the wake word. The button can also be customized to do whatever you want (because this is Home Assistant). A physical mute switch is on the side, and the device is powered by USB-C (charger and cable not included). There’s also a Grove port where you can add sensors and other accessories. Speaking of wake words, out of the box, you can talk to Assist with the wake words “Okay Nabu,” “Hey Jarvis,” or “Hey Mycroft.” If you want to get fancy, you can program a custom wake word.  The assistant can run locally in your home without an internet connection on Home Assistant hardware (such as the Home Assistant Green hub), or it can use the Home Assistant cloud. According to Nabu Casa, the latter is faster and supports more languages. The company says your data is not stored on the cloud nor used for training. 1/7 1/7 For those who don’t like the idea of always-listening microphones in their home from companies such as Amazon and Google, but who still want the convenience of controlling their home with their voice, the potential here is huge. But it may be a while until Voice PE is ready to replace your Echo or Nest smart speaker.  The Verge’s Callie Wright, a Home Assistant superuser, has been testing the Voice PE for a few weeks. While they are impressed with its capabilities (although it had some trouble understanding them when there was background noise), they aren’t quite ready to kick Alexa to the curb. “I think Amazon’s Alexa is still worth the privacy tradeoffs for me just because there are key things for me that Voice PE can’t pull off,” they say. “But the progress Home Assistant has made in its Year of the Voice has been incredible, and I’m more hopeful than ever that that future is coming.”  While the intention is to surpass “Big Tech voice assistants,” Paulus Schoutsen, founder of Home Assistant, recognizes it’s not there yet. Hence, Voice is launching as a Preview Edition. “For some, the current capabilities of our voice assistant will be all they need, especially those who just want to set timers, manage their shopping list, and control their most used devices,” says Schoutsen. “For others, we understand they want to ask their voice assistant to make whale sounds or to tell them how tall Taylor Swift is — our voice assistant doesn’t do those things… yet.” In the meantime, if you want more features, Voice PE can connect to supported AI models, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, to fully replace Assist or use it as a fallback for commands it doesn’t understand. But for many smart home users, there will be plenty of value in a simple, inexpensive device that lets you turn your lights on and off, start a timer, and execute other useful commands with your voice without relying on an internet connection.","The Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition is the first hardware from the open-source smart home platform that’s designed for voice control. | Image: Nabu Casa There’s a new voice assistant in town, and this one can work locally in your home without phoning home to its corporate overloads.

57,Thousands of Amazon delivery drivers at seven hubs are on strike,"Thousands of delivery drivers who work for Amazon third-party contractors are now on strike, The New York Times reports. The workers are striking after “Amazon’s repeated refusal to follow the law and bargain with the thousands of Amazon workers who organized with the Teamsters,” according to a Teamsters press release. Workers are picketing at Amazon warehouses from Atlanta, New York City, San Francisco, Southern California, and Skokie, Ill., with other Amazon Teamsters “prepared to join them,” the Teamsters say. “Teamsters local unions are also putting up primary picket lines at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide.” The National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Amazon earlier this year, saying that Amazon and one of its third-party contractors are joint employers of delivery drivers and that it has “a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters Union,” per another Teamsters press release. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel shared the following statement with New York City’s WPIX and with The Verge: For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent ‘thousands of Amazon employees and drivers’. They don’t, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative. The truth is that the Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated, and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal and is the subject of multiple pending unfair labor practice charges against the union. Amazon employees who have organized with the Teamsters voted last week to authorize a strike.

58,How to reshare Threads posts without quote posting,"In what seems to be a battle between Threads and Bluesky for the hearts and minds of ex-Twitterers, Threads has been adding some interesting new features. The latest is the ability to share photos and videos without including the original post — in other words, without quote posting. (There’s a similar feature in X for videos.) There has been some initial pushback on it. A photographer on Threads complained that “there will be a small watermark-like credit on the photo, but there won’t be a link back to your account.” Curious, I tried out the new feature, went to see if there was indeed no link back to the original post, and followed bryanhansel’s instructions for turning it off. Here’s what happened, and how you can use and adjust Threads’ new feature. (All of these instructions have been followed using the mobile app.) The new post will indeed have the image with only your comment and without the previous comment. However, the original poster’s name will appear as a watermark in the upper-left corner and the number of reposts will appear in the lower-left corner. While it isn’t an obvious feature, there is a link to the original post. When I tapped on the watermark, the original post — text and all — appeared directly above my repost. However, if you prefer that any images or videos you post be shared along with your original text only, you can do that. (Again, instructions courtesy of bryanhansel.) And that’s it. Now, all we have to do is wait for the next entry in the features war between Threads and Bluesky.","Image: The Verge In what seems to be a battle between Threads and Bluesky for the hearts and minds of ex-Twitterers, Threads has been adding some interesting new features.

59,Google reveals AI ‘reasoning’ model that ‘explicitly shows its thoughts’,"Google has introduced a new AI “reasoning” model capable of answering complex questions while also providing a rundown of its “thoughts,” as reported earlier by TechCrunch. The model, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, is still experimental and will likely compete with OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model. In a post on X, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean says the model is “trained to use thoughts to strengthen its reasoning,” and also benefits from the speed that comes along with the faster Gemini Flash 2.0 model. The demo shared by Dean shows how Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking goes about answering a physics problem by “thinking” through a series of steps before offering a solution.  This isn’t necessarily “reasoning” in the way humans perform it, but it means the machine breaks down instructions into smaller tasks that can produce stronger outcomes. Another example, posted by Google product lead Logan Kilpatrick, shows the model reasoning its way through a problem that involves both visual and textual elements. “This is just the first step in our reasoning journey,” Kilpatrick says. You can try out Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking on Google’s AI Studio. There have been quite a few notable updates in the AI space as of late, with Google revealing its upgraded Gemini 2.0 model earlier this month as part of the company’s push into “agentic” AI. Meanwhile, OpenAI made the full version of its o1 reasoning model available to ChatGPT subscribers.","Illustration: The Verge Google has introduced a new AI “reasoning” model capable of answering complex questions while also providing a rundown of its “thoughts,” as reported earlier by TechCrunch .

80,Doctor Who‘s Christmas Special Has Its Cake and Eats It,"ReturningDoctor Whoshowrunner Russell T. Davies might have pioneered modernDoctor Whoholiday specials—Christmassy monsters, high spectacle, an occasional amount of Kylie Minogue—but it’s arguable that it was his successor, Steven Moffat, that really nailed the balancing act of what a goodDoctor WhoChristmas story should be. The answer, paradoxically, is not really a great sci-fi story all that much—or at least, that’s not as important as a swath of earnest, almost cloying sentimentality about the romance of the season. This year’s offering, Moffat’sfirst Christmas scriptsince 2017’s Twelfth Doctor send off “Twice Upon a Time,” mostly succeeds in that balancing act with an interestingly time-twistingDoctor Whoadventure festooned with festive charm—one that really leans on the latter to help make up for a few missteps in the former. “Joy to the World,” airing next week on Christmas Day, has a few parallels to Ncuti Gatwa’s full-fledged debut as the 15th Doctor inlast year’s holiday episode, “The Church on Ruby Road,” in so much that it relies on an array of charming performances to try and mask when its story doesn’t quite cohesively come together. It trades the fantastical bent of creepy baby-snatching goblins for more traditional sci-fi aesthetics as the Doctor shacks up in a futuristic “Time Hotel” for the holidays, offering temporal gateways to Christmases across human history. It also leansheavyon that seasonal aesthetic too, with plenty of snow, tinsel, and trees, feeling much more of the season rather than simply being any old episode that happens to air near the end of December. Intrigued by the mystery of a strange suitcase that seems to be fatally swapping between hosts at the hotel, it is in thisfestively timey-wimey scenario—and via the Time Hotel’s aforementioned gateways—that the Doctor crosses paths withthe lonely Joy(Nicola Coughlan), as she checks into a run-down hotel in London during Christmas 2024. The mystery of why Joy becomes so important to the Doctor’s latest adventure is actually put aside for a good chunk of “Joy to the World” as it takes a sideways step into exploring the ramifications of the Time Hotels’ gateways, and the temporal paradoxes that come with them. It’s all perfectly Moffat-y, a blend of laughs, time-twisting story telling, and the almost mandatory melancholy that comes with his best outings as a writer, as the Doctor finds himself thrust into the life of another lonely woman along the way (Steph de Whalley’s Anita, perhaps secretly the breakout star of “Joy to the World”). It’s a killerDoctor Whostory idea, one that also deftly touches on the Doctor’s own loneliness afterparting ways with Ruby. It just so happens to be appropriately seasonally stuffed inside anotherDoctor Whoepisode that is… well, not quite given the time to breathe into something as interesting. “Joy to the World” makes up for those structural shortcomings with Joy’s storyline by really allowing that element of the episode to be where it goes all out on the sentimentality of the festive season, with a climactic narrative high on heart-tugging emotional drama to make up for the fact that it’s playing a bit fast and loose with the logistical underpinnings, especially contrasted with the plot-within-a-plot the first half of the episode of is devoted to. For the most part it works, thanks to stellar performances from Gatwa and Coughlan, and will particularly strike a bittersweet chord for people going through Christmas without loved ones. But if you find yourself particularly immune toDoctor Who‘s sentimental charm offensives at this time of year, you might find the culmination of it all a little wanting—and wondering just how the episode might have been if it stayed with that initial plot-within-a-plot as its main idea. But even if you don’t find yourself resonating with the emotion of it all, there’s still at the very least a good chunk of greatDoctor Whoto be found in “Joy to the World,” even if it’s not the ultimate focus of the episode. There’s enough here to satisfy either anyone looking for a greatDoctor Whoidea, or someone who just wants something big and Christmassy to swell their heart with seasonal spirit as they sit down with over the festive period—and at this point inDoctor Who‘s long history of holiday specials, that we can still get stories that manage to balance both is a welcome little gift under our collective trees. Doctor Whoreturns to Disney+ around the world and on the BBC in the UK and Ireland on Christmas Day, December 25. Want more io9 news?

81,One Piece‘s Creator Tells Netflix’s Luffy Why the Hero Is So Special,"It’s not every day that an actor in a successful live action anime project gets to sit down and interview its creator in their native tongue, but Netflix’sOne Piecestar Iñaki Godoy did just that ahead of the show’ssecond season. In a recent video from Netflix’sStill Watching YouTube Channel, Monkey D. Luffy actor Godoy sat down withEiichiro Odaon the set ofOne Piece’sCape Town location in South Africa to discusswhat lies aheadon the Grand Line in season two, and how Luffy became a beloved character. “I got to see some actual filming, and especially the props, massive sets, special effects, the making of the wigs and costumes, the stunts,” Oda said. ” I saw so many things and was truly touched by everyone’s dedication.” When Godoy giddily asked Oda if he thought the acting was good, Oda responded in kind saying, “It was.” Naturally, Godoy exploded in infectious giggles, making Oda chuckle in return. Godoy’s subsequent question, posed in remarkably fluent Japanese despite only beginning to learn the language in January, inquired of Oda why he made the events in season two so challenging to adapt, given that the Straw Hat’s first season was already an immense undertaking. Another question, mind you, that made Oda chuckle when Godoy remarked on how “huge and crazy” their adventure was before making it to the Grand Line. “It’s tough. I’m very tired,” Godoy said. “In that universe, the Grand Line is the harshest of the seas. We need to shock audiences. That’s why there are giants, and, of course, lots of bounty hunters,” Oda replied, teasing the adventures that lie in wait in the upcoming season. “This needs to be a season full of new, surprising elements. That’s why it’s more challenging.” Godoy’s final question asked Oda how he came up with Luffy and made him such a depth-filled and endearing character, despite seeming like a simple fellow upon first blush. “Luffy is an ideal child for me. When you become an adult and join a company, you can’t always do what you want. Entering society often means losing freedom. Luffy has a child’s heart, so he does whatever he wants,” Oda said. “That aspect is probably, for adults already toiling in society, and to children about to enter society, what makes Luffy so appealing.” Oda wasn’t remiss in throwing a compliment Godoy’s way congratulating him on bringing Luffy to life and energizing audiences worldwide. The two then share a loving embrace. It’s very sweet. Alongside Godoy, returning cast members on the voyage of Netflix’sOne Piecelive-action series include Mackenyu as Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero as Usopp, Taz Skylar as Sanji, Ilia Isorelys Paulino as Alvida, Jeff Ward as Buggy, and Michael Dorman as Gold Roger. One Piece‘s second season will also see a crop of new faces from the anime make the jump to live action. Key among the new faces along the journey (and the actors who will be bringing them to life) are: Maintaining their usual secrecy, Netflix and Tomorrow Studios have not yet disclosed the actor who will bring the Straw Hat pirates’ doctor, Tony Tony Chopper, to live. All we’ve seen of the hard working reindeer is a shot of him from behind, confirming—to some fans’ dismay—that he won’t be a muppet but a little CGI dude. Hopefully the nextOne Piecesit-down (or teaser trailer) will show off Chopper in all of his cute glory. Inio9’s reviewof season one, we lauded the Netflix show for not requiring viewers to have invested in the anime to appreciate it, writing, “The show was clean. It was slick. Everything fit together, and at the end of the season, despite Luffy yelling again, I wanted a second season.” In tandem with a second live-action season, Netflix also has plans in motion for a remake of the anime, titledThe One Piece, animated by WIT Studio. In short, now’s as good a time as any to get intoOne Piece—be it through the manga, live action show, the ongoing anime, or its upcoming remake. Want more io9 news?

83,The Creator of Shudder’s New Christmas Anthology on Spooky Holiday Traditions,"If you’ve been creeping aroundShudderlooking for something to add a little fright to your seasonal viewing, you might have noticedThe Haunted Season—a brand new anthology series from showrunner Kier-La Janisse,a genre expertwhose many works include standout film-theory bookHouse of Psychotic Womenand recent folk-horror documentaryWoodlands Dark and Days Bewitched. The first entry,To Fire You Come at Last, is written and directed by Sean Hogan; it’s about a group of men carrying a coffin to be buried who’re haunted (literally) by past misdeeds while making the journey. To learn more aboutThe Haunted Season, which will bring one new entry to Shudder over the next several years, we talked with Janisse over video chat. Cheryl Eddy, io9: I have read your bookYuletide Terror: Christmas Horror on Film and Television, which gives a wonderful history of the genre and the traditions behind it. But for people who might not have read it, I’ll borrow one of the chapter titles and ask: “Why the ghost story at Christmas”? Kier-La Janisse:It’s interesting because Derek Johnston, who wrote that chapter, years ago wrote a book calledHaunted Seasons, which my title is completely ripped from [laughs]. When I was doing theYuletide Terrorbook, there’s hundreds of films in it, but most of them are very obviously connected to Christmas in some way. They’re either about Christmas or they take place at Christmas, or there’s visible Christmas decorations so that you could justify it as a Christmas movie. But a lot of the BBC’sA Ghost Story for Christmas[episodes] of the 1970s had nothing to do with Christmas. And so when I was including them in the book, I thought, North American audiences are not going to understand why these films are here because they’re like, “What do they have to do with Christmas?” I asked Derek if he would write a chapter talking about where this tradition comes from, of telling ghost stories of Christmas and the idea of Christmas programming—not necessarily the programming itself, but the fact that it’s chosen to be programmed at that time. It goes back centuries—it comes from the older tradition of telling winter’s tales. [When] people gathered around the hearth or around the fire, and they would come up with entertainment to pass the time while they were trying to keep warm. Winter’s tales were what they were called because they’d be these spooky tales that they would tell [when] the days are so short and [the season is] turning over into a new year. There’s this idea of liminal boundaries between one state of being and another. They would tell these ghost stories and then over time, once we started having written literature, you would start to see references to them in [places like the works of] Shakespeare and Marlowe. Then of course in the Victorian era, you have Charles Dickens’A Christmas Carol, which was massively important, not only for the idea of the Christmas ghost story, but just for Christmas in general. It was part of Queen Victoria’s mandate to repopularize Christmas. Charles Dickens writing that story when he did was a big part of not only cementing this idea that Christmas is the time when we tell ghost stories, but that this is the time of year we have Christmas—because before Queen Victoria, it had kind of fallen out as a popular holiday.A Christmas Carolbecame important for creating a lot of these ideas and mythologies we have around Christmas—Christmas tree decorations and all these accouterments that we associate with Christmas that came from that period. The ghost story for Christmas came to be associated very strongly with that period—an also, there weresomanyghost story writers in the Victorian era … there’s just tons and tons of them. And so when radio came in, they started doing radio adaptations ofA Christmas Caroland other types of ghost stories around the holiday. Then, that transformed into television. So the BBC was kind of always active and doing ghost stories for Christmas in some form or another. In the 1970s, Lawrence Gordon Clark, who was a director, proposed this idea of—he didn’t foresee it being a series. He proposed one film doing an adaptation of M.R. James’ storyThe Stalls of Barchester. He used a previous adaptation of an M.R. James story as proof that this could be popular; Jonathan Miller had made an adaptation calledWhistle and I’ll Come to Youin the late ‘60s, which is fantastic. And it was not made for Christmas. It was made for a different time of year, a different program. But Lawrence Gordon Clark took that to them and said, “Look how good this is, and imagine if we could do something like this for Christmas.” So he madeThe Stalls of Barchester. It was a big hit, so then he got permission every year to keep making another one. And so it became a series; all through the ‘70s, there would be a different episode. And so that is what my seriesThe Haunted Seasonis based on—this idea of an annual ghost story film that premieres every year. And I know for North American audiences, using the word “series” to describe something that only has one episode for a year is weird, but it is based on that tradition. It’s basically a Christmas special that’s ongoing, where there’s a new installment every year. That tradition still exists in the UK. So this series is just part of that bigger tradition. io9: How did you decide onTo Fire You Come at Lastas the first entry? How did writer-director Sean Hogan get involved? Janisse:Sean Hogan is a filmmaker, a writer of books, a playwright—he does all kinds of all kinds of things. He’s incredibly talented, really great with period dialogue. And so I proposed to him—and he can do a lot with a little, which is important because we have very low budgets for these things—if he would make a short film originally for Severin Films’ folk horror box set. We were doing our new box set,All the Haunts Be Ours Volume Two. The first box set had my documentary [Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched] on it—it had a new film on it. And we were like, “We don’t have an equivalent of that for the second box set.” So we asked Sean if he would make a film for that. I gave him a couple of prompts for it. The idea of it being set on a corpse road was something that came from one of the prompts that I gave him. But before he even finished the film, I sort of flashed back to this idea that Sam Zimmerman from Shudder and I had over a decade ago when we used to work together for Fangoria magazine. Back then we were trying to get Fangoria to do a ghost story for Christmas that we could premiere on the website, and the publisher wouldn’t go for it. But we had wanted Sean Hogan to make that film. So when Sean was making this film for me, before he was even done, I said to [Severin Films’] David Gregory, “What if we can pitch this to Shudder about being part of an ongoing series of ghost stories for Christmas?” And David was like, “Sure, go for it.” And so Sam and I had a conversation, and it was amazing because it was this idea that we had that was not approved years and years ago. We were so excited about it, like, “Let’s do it now!” And so that was really how it happened. It was in some ways a very long-gestating project, but then it just was like everything clicked, where it was like, all of this could actually work, you know? I’m just super glad that Sean Hogan made the first one because he was the filmmaker we were talking about doing the Fangoria one all those years ago. I love the film. It turned out so well. He made it with a small team in the UK and—you can’t tell from watching the film, but it was freezing and raining while they were making it. They were in very adverse conditions, but I think it turned out really well. io9:To Fire You Come at Lastis very traditional, very much in the style of the older films. Is that something we’ll be seeing as the series continues? Janisse:I don’t know that they’ll be in black and white, but they will all be period. They won’t necessarily be that same period, but they are supposed to engage with the past in some way. The guidelines that I’ve given the filmmakers is that definitely nothing after, like, 1960. You can go back to the Middle Ages if you want, or you can go up to the ‘50s, you know, but it has to feel [like a period piece]. That was what the tradition always was. It’s interesting, whenA Ghost Story for Christmasfirst played in the ‘70s, the last two episodes, they made modern stories—they did not adapt like older Victorian ghost stories. They made new stories, modern stories set in modern settings. And the audience at the time revolted—a lot of them got bad reviews. Now people love those episodes because now they’re vintage, now they’re period pieces. But at the time when they were new, people were like, “You’re ruining the tradition!” So I decided that I was going to keep the parameters. It’s [a pretty broad time frame], but they will still be period pieces of some sort. io9: Can you tease anything about any of the other entries? Janisse:The only thing I can tease is that I’m doing one of them [as my first narrative film].I have asked other people, they’re writing their scripts now—I’ll tease [more] when the time gets closer. io9: I am a big fan ofWoodlands Dark and Days Bewitched, your folk horror documentary. Are these Christmas ghost stories part of the folk horror tradition? Janisse:It definitely crosses over because of that oral tradition aspect of it. Like a lot of the BBC ghost stories for Christmas, you probably call them more like gothic horror than folklore, but it depends. Something likeA Warning to the CuriousandWhistle and I’ll Come to Youyou could call folklore because they’re definitely digging up an artifact from the past that is carrying all this baggage with it. There’s definitely folk horror elements to some of them, but some of them are definitely more in the gothic realm. But I think that Christmas ghost stories, just because of the fact that they’re tied to this oral tradition, that makes it a bit more connected to folklore. io9: And you’ve mentioned a couple of titles, but for people who watch the first episode ofThe Haunted Seasonand want to see more in that vein, what do you recommend they seek out? Janisse:Well, Shudder has licensed Jonathan Miller’sWhistle and I’ll Come to You. Absolutely start with that. And they’ve licensed Lawrence Gordon Clark’sA Ghost Story for Christmasfrom the 1970s. Those are the ones that my series is referencing, so I would recommend taking in all of those—there’s like nine different choices of what they can watch. I don’t know if they haveThe Stone Tapeon Shudder [editor’s note: they do!] butThe Stone Tapewas broadcast for Christmas. It doesn’t have anything to do with Christmas, but it was broadcast as part of the Christmas programing, as a Christmas ghost story. And that’s a great one, too.

85,Apollo Landing Keypad Shrunken Into World’s Coolest Calculator Watch,"Surely you’ve heard that your smartphone has more computing power than the computers that sent the Apollo mission to the Moon. Well, a full 55 years after the spaceflight that landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface, a company has managed to shrink down the Apollo computer in another way. British startupApollo Instrumentscreated a wristwatch that replicates theApollo Guidance Computer. The DSKY (short for “Display and Keyboard”) Moonwatch, shares the same interface as the briefcase-sized computers that were on board the Apollo program modules. The creators involved in the project tapped the original design specs from the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory to shrink down the panel and create a wearable replica. The original AGCs were used by astronauts for guidance and navigation, which you cannot do with the watch—and no offense, but you probably don’t have a spacecraft anyway. But it does function in its own way. The watch has a built-in GPS, a digital display, and a working keyboard. It’s also programmable, built atop an open-source framework that is compatible with a number of coding environments including Arduino and Python. So if you have some features you’d like to run, it’s open to input. The watch also has an 8-channel digital I/O port, which opens up the possibility of using the watch to control or interact with “breadboard interfaces, development enclosures, and robotic device,” per Apollo Instruments’ product description. The company said it will push out software updates in the future and work with community contributions, so if someone else comes up with a cool feature, you should be able to install it on your own device. Ultimately, the DSKY Moonwatch is a novelty. And priced at £649 (about $812), it’s not exactly a cheap one. But it at least brings a fun interface and the potential to expand functionality in unique ways. Sure, it’s not going to bring you all of the features of your standard smartwatch, and it’s not going to turn heads for the same reasons as a pricey timepiece. But at a minimum, it’s probably the only cool calculator watch and a decent conversation starter. So that’s something. The DSKY Moonwatch can bepre-ordered from Apollo Instrumentswith a £240 ($300) deposit. The company says it expects to start shipping the final product in the first quarter of 2025. And, just for your own safety, familiarize yourself with thepotential risks of contributing to crowdfunding campaignsbefore jumping in.",A British startup managed to shrink the Apollo Guidance Computer down to the size of an Apple Watch.,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/apollo-landing-keypad-shrunken-into-worlds-coolest-calculator-watch-2000541103,
86,"Dan Da Dan Is a Lovey-Dovey, Madcap Sci-Fi Anime Drama About Finding Your Balls","Anime adaptations often follow one of two paths. They are either a strict recreation of the manga, rigidly focused on directly transferring panels to the screen without adding the necessary elements to make it a compelling animated experience, or they are so preoccupied with being recognized as profound animated works that they rely too heavily on traditional film techniques and color grading, therebylosing the unique personality and flairthat made the original work special. Rather than regurgitating an experience fans could otherwise encounter by simply reading the manga,Dan Da Danexceeded expectations by boldly following the beat of its own drum with an anime that genuinely adapts creator Yukinobu Tatsu’s ongoing manga. DescribingDan Da Danis like conveying what an okapi looks like to a schoolchild without a picture. It’s an anomalous chimera in anime that meshes so many different genres that its episodes can go anywhere within the human imagination without feeling confined to just one thing. The 12-episode show follows the aftermath of school nerd Okarun and popular girl Momo Ayase clashing over whether aliens and yokai exist, only to find out they’re both right. Momo gains spiritual powers, while a demon possesses Okarun, and he loses his private parts (which aremagically infused). Their call to action? Retrieve Okarun’s family jewels. Despite its un-serious logline,Dan Da Dantriumphs as the must-watch anime of 2024. While the show comes off as aMad Libsshonen anime premise with hijinks abound, the anime sidesteps become power fantasy fodder without substance by marryingsci-fi,romantic comedy, andgenuinely stirring dramato make a show that’s nigh impossible to compare to anything that came before it. Each week,Dan Da Danprovided a refreshing experience, encouraging fans to set aside heated power-scaling debates to relax instead and marinate on the show’s softer moments, which focus on romance and drama. Whether it is the emotionally mature slow-burn romance between the leads, which replaces contrived falling-outs with constructive and cute conversations, or the gripping backstory within its enemy-of-the-week formula,Dan Da Danexcels in all aspects. Even the show’s most controversial element—its depiction of risqué moments among the cast, including portrayals of sexual abuse often labeled as “fan service” in the anime community—is handled with care and respect. Week in and week out,Dan Da Dan‘s action is equally kinetic and absurd, with Okarun and Momo combating a giant crab, golden-glove-boxing aliens, and esoteric cryptids like the Flatwoods and theLoch Ness monster. While already masterful and easy to follow in Tatsu’s manga, the sense of scale, weight, and choreography are elevated to even greater heights withScience Saru‘s flair for eccentric and provocative. The show balances its blockbuster showdowns with a captivating human drama among its leads, creating compelling angst driving the narrative. Despite the brisk pace of its intense action, charming meet-cute romance, and spellbinding drama,Dan Da Danmanages to maintain their significance within 24-minute episodes. Dan Da Danalso stands out among its contemporaries by having a musical score that is not understated. When the anime showcases a psychedelic battle with aliens and demons, artist Kensuke Ushio cranks the show’s pathos up to 11 with his inspired musical accompaniment. Chief among them is Ushio double-dipping with hisclub remix of Gioachino Rossini’s “William Tell Overture.” Even the show’s opening theme, “Otonoke” by Creepy Nuts, is a catchy earworm of a bop withcreative musical chop and screwing all its own. What’s more,Dan Da Dan‘s English and Japanese voice performances—often a contentious and archaic talking pointamong the anime community—are phenomenal. If anything, circling the block on “Dan Da DanThursdays” and catching A.J. Beckles and Abby Trott or Natsuki Hanae and Shion Wakayama, respectively, as Okarun and Momo adds an extra layer of texture to the characters through their unique performances. It’s also a treat to listen to Mayumi Tanaka’s (Monkey D. Luffy inOne Piece) and Barbara Goodson’s (Rita Repulsa inPower Rangers) vocal performances as Turbo Granny. Despite only having 12 episodes,Dan Da Dansets the stage for a potential paradigm shift in the shonen genre, demonstrating the lengths to which creatives can push the boundaries without resorting to well-trodden stereotypes. Thankfully, unlike fellow anime game-changerChainsaw Man, fans will not have to wait long forDan Da Danto ramp up from its cliffhanger ending with a second season.

87,Feds Warn SMS Authentication Is Unsafe After ‘Worst Hack in Our Nation’s History’,"Do you use text messages for multi-factor authentication? You should probably switch to a different method, especially with everything we’re learning about a recent hack that’s been dubbed the “worst in our nation’s history.” Even the federal government is putting out warnings now, including a call for government officials to only use encrypted apps for communication. Hackers aligned with the Chinese government have infiltrated U.S. telecommunications infrastructure so deeply that it allowed the interception of unencrypted communications on a number of people, according to reports that first emerged inOctober. The operation, dubbed Salt Typhoon, apparently allowed hackers to listen to phone calls and nab text messages, and the penetration has been so extensive they haven’t even been booted from the telecom networks yet. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued guidance this week on best practices for protecting “highly targeted individuals,” which includes anew warningabout text messages. “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication. SMS messages are not encrypted—a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them. SMS MFA is not phishing-resistant and is therefore not strong authentication for accounts of highly targeted individuals,” the guidance, which has been posted online, reads. Not every service even allows for multi-factor authentication and sometimes text messages are the only option. But when you have a choice, it’s better to use phishing-resistant methods like passkeys orauthenticator apps. CISA prefaces its guidance by insisting it’s only really speaking about high-value targets. Incredibly, even the FBI has come out to endorse theuse of encryption, which perhaps speaks to just how serious this intrusion into U.S. telecom infrastructure has become. The FBI has a very long history of opposing encryption of any kind, at least without providing some kind of backdoor that law enforcement can walk right through. Apps like Signal provide end-to-end encryption for messaging, though they don’t make it impossible to be hacked. “Adopt a free messaging application for secure communications that guarantees end-to-end encryption, such as Signal or similar apps,” CISA said in its new guidance. “CISA recommends an end-to-end encrypted messaging app that is compatible with both iPhone and Android operating systems, allowing for text message interoperability across platforms. Such apps may also offer clients for MacOS, Windows, and Linux, and sometimes the web.” There has been criticism of both the federal government and telecom companies for not taking Salt Typhoon seriously enough. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, spoke with theWashington PostandNew York Timesback in late November about the threat and sounded the alarm. But there has been the lingering question of what the average person can do about any of it. The answer, it seems, is that regular people can heed the advice of agencies like CISA when they make announcements intended for high-profile individuals.",Even the U.S. government is telling Americans to use encrypted apps.,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/feds-warn-sms-authentication-is-unsafe-after-worst-hack-in-our-nations-history-2000541129,
88,Apple AirDrop for Android? It Sounds Like a Dream That Will Never Come True,"I have a unique lifestyle, constantly shuffling between different smartphone platforms. I wish sharing files between Apple and Android devices was easier, so my ears perked up when I saw the EU Commission asking Apple to open up AirDrop. Under the guise of promoting “effective interoperability” within the smartphone industrythrough the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission is asking Apple to open the gates of its walled garden a little more so that Android users and anyone else who wants access can periodically play inside.The commission writes: “The preliminary findings in the first specification proceedings outline the proposed measures the Commission considers Apple should implement to effectively comply with its interoperability obligations in relation to several iOS connectivity features, predominantly used for and by connected devices. These can be notifications, automatic Wi-Fi connection, AirPlay, AirDrop, or automatic Bluetooth audio switching.” This proposal was initially madein September,but today, the European Commission is more specific about what it wants to open up. It mentions notifications, Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth audio switching, and AirDrop, the Apple ecosystem’s major claim to fame and most proprietary offering. In its “interoperability” report, Apple responded, “It’s getting personal.” The company alleges that the DMA’s suggestions will open up its platform in a way that puts “users at risk, requiring them to open their devices—and their most sensitive data—to companies with a track record of violating their privacy.” The company explicitly calls out Meta and its properties in the PDF published on Apple’s developer website,which you can readin full: “If Apple were to have to grant all of these requests, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could enable Meta to read on a users device all of their messages and emails, see every phone call they make or receive, track every app that they use, scan all of their photos, look at their files and calendar events, log all of their passwords, and more. This is data that Apple itself has chosen not to access in order to provide the strongest possible protection to users.” Apple insists that it lets its users decide whether or not to share certain information required for a particular user experience. It says that what the DMA asks for could result in companies like Meta gaining “unfettered access to users’ devices and their most personal data.” Apple says Meta has requested access to features like AirPlay, App Intents, CarPlay, iPhone Mirroring, and the Continuity Camera. Apple is fantastic at marketing itself as a company that cares first and foremost about its users. I don’t particularly like opening Android to every third-party player, either. I’m convinced that if we all stay in separate lanes, we’ll be fine and more secure. But this seems like something Apple could cede to, in a way. For instance, Android uses Google Cast and Quick Share to shuffle streaming and files between devices. I don’t necessarily need access to AirPlay and AirDrop, the Apple platform’s equivalents, to get that experience. I need Apple to allow that kind of third-party usage. Most streaming apps, even on iOS, already default to Google Cast if they find there are devices available on a network. The EU Commission’s next steps are to “carefully assess” the feedback Apple and other “interested parties” have provided. It has about six months to consider all this and determine how Apple should comply in a way it deems fair to all users. I’m personally curious to see how this ends up. If it means an easier time sending photos to an Android device, I may have difficulty seeing it from Apple’s point of view.","As the Digital Market Act keeps expanding, the EU asks Apple to open up more of its walled garden.",Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/apple-airdrop-for-android-it-sounds-like-a-dream-that-will-never-come-true-2000541134,
89,Police Say Google Maps Just Helped Them Solve a Missing Person Case,"In the course of its globe-mapping mission, a Google Street View car appears to have documented the very moment that crime suspects deposited what sure looks a whole helluva lot like a wrapped-up corpse in the back of a car. That supposed corpse is believed to be a Cuban man whose relativereported him missinglast year. The man had traveled to Spain and was living in the remote municipality of Soria at the time of his disappearance, reportedly in the hopes of finding a woman that he believed to be his romantic partner. The relative received suspicious texts from the man’s phone that convinced him something was wrong. This year, part of the man’s dismembered body was found buried in a cemetery in the local hamlet of Tajueco, confirming that he had been murdered. In a statement nowreleased by police(that has been translated from Spanish to English via, again, Google), investigators said that two people had now been arrested in connection with the man’s disappearance. Curiously, a key bit of evidence that had helped the police lock onto the suspects were “images in a location application” that appeared to have “detected a vehicle that may have been used during the course of the crime,” the statement says. That application, apparently, was Google Maps. Indeed, a Google Street View car just happened to be passing by a street in Tajueco when one of the suspects in the case was packing…something…into the back of a red car.BBC reports thatthis was the first time in 15 years that Google had traveled to the tiny Spanish town, a community of some 56 people.

90,You’ll Have to Wait About 28 Weeks for 28 Years Later‘s Sequel,"You won’t have to wait 28 years for the sequel to28 Years Later. In fact, you’ll basically only be waiting about 28 weeks. Sony just announced that the sequel toDanny Boyle’s 2025 zombie sequelwill be released on January 16, 2026. It’s called28 Years Later: The Bone Templeand,as we previously knew, it’s directed by Nia DaCosta. That’s a lot of numbers and dates so let’s reset here. In 2002, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland made a zombie film called28 Days Later.The film was a hit and, in 2007, we got a sequel called28 Weeks Later.That did fine but the franchise went quiet for a bit until Garland, who himself became a celebrated director,came up with a new idea. That film,28 Years Later, is scheduled for release June 20, 2025 and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Ralph Fiennes.The trailer was just releasedand was so successful,Sony unearthed the original for digital release. 28 Years Laterwas created to be thefirst film in a zombie trilogythough so Sony quickly hired Nia DaCosta(Candyman, The Marvels)to make its sequel. It’ll be the first film that doesn’t change the length of time, just adding a subtitle: “The Bone Temple,” whatever that means. Any details about part three are still a mystery at this point. After waiting years upon years for these sequels though, having the two films come out 30 weeks apart (six and a half months, basically) is rather exciting. That kind of thing doesn’t happen too often these days (or, even if it’s the plan, it’s usually canceled) so we’ll see how it goes. No word on the plot ofThe Bone Templebecause, frankly, we don’t quite know the plot of28 Years Lateryet.

91,"Invasive Murder Hornet Gone From the U.S., Officials Confirm","It’s time to pour one out for the murder hornet. Federal and state officials in Washington announced this week that the northern giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) has been officially eradicated from the United States. Officials from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported the good news on Wednesday. The decision to declare the insect eradicated was made after three years of no confirmed sightings in the state or elsewhere in the country. Scientists were worried that the pest could have become a prolific predator of honeybees and other native pollinators had it gained a foothold in the area. “We are proud of this landmark victory in the fight against invasive species,” said Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, in astatementfrom the WSDA. V. mandariniais the largest hornet wasp living today. It’s nicknamed the murder hornet because of its viciousness toward other insects, not humans (that said, their stings may be responsible for up to50 human deathsa year). The wasps are known to completely slaughter beehives within hours, often by decapitating their prey. They originate from Asia andfirst began to appearin the U.S. and Canada along the Pacific Northwest in 2019. For the next few years, officials, scientists, and the public waged a small-scale war against the hornet. People would spot a potential hornet nest in their neighborhood, call their local entomologist, and once a sighting was confirmed, the scientists would track down the nest and wipe it out. At the peak of its invasion, the scientists killed as many as1,500 hornetsper nest. But since 2021, the hornet hasn’t shown itself in the state—well, probably. The WDSA did receive an image of a “suspicious hornet” from a resident in Kitsap County earlier this October. The scientists weren’t able to obtain an actual specimen from that sighting, however. As a precaution, the WDSA set traps and encouraged residents in the area to report any shifty-looking wasps, but no further evidence of the hornet’s renewed presence ever emerged. It’s likely that this initial report was simply a misidentification (something that happens quite often withthese insects in particular), but the WSDA does plan to lay traps in the county next year just in case. “Although they are now eradicated from the state, we’ll always be keeping an eye out for them and encourage community members to do the same. They got here once and they could do it again,” said Sven Spichiger, WSDA pest program manager, in a statement. Unfortunately, the murder hornet isn’t the onlyinvasive bee-killing waspthat’s stirring up trouble in the U.S as of late. And both native and farmed bees are still facingmany other dangersthreatening their population numbers. But for once, it looks like we were able to stop an environmental disaster in the making before it was too late.","Federal and local officials declared victory over the northern giant hornet this week, following years of no sightings in the country.",Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/invasive-murder-hornet-gone-from-the-u-s-officials-confirm-2000540987,
92,Everything We Noticed in the Epic First Trailer for Superman,"The first trailer forJames Gunn’sSupermanis hereand, wow. It’s a lot. There’s not much in the way of talking but the two minute-plus trailer is robust in terms of tone, character, and setting. Below,we break down who’s who, what’s what, speculate, and see what little teases Gunn has in store along the way. Here’s our breakdown of the first trailer forSuperman. The trailer starts in a snowy field when an object flies in from the sky and crashes into the ground. This is Superman (David Corenswet) and he’s messed up. Breathing heavy, bloodied, this is not what we’re used to seeing from the character. He’s basically indestructible, is he not? How did this happen? Now,if you read our report from the set of the film, Gunn saidthatSupermanstarts in the middle of a massive battle. Then, io9 spoke to Gunn at a recent event where he confirmed these scenes are from the very beginning of the movie. That’s quite the twist, is it not? This isn’t him being beaten up in the climax of the film. It’s where everything starts. Busted-up Superman is intercut with scenes of his alter ego, Clark Kent, entering the Daily Planet. Again, from our set report we know this exterior was filmed in Cleveland, Ohio, the birthplace of Superman. But in this film, as you can see from the plaque, it’s Metropolis. Upstairs at the Daily Planet, we meet Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and also get a glimpse of Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo). On screen, you see Annalisa Cochrane(Cobra Kai)though it’s unclear if she’s a news anchor or an actress on TV. Either way, it’s a bustling newsroom. After a few close-ups of Lois and Clark, which show more of a friendship than anything else, the trailer moves to the Kent farm, which has cows roaming in the front yard. There we see Clark with his Earth father, Jonathan (Pruitt Taylor Vince). What’s interesting about this shot is that Clark doesn’t have the glasses. He looks more like he does as Superman. Maybe this speaks to the true Clark/Superman that only a few people know, like his parents. All this still is intercutting with Superman bloodied in the snow. Back there he whistles, and a figure runs through the powder. It’s Krypto, Superman’s dog! First introduced in 1955 as a companion of Superboy, and originally conceived as a one-off character by creators Otto Binder and Curt Swan, Krypto’s immediate popularity saw him become a staple of Superman’s adventures ever since, and helped inspire a legion of super-pets in his wake. “Krypto. Home,” Superman says. “Take me home.” So he gives Krypto a sniff of his cape and off the two go. Also, by the way, where did Krypto get his cape? Does his origin fit into this? We don’t know. And, again, all this stuff with Krypto and Superman in the snow is from the BEGINNING of the movie. What could’ve gotten Superman so badly? Here’s where things kick into high gear. First, we see Superman save a girl from some kind of explosion of gas tanks. The explosion comes during a massive kaiju battle. You can see the monster’s foot in the back here, and in full form later. We think, but are just speculating, that this fight might be the one that starts the movie and beats him up so badly. The next several shots focus on Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). First, he sees Superman whiz by and turns around while rocking an earpiece. That cuts to this image of Lex’s building and company in the film, Luthorcorp. And while we thought that might be him as a tiny speck on the bridge below the first “R,” that may, in fact, be The Engineer played by María Gabriela de Faría. Gunn confirmed to io9 she was in the trailer but hard to spot andsome fineX userspointed it outto us. Good spot! This next shot is curious. It’s Lex, again, who seems interested and even confused by a seemingly normal-looking revolver. We know from our chat with Gunn that Lex is a master of technology in this movie. So much so he’s basically a “sorcerer.” Why is he so perplexed and fascinated by a gun that would fit in an old Western? Kryptonite bullets possibly? That’s followed by Superman punching out of some kind of glass enclosure. It looks like it’s part of a larger building and, juxtaposed after several shots of Lex and Luthorcorp, the assumption is it’s something inside that building. Plus, at the VERY beginning of the shot, you see there are other people around him. Fellow prisoners? We don’t know. From there, the trailer cuts to a foreign country where war is being waged. A young man heroically lifts a flag with Superman’s symbol on it and prays for Superman to come and save him. Later in the trailer, it’s revealed this is a border war in Boravia, a fictional country in the DC universe. Boravia is also a classic Siegel-Schuster creation, having first appeared in the second issue ofSupermanin 1939, almost always defined by being in a state of perpetual internal conflict. How it fits into the story we don’t know, but it does speak to Superman being a global hero in this DC Universe. He’s not just saving people in Metropolis. It’s everywhere. Maybe the people of Metropolis are angry at Superman for saving people around the world, though, because the next section of the trailer focuses on angry mobs letting Superman have it. They’re throwing things. Screaming at him. And he’s taking it. Plus, you can see that his suit has been considerably dirtied up. He’s been in quite a battle. People are pissed! And it’s weird that Superman would be able to find refuge in this lobby, is it not? Unless it was somewhere friendly. This is the lobby of Stagg Industries, another reference to DC Comics. In the comics, its owner Simon Stagg is the one behind Rex Mason’s transformation into the character of Metamorpho, who we’ll soon see in the trailer. Whether or not that’s still the case here, is unclear. So we have dejected Superman, standing the lobby of Stagg, who is then joined by several heroes. The first is Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion). One of several humans to have become a member of the Green Lantern Corps, Guy—and his infamous haircut—first appeared in the late ’60s as the “backup” Lantern of Sector 2814 to Hal Jordan. We know Guy will also make an appearance in theLanternsTV series, set to feature two of the other most famous human Green Lanterns: Hal Jordan and John Stewart. And, you can see in that shot he’d joined by Hawkgirl, played byMadame Web‘s own Isabela Merced. You can briefly get a glimpse of Mister Terrific in a quick shot too, but more on him later. The trailer gives Hawkgirl a nice hero shot through. Hawkgirl has hadmanydifferent iterationsin the comics over the years, so we’re not quite sure which version of her we’re getting here. We then see a much better shot of the mystery kaiju Superman was fighting and saving that girl from. Looks pretty scary. After a shot of Superman floating in that fire, things get even steamier. First up, we get this shot of Superman and Lois. And I say “Superman” specifically because you can track how Lois treats Superman one way and Clark the other. There’s something there, but they are just getting close. Nothing more. Also—it’s that weird ball of energy that was in the first promo shot of the film. We still have no idea what that is but we think it might be from near the end of the movie. Okay, so that’s Lois and Superman. Here’s Lois and Clark. And they’re fully making out. So are Clark and Lois dating but she doesn’t know he’s Superman? I mean, come on. You’re a smart woman, Lois! He sure looks like Superman, does he not? Gunn did say their relationship in the film is unlike anything we’ve ever seen in a superhero movie so, surely there’s more to it than that. Moving along, this is a fascinating one. Here we see Superman sad about the death of a robot. It also appears this takes place in the Fortress of Solitude, which hasn’t been featured at all in this trailer so far. (The next shot after this, however, is the Fortress coming out of the ground so—yes, it’s in there.) It’s unclear who the robot is though and some have speculated it’s Kelex, a Kryptonian service robot who once served Jor-El before surviving the destruction of Krypton and becoming the caretake of the Fortress. If it’snotKelex, the cape and the general Superman-esque color scheme on the robot could be a nod to one of the film’s major comics inspirations,All-Star Superman, which saw a whole host of robotic Supermen assist Clark in maintaining the Fortress of Solitude. That’s then followed by our first look at Metamorpho played byBarry’sAnthony Carrigan. Again, Metamorpho was created by Stagg in the comics, after he sent Rex Mason to go investigate the mysterious radioactive meteorite known as the Orb of Ra, knowing the object could irrevocably transform Rex after he caught him in a relationship with his daughter, Sapphire. Okay, now things really kick into high gear with lots of very quick cuts. First up, buildings toppling over like dominos. Possibly from the kaiju fight? Either way, a very cool image. And maybe I’m seeing things but does the top of that last building look a little green to you? Lex Luthor is PISSED. And injured. And not in his Luthorcorp building, it seems, because it looks more gold than silver. There’s a lot going on in this next image so check it out and then we’ll break it down. First of all, whoever is watching this (unclear) owns a Luthorcorp TV (interesting). Again, we’re seeing more footage from the conflict glimpsed earlier, properly confirmed as Boravia here. Which, from earlier in the trailer, we know is hoping for Superman’s help. In fact, it might even be the same kid. Also, the channel is GBS News. The “G” in there isn’t an “M” so it’s probably not Metropolis. Someone might be watching this from Gotham City. We next see Superman trying to hold up a building, Krypto dragging him in the snow (both from scenes earlier in the trailer), and then someone, we think Metamorpho, smashing a wall. That’s followed by a battle in a baseball stadium (whichMajor League Baseball confirmedwas shot in the Cleveland Guardians stadium). Earlier in the trailer it doesn’t look like Metamorpho is wearing a suit but, clearly, this person is. Is it Metamorpho? He could certainly be a challenge for Superman. Or is it someone else? Someone in a suit Lex has developed perhaps? Either way, the grounds crew for the Metropolis Meteors is gonna have a hell of a cleanup. Finally, we get our best glimpse yet at Mister Terrific, played byFor All Mankind‘s Edi Gathegi. Mister Terrific—this is more clearly the Michael Holt version of the character, introduced back in 1997, frequently a prominent member of the Justice Society of America—is one of Gunn’s favorite characters, which is why he’s in the movie. Gunn also revealed he’s the leader of this group of heroes that’ll be beside Superman in the movie. The shot continues to reveal more about him. Mister Terrific doesn’t have powers beyond his own high technical skill and smarts, which he has used to develop tech to help him be a hero, mainly, his T-Spheres, which you see here. It seems also as if, in context of the movie, Mister Terrific is protecting Lois Lane from gunfire (maybe on assignment in Boravia?) with Jimmy Olsen (kneeling right) in tow. Why are these people shooting at a journalist? Where is Superman? There’s Superman. And he’s kissing Lois in mid-air. Before, we saw her kissing Clark so we’re guessing this is from later in the movie when she realizes the two are one. A gorgeous shot though, in some sort of old building that certainly fits in with the kind of classic architecture we’ve seen in Metropolis elsewhere in the film. And just like that… Superman flies off. But not before the two stars share a warm embrace (with that weird sky thing still looming in the background). Now, throughout this whole trailer, there have also been title cards. Let’s recap those for a second. “From James Gunn, director of theGuardians of the Galaxytrilogy, this summer, it begins.” That’s followed by a ton of footage and then the release date, July 11. Finally, this. That’s where the title of the movie should go, not the studio logo. But we never are explicitly told this isSuperman. This is DC Studios. A few things here. First,Supermanis the first film in the new DC Universe, and the kick-off of what DC Studios has to offer. So this trailer isn’t just forSuperman, it’s for the entire studio and universe. We asked Gunn about the decision. “It just felt good,” he said. “We had made these trailers and they did all this testing and I was like… I believe in testing. I believe in the testing process, and we’ve already testedSuperman. But it’s also like, you have to go with your gut and what feels right … [and it] seems like it worked.” Gunn also told us that the Engineer, another key DC Comics character who is in the movie, IS in this trailer. We didn’t spot her, but maybe you can? [UPDATE: We did, see the Luthorcorp shot above.] And finally, Gunn added that this trailer was specifically crafted to evoke the emotions of the movie. “There was only one thing that was on the forefront of my mind [and] that was the trailer has to be an authentic representation of what the film is,” Gunn said. “It doesn’t have to have every single element that’s in the film, obviously, but it has to show what is the basic essence of the movie and the story we’re telling. And I think that it does that.” If the movie is as good as this trailer, we’re in for a treat.Supermanopens July 11. Want more io9 news?

93,Instagram Will Soon Let You Transform Your Stories With Text-to-Video AI Slop,"One common complaint about Instagram, and social media in general, is that it breeds insecurity by presenting an unrealistic impression of other people’s lives as being better than they really are—the best moments only. And heavy editing of physical appearances isknown to contribute to body dissatisfactioneven when people know what they are seeing is not the full picture. Instagram is soon going to make that situation somewhat worse by allowing users to completely transform their videos using generative AI. In ateasershared by Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram was able to completely transform his appearance, in one shot turning himself into a felt puppet, and in another transporting Mosseri from his office to a snowy mountain range with a furry coat. In another, he was able to place a hippo behind him that jumped around and looked into the camera. “A lot of you make amazing content that makes Instagram what it is, and we want to give you more tools to help realize your ideas,” said Mosseri. “You should be able to do anything you want with your videos. You should be able to change your outfit or change the context in which you’re sitting… Whatever you can think of.” The new feature, which will be available sometime in 2025, is powered by Meta’s Movie Gen AI model. The announcement comes shortly after both OpenAI and Google DeepMind unveiled their own video generation models. By making these tools available on Instagram, Meta is showing off how generative AI can have immediate applications within its suite of apps. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants toinfuse the company’s full suite of appswith AI, including through content in the feed that is tailored specifically to each user’s interests. Of course, while early demos of video generation models have been promising, they are not perfect. OpenAI’s Sora has presented a lot of issues that you might expect, like objects disappearing and faces changing in appearance after only a few seconds. Mosseri only showed off one-second demonstrations of Movie Gen AI, so although they look quite impressive, we will have to see if they hold up their quality in longer clips. There are certainly some interesting ways generative AI within Instagram could be used in fun and entertaining ways. The question is whether those outweigh the negatives. Putting mental health concerns aside, AI has already filled Facebook feeds with fake imagery that older or more credulous users are susceptible to believing is real, and it is too early to say what harm that will ultimately cause.",A teaser showed Instagram head Adam Mosseri completely transform his appearance using simple text prompts.,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/instagram-will-soon-let-you-transform-your-stories-with-text-to-video-ai-slop-2000540924,

Varietyreports that Paramount is celebratingthe solid reviewsfor the latest entry in the series by confirming thatSonic 4is already on the way. It’s currently unknown (but, presumably, very likely) whether or not Jeff Fowler, who has directed all of theSonicfilms so far, will return forSonic 4, which is currently eyeing a 2027 release. The news comes asSonic 3—which hit aseries-high Rotten Tomatoes score of 86%when reviews dropped earlier this week—is expected to bring in an estimated $55-60 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. While exact plot details for a fourthSonicfilm are being kept under wraps for now, no one familiar with the films so far should be surprised that the third one is already leaving hints for even more video game characters to make their way to the big screens, after the original set up bringing Tails (and eventuallyIdris Elba’s Knuckles) into the sequel, andSonic 2laid the way forShadow’s major roleinSonic 3. “It’s fun to see the fan debates online about who’s coming up next, who’s going to be teased at the end of the film. We have a lot of the same conversations,” Fowler recently toldEntertainment Weekly. “We’ve all got our favorites on the filmmaking side, and we’re all making great cases for ‘it should be this one or that one.’ It is fun to keep that anticipation. This movie is no different in terms of teasing new characters.” We won’t have to wait long to see who Sonic and friends will be going up against next, withSonic 3hitting theaters tomorrow, December 20.

95,Samsung May Be Creating a Larger Galaxy Ring for Big Fingers,"Do you have big fingers? Are you feeling left out of the smart ring revolution? The good news is that Samsung is likely working on making its Galaxy Ring available in more sizes to accommodate more people. Right now, the smart ring is limited to size 13. Soon, Samsung could offer sizes 14 and 15, putting it on par with other best-selling smart rings in the marketplace—the ones it’s directly competing with. The leak comes from deep in the internet and has not been confirmed by Samsung. But91MobilesandMax Jamborhave been on point with leaks, so we’re taking their word on this one for now. The details of the sizing come from a leaked user guide that lists nine model numbers for the Galaxy Ring. Each smart ring size has a model number, and now there’s a “14” and a “15” available alongside all the rest. While no additional details are offered, the model numbers follow the standard naming convention, which is why it’s so believable. The new sizes will likely debut in January 2025.No specific date has been offered, but this may be a minor “one more thing” that Samsung will roll out at itsGalaxy Unpackedevent, which is expected next month. I can see Samsung rolling out the red carpet for the Galaxy S25, then lauding itself for inventing the smart ring and announcing thatit has so much confidence in its product that it’s launching it in two more sizes. While the larger ring sizes will help attract an additional subset of users, they will also help legitimize the Galaxy Ring against the rest of the competition. The Oura Ring, one of the other very popular smart rings that have gained traction over the past few years, is already offered in varying sizes, up to a size 15. It’s made such a name for itself that it helped convince health insurance companies to cover the cost as a health aid. You can also buy the Galaxy Ring with your Flexible Spending Account (FSA) if you have one. Samsung advertises the ability on its online store. It can now be considered alongside all those other third parties by offering more sizes. Samsung is also probably betting that you’ll want a tracking accessory that matches the brand of your smartphone since sticking with the Galaxy Ring makes sense if you already utilize Samsung Health.","The smart ring is still too small for some users, but additional sizes are coming in the new year to accommodate larger digits.",Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-may-be-creating-a-larger-galaxy-ring-for-big-fingers-2000540973,
96,Of Course Dan Da Dan Is Coming Back for Season 2,"To mark the end ofDan Da Dan‘sfirst season, Science Saru announced we won’t have to sit on our hands and wait long to know whether or not the show has any shot at a second season, because the anime has been renewed. What’s more, fans will only have to wait seven months to pick up on the show’s cliffhanger becauseDan Da Danwill make its grand return in July 2025. The news, which leaked ahead of the premiere of the show’s 12th episode on X/Twitter, was then made official on theofficialDan Da Dansocial media account. Coupled with the announcement was a poster teasing the events that lie in store for Okarun and Momo Ayase in the show’s second season. Key among the notable figures in the season two poster were images of Jiji Enjoji with Evil Eye looming over his shoulders; floating portraits of famous composers like Beethoven, Bach, and Franz Schubert (don’t ask); and a glimpse of upcoming cast member, Vamola, in her titular Godzilla spacesuit (also don’t ask).

97,Influential Hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 Study Finally Retracted,"Widely disputed research that wasted time and potentially endangered people during the pandemic is finally dead in the ground. This week, a scientific journal’s publisher retracted an influential study that claimed to show the drug hydroxychloroquine could treat covid-19, following years of criticism over the study’s design and analysis. Elsevier issued itsretractionof the study on Tuesday, citing concerns about how it was conducted and whether patients were properly recruited into it. The study sparked massive interest into the potential of hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19, with even President Trump supporting its use. Many experts were skeptical about the study’s findings, however, and subsequent studies failed to replicate its results. Hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, has long been a valuable medication, once commonly used to treat acute malaria infections and more often these days to treat symptoms of autoimmune disorders like lupus. Based on lab studies, some scientists had also speculated that the drug could have a broad antiviral effect, possibly allowing it to be repurposed as a treatment for covid-19. The now-retracted small study, published in theInternational Journal of Antimicrobial Agentsin March 2020, seemed to bolster this hunch. It found that people given HCQ had lower levels of the virus on average or cleared the infection more quickly; those who also took the antibiotic azithromycin appeared to recover even quicker. The findings led to a surge of interest in the drug. A day after the study was published, President Trumptoutedthe combination therapy as a “game changer” for the pandemic. The U.S. government and other organizations announced soon after that they would start large-scale trials to test out hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. It didn’t take long for other scientists toraiseconcerns about the study, its methodology, and its authors—particularly senior author Didier Raoult, a physician and microbiologist—concerns that have since been widely validated. Elsevier’s staff, along with outside experts, conducted an investigation into the study, following numerous complaints from other scientists. The team identified several potential ethical lapses. It’s not clear whether any of the patients involved in the study were enrolled in the study before approval was granted, for instance. The patients may have also been given azithromycin without proper permission. And while some of the authors did defend their findings, three authors told Elsevier that they had concerns “regarding the presentation and interpretation of results” and that they no longer wanted their names on the paper. At least ten other papers authored by Raoult havealso been retractedby Elsevier this year. Perhaps the most damaging legacy of this study is the futile wild goose chase it set in motion. Millions of covid-19 patients were dosed with HCQ as a result, but the vast majority of studiesfailed to showit had any benefit; some studies even found that it raised people’srisk of dyingfrom heart issues. Despite this research, many people continued to advocate for HCQ and othersuspicious covid-19 treatments(includingRobert F. Kennedy Jr, who may soon run the Department of Health and Human Services). Importantly, this fervent support for HCQ may have convinced some people to turn down proper care for their covid-19 infections. Scientists were able to find other, older drugs that were actually effective for covid-19, particularly the steroiddexamethasone. Thanks to these drugs and innovations like vaccines, Covid-19 is now much less of a public health threat. But the anti-science attitude that many backers of HCQ expressed in its defense is, unfortunately, very alive and well.","The now-debunked research, endorsed by Donald Trump, led to millions of covid-19 patients receiving a worthless drug.",Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/influential-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-study-finally-retracted-2000540847,
98,FAA Bans Drones in Parts of New Jersey as UFO Hysteria Continues,"The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to anoticepublished on the agency’s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed “drone” sightings, though the agency hasn’t said so explicitly. The FAA told theNew York Timesthe ban was enacted at the request of “federal security partners,” without elaborating further. The drone ban covers22 different New Jersey communitiesand is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It’s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn’t address Gizmodo’s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security. “We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,” a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record. “In coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,” the spokesperson wrote. People in New Jersey started reporting odd “drones” in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft. While it’s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who’s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down. But the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype. “Some of the drones are small. Some of the drones’ flight patterns are erratic,” Schumer said on Sunday, according toNBC News. “Multiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that’s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.” People are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines. Some of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they’re actually being deployed by anIranian mothershipoff the east coast of the U.S. “Know that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox NewsDec. 11. “The sources I have are good. They can’t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.” There’s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones.",Some insist these drones are piloted by intergalactic beings. Others claim they're regular airplanes. But who can say for sure?,Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/faa-bans-drones-in-parts-of-new-jersey-as-ufo-hysteria-continues-2000540949,
99,New York Man Digs Up Mastodon Fossil in His Backyard,"Some people want hippopotamuses for Christmas—but a man in Scotchtown, New York, got a mastodon. The man, who does not want to be identified, found a fossilized mastodon jaw, complete with the extinct giant’s distinctive teeth, in his backyard earlier this year. Scotchtown is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, and the jaw is the first found in the state in over a decade. A Dutch farmer unearthed the first mastodon found in North America in Claverack, New York, in 1705. Roughly 150 fossils of extinct elephant relatives have been found across the state—about one-third of them in Orange County—and according toUntapped New York, over a dozen mastodon fossils have been found in New York City alone. Suffice to say, southern New York was mastodon central back in the day. Mastodons are not to be confused with mammoths, though both roamed Earth through the Pleistocene and some of the Holocene. But there are somedifferences; mastodon heads were flatter and their tusks were less curvy. But the most obvious difference is in the teeth: Mastodon teeth have conical points—fittingly, the name “mastodon” literally means “breast tooth.” According to Robert Feranec, the New York State Museum’s director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age mammals, the man found the mastodon while gardening and originally mistook the teeth for baseballs. “When I found the teeth and examined them in my hands, I knew they were something special and decided to call in the experts,” the homeowner said in a museumrelease. “I’m thrilled that our property has yielded such an important find for the scientific community.” Subsequent excavation by museum staff and the State University of New York, Orange County, yielded a piece of a toe bone, a rib fragment, and the entire jaw of an adult mastodon. “While the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,” said Cory Harris, an anthropologist at SUNY Orange, in the same release. “We are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.” In recent years, advances in ancient DNA research have helped scientists better understand thelife and times of North American mastodons. In 2022, a team of researchers managed to unpack most of thelife history of the Buesching mastodon—affectionally called Fred—from his 13,000-year-old tusk. The researchers plan to carbon date the mastodon jaw to determine its precise age, but also its diet and the kind of habitat it lived in—just as the aforementioned team did with Fred. According to the museum, the fossil will be put on display sometime in 2025. North America’s proboscideans wentextinctby about 10,500 years ago, but their remains continue to reveal how the ancient beasts existed in life.","The proboscidean's jaw was found about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, and will be put on public display next year.",Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/new-york-man-digs-up-mastodon-fossil-in-his-backyard-2000540820,
100,Intel explains what went wrong with its new Arrow Lake desktop CPUs,"Intel's new Core Ultra 200-series desktop processors, codenamed Arrow Lake, launched to seriously underwhelming reviews back in October. Now the American firm has collated five issues that it says are to blame for the difference between its own performance expectations and what reviewers experienced, with four of the five problems described as being already resolved by BIOS, Windows or application updates, and further performance enhancements to arrive in January 2025.For context, ourCore i9 285K and Core i5 245K reviewsaw performance wins for the 285K against the outgoing 14900K in three titles -Crysis 3 Remastered,Dragon's Dogma 2andForza Horizon 5- while the 14900K retained its crown in the other eight games we tested, often by extreme margins.Here are the five issues, their root cause and current status, quoted from Intel's release:Performance TopicRoot CauseStatusUnusual scheduling, high run-to-run variation, low single-threaded scores, intermittent ~1.5x increase in DRAM latency, performance lower on Windows 11 24H2 vs 23H2Intel mistimed deployment of OS power plan settings (""PPM""), which customises DVFS, core parking and C-states.

In it, Intel promises ""a complete performance digest, inclusive of the January BIOSes"" at CES early next year, so we should get a better idea of exactly the performance differentials we should expect with all five fixes applied.We also saw extremely poor performance inCyberpunk 2077in particular, and that seems to have been solved in game update 2.2 ifthe patch notesare to be believed.If you are one of the vanishingly small number of people to be running a Core i5 245K, Core i7 265K or Core i9 285K system, then you've probably already updated to the latest Windows and BIOS versions, but it's worth doing so now if you haven't - and again in mid January when further BIOS updates are made available - to ensure that your system is delivering maximum performance. Intel says that the January BIOSes can be ""identified with Intel microcode version 0x114 and Intel CSME Firmware Kit 19.0.0.1854v2.2 (or newer).""We'll look to retest the Core i9 285K and Core i5 245K once these January BIOS updates are available, as we did see much worse performance than we expected and it would be nice to see what these proccessors are truly capable of. We're expecting to hear more from Intel at that time - as well as rivals AMD and Nvidia - so stay tuned for our reports from CES in the new year.","Intel's new Core Ultra 200-series desktop processors, codenamed Arrow Lake, launched to seriously underwhelming reviews back in October.

102,Tell us your favourite PlayStation memory and win a game's worth of PS Store vouchers,"UPDATE 12TH DEC:You never disappoint, do you. It's taken me hours to read through your comments, and they've made me laugh and well up a bit, and they've given me powerful pangs of nostalgia. Thank you for taking the time to share them and, well, remind me of the power gaming has.That's a clear theme in your comments: the power gaming has to bring us together. There are so many stories of people playing with friends they've lost touch with or that are sadly no longer here, as there are many stories of families playing together and connecting, sometimes in ways they never would again. Often, it doesn't even matter what they were playing; the point is they were playing together.But sometimes it really does matter what you're playing. Remember, the PlayStation 1 was the beginning of things, as Madame Drofla's comment reminds us - we didn't know back then that Sony would become the dominant gaming player it is today. This was the first time many of us would come into contact with legendary brands likeMetal Gear SolidandRatchet & Clankand - who could forget -Final Fantasy 7. There are more comments about FF7 here than any other.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsHowever, it's not only memories of games and friends that are here, it's memories of a different time. Memories of when people used to prop consoles up at funny angles so they would work, and memories of bricks and mortar shops where people would get their games or learn about them. Scrappier times, scruffier times, providing gaps and opportunities for memorable moments to occur. I don't think I've laughed harder than at H1ppyDave's incredible story of throwing a PS1 out of the window because a friend was pretending to be the police and they were all stoned.That's not the only story I want to shout out, though. Weebleman's story about a random Journey friend becoming a lifelong friend was really touching, as was Dyn Arall's well written account of becoming a PlayStation convert. And I still can't believe Tumbletwit's friend straight up bought them a PS3 Slim after a win at the bookies - what a pal!Rami thinking Psycho Mantis was controlling their real-world and making their ceiling fall down - which wasactuallyfalling down - made me laugh, as did hearing the lengths Davotron made their family go through in order to win a Cheesestring PlayStation competition. Cheesestrings of all things! Shrui's story about the ""epic prick"" who tried to buy their way to the front of the PS2 pre-order queue had lovely evocative language, too, and made me feel a bit better about humanity.Sandman connecting with a troubled nephew via Lunar Silver Star Story really got me in the feels, as did Mark Devis' memory of a departed friend, and Tony Almond's memory of a departed mother spoke to something similar in my own life, so that got to me too.There are so many - George Roper, Rahmus and Shifty Geezer's tales of friends playing together, of eras gone by, connected to something in me, and I enjoyed the vivid recollections of Cookie Monster and Alexandros Demetriades upon encountering PlayStation and its games for the first time. Thank you all.But the winning entry - and there is one after all that - is by HelderCH who, contrary to their own belief, does not suck at telling stories. Their tale of finding a community aroundShadow of the Colossuson PS2, and through it a friend who would, many years later, become a wife, has it all - games as a powerful experience, games helping someone through a difficult time, and games helping kindred spirits find each other.

You have some great stories.So what do you do? Simply share a story below. Think about a time that PlayStation featured in your life, for some memorable reason - maybe it brought people together, maybe someone did something silly and it still makes you laugh, maybe something else - and tell us about it in the comments.It was PlayStation's 30th anniversarythis week, as you'll know if you've been anywhere near our homepage, so I hope the memories are already flowing. There's 30 years of material there.A PlayStation memory that lives rent-free in my head is me hunched over an ironing board one summer, aiming a lightgun at a tiny TV in a scorching hot conservatory - I don't know why I put my friend's borrowed PS1 there - trying to beat Die Hard 2, which was bastard hard, if you remember. I think I shed a few pounds of weight in sweat that weekend. Then again, I also remember borrowing my friend's PS2 to playPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and I remember the first time I actually owned a PlayStation of my own - the bulbous and brilliantly arrogant PlayStation 3. I tell you: we played some SingStar on that.What do you remember?I'll go through the memories early next week and pick a winner, so you've got the weekend to think about it and write, if you need that long.

103,DF Weekly: Avatar is the latest PS5 Pro patch that looks worse than the base PS5 game,"In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we talk about the mooted PlayStation handheld (spoilers: it won't run native PS5 games) but it's our second news topic of the week I'll be writing about in more depth today.Avatar: Frontiers of Pandorahas arrived onPlayStation 5 Proand its spec points look impressive - you're getting the quality mode visuals of the base console version at 60fps. There's just one problem: the Pro version looks a lot worse than the standard console's quality mode and even its performance mode has some quality advantages over the Pro version. In which case, what's the point?We should expect to see some outlier software with the arrival of any enhanced console - games that aren't quite delivering what they should. In fact, we saw it with the launch of PlayStation 4 Pro back in 2016. If memory serves, The Last of Us Remastered could run at a lower frame-rate on Pro than it did on the base PS4 - andWatch Dogs 2also had similar issues. However, these were generally exceptions and were quickly patched. While the quality of Pro versions could vary dramatically, a noticeably worse image wasn't the issue - and yet, this is clearly happening with PS5 Pro. So many titles are affected now that many users are asking for the ability to run PS5 Pro-enabled games without the Pro features enabled. Instead, those games would run with standard model features, with only the extra CPU and GPU horsepower of the new console in use.My personal feeling on this is that it's a short term ""solution"" of sorts to a problem that will likely be resolved in the medium term, but to understand the problem is to focus on Sony's machine learning-based upscaling solution: PlayStation Spectral Resolution, or PSSR. This is essentially the PlayStation team's answer to Nvidia DLSS or Intel XeSS, where game engine inputs and a lower resolution are fed into a neural network, delivering an upscaled output fit for a 4K screen.DF Direct Weekly #191: PlayStation Handheld Reaction, Avatar PS5 Pro Issues, Half-Life 2 20th!Got a spare 140 minutes to watch/listen to the Digital Foundry team discussing the latest gaming and technology news?

There are many others, including Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part 1 and 2. However, Silent Hill 2 did - and does - have issues despite being patched, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor can look pretty hideous at times, while Star Wars Outlaws also has some profound issues. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is especially impacted because PSSR has issues with transparency effects - most notably foliage - and also seems to have quality problem with ray tracing inputs. It's also shown to lose a lot of quality the higher the upscaling factor. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora seems to operate with a 720p to 1800p dynamic resolution window, which paired with foliage and RT combines to create a 'three horsemen of the apocalypse' effect which ultimately makes the game look worse on Pro than it does on the standard console.Right now, the sense is that PSSR can be as detrimental to a game's presentation as it can be a boon - and that's a problem when you're selling an expensive enhanced console upgrade to the most dedicated fans in your userbase. The quality bar is very, very straightforward: a Pro-enhanced game cannot and should not ship if it's worse than the output of the standard model. In terms of quantifiable metrics, frame-rate shouldn't be lower and to be fair, we've not seen anything like that from Pro software so far. However, things are trickier when dealing with image quality where it's typically a more subjective appraisal. That said, Avatar is losing so much detail owing to PSSR 'noise' that a cursory A to B comparison should do the trick. Foliage (Jedi: Survivor) or RTAO (Dragon's Dogma 2) shouldn't be flickering noticeably when it does not do so on the original PS5. At some point the question needs to be asked: can't developers see what's going wrong here?We've often talked about an apparent weakness in QA that allows for 'easy to fix' but impactful problems to make their way into shipping code - and that's still a problem - but what we're looking at here is a basic failure to recognise and to fix superficial issues. It's very, very difficult to understand how the worst of the Pro problems ever made it to users and it suggests that developers are perhaps over-stretched and that QA really is lacking. At this point, there's also an argument that the platform holders themselves should do more as it's not a good reflection on their own hardware.PSSR Upscaling on PS5 Pro: The Good, The Bad and The UglyIn theory, a PS5 Pro game should deliver an across-the-board upgrade over the standard PS5 - but it's not always happening and PSSR implementations are a common theme. Rich, Oliver and Alex discuss.Watch on YouTubeThere has been some tacit recognition that PSSR isn't the complete solution right now and should perhaps be deployed more sparingly. Guerrilla Games didn't use it for its Horizon games and has delivered what we think is the best image quality we've seen in any console game. Both Santa Monica Studio and Polyphony Digital have delivered good PSSR support, but even then, have included the option to drop back to prior upscaling solutions. Meanwhile, with Fortnite on PS5 Pro, Epic has chosen to retain its own TSR upscaler - a technology deeply embedded and integrated with Unreal Engine 5.The obvious conclusion is that Epic didn't feel PSSR is a good fit for UE5 right now - born out with the UE5-driven Silent Hill 2, where Bloober Team's swapbackto TSR for its performance mode has ironed out its image quality issues. And yet, PSSR remains in the 30fps quality offering, which despite the higher resolution arguably looks worse overall than the 60fps performance alternative.As mentioned earlier, a possible solution is to offer a system-level 'opt out' of Pro upgrades and allow for Game Boost to operate on the standard PS5 version of the game - and such an option is said to exist on development Pro hardware. However, introducing a kind of fallback solution to mitigate failed Pro upgrades sends the wrong message when it's down to developers, publishers and the platform holder to get it right with their software.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsSo, where do we go from here? More thorough testing of Pro upgrades is a given, based on some of the most egregious examples we've seen. Rather than add a system level feature to disable all Pro features, a more streamlined solution may be to allow for PSSR to be a toggle, as it is in God of War Ragnarok or Gran Turismo 7. We've tested many, many games now and there do seem to be commonalities in where PSSR has issues - maybe there are problems inhowit is being implemented, but for so many studios to deliver software with similar issues, it does suggest that PSSR requires some work.We've heard plausible stories of different versions of PSSR making their way into titles with varying quality levels, along with continual quality improvements - which leads us on to the next point: how best to roll out PSSR improvements. On PC, all games using DLSS from version 2.0 contain a .dll in the game install folder that can be swapped out with later versions, exhibiting clear quality improvements. Nvidia now has four years of DLSS 2.0 development under its belt and while developers can patch their games to introduce later versions of the scaler, users can swap in new DLLs and literally improve anti-aliasing and upscaling in their own games. In theory, Sony could introduce a system level feature to automatically 'patch' PSSR to the latest version for all software. Ultimately, for a console experience, I still feel developers need to validate PSSR updates - but perhaps Sony can play its part in making the patching process easier, or even carry out the integration work itself subject to developer approval. Whichever way you slice it, there's clearly an issue that requires the platform holder to step in.Ultimately, what we are looking at here is the first console to arrive leveraging machine learning features - and there are going to be teething issues, just as there was with Nvidia DLSS back in the day. It'll take time to iron out some of these issues, but as machine learning is a crucial foundation for the next generation of consoles, I'm confident we'll get there. However, from a short term, consumer-focused perspective, we are dealing with a £700/$700/€800 enhanced console here - and in no way, shape or form should PS5 Pro versions of any game be worse than the same title running on the standard console.","In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we talk about the mooted PlayStation handheld (spoilers: it won't run native PS5 games) but it's our second news topic of the week I'll be writing about in more depth today.

105,DF Weekly: Silent Hill 2 patched on PS5 Pro - and PSSR is gone from the performance mode,"The arrival of a new working week can be pretty bleak, but hey - at least you have a brand new edition of DF Direct Weekly to watch or listen to. Despite the colossal workload we have, there's a huge amount of discussion this week - from an extended chat about the strengths and weaknesses of Sony's PSSR upscaling through to a look atAssassin's Creed Syndicate's 60fps patch and some quick impressions on the new PlayStation Portal update.This Direct is longer than usual, becauseBloober Teamreleased a patch forSilent Hill 2onPS5 Proafter filming, aimed at improving graphical problems - described in depth in Tom Morgan's coverage last week. So, has the game improved? The answer is yes, but it seems that the route forward was simply to roll back on PSSR support, dropping back to Epic's TSR upscaler - in the 60fps mode at least. PSSR remains in effect in the 30fps quality mode, so that's still presenting some issues.Let's recap on the issues as they stood with patch 1.05. In providing Pro support, Bloober Team shifted from the use of Epic's 'in house' upscaling solution - TSR (temporal super resolution) in favour of Sony's machine learning based alternative, PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution). In image quality terms, while PSSR has some advantages, they were significantly outweighed by the negatives - intrusive flickering in Lumen reflections, inconsistent global illumination and general 'noise' problems. Disocclusion issues were also problematic, with objects noticeably leaving visual artefacts when the camera moved. We went as far as to say that the Pro version of Silent Hill 2 looked worse than the standard PS5 version as a consequence.DF Direct Weekly #190: PSSR Problems but... Silent Hill 2 Pro Fixed?

In using this strategy, the game now reverts to the kind of image quality seen on the standard PlayStation 5 version of the game - and that's absolutely fine. We can't rule out dynamic resolution but it seems that performance mode is upscaling from something in the region of 1008p. There is a small frame-rate advantage over the standard PlayStation 5 rendition of the game, but it's not as big as expected - just a few fps higher. Perhaps this is explained by the standard PS5 running at 900p, with Pro operating with an improved pixel count.Beyond that, there's not much to tell the two versions of the game apart - they look quite similar. That said, there does seem to be a change in the way global illumination presents on the new patch - it looks significantly lighter than it does on the standard PlayStation 5. It's difficult to tell whether that's intentional or not but it's only really noticeable via direct A to B comparisons.All of which leaves us with the quality mode, which is in a very strange place right now. We can't discern much in the way of differences against the existing 1.05 code, meaning that PSSR is still in place and all of the existing problems we've documented are unchanged. What this also means is that - perversely - the image quality of the performance mode now using TSR is significantly better than the 30fps quality mode. That's a somewhat stark appraisal of the situation, but it is what it is. We hope that Bloober Team have effectively triaged Silent Hill 2 - prioritising a fix for the performance mode in terms of the distracting PSSR issues, with further optimisations to come. We'd like to see the frame-rate dips in the performance mode fully addressed and image quality fixed on the 30fps quality mode.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe discussion with Silent Hill 2 is our second news story of the week, with a 28 minute chat on PSSR taking point as the lead topic. While Silent Hill 2 andStar Wars Jedi: Survivorhave exhibited what we'd describe as egregious PSSR problems and shouldn't have shipped in the state they did, it's clear that there are a number of games where the technology is not delivering as it should. The idea is basically to see PSSR replace FSR 2 or Epic's TSR as the upscaler of choice, where the problems are manifest - especially at lower resolution. Now, to be clear, PSSR is capable of some excellent results, as you've seen in our coverage over the weeks, but there are clearly problems.In upscaling from resolutions under 1080p, there are image quality issues - as seen in Alan Wake 2, for example. However, we've also seen challenges when certain ray tracing effects are plumbed into PSSR. Again, Silent Hill 2 and Jedi Survivor bear mention, but Dragon's Dogma 2 is also presenting very noticeable issues - and has done since its debut at Sony's gameplay press event a while back. Looking back now, it's interesting to note that of all the problematic titles we've seen so far, Dragon's Dogma 2 was the only one that made it through to the hands-on events.So, what happens now? Bloober Team has put out what you might call a mitigation for the issues in Silent Hill 2, while Respawn says it is aware of the issues with Jedi: Survivor - as you'd hope bearing in mind how glaringly obvious they are. However, on a more general level, we need to accept that in entering the machine learning upscaling space, Sony is taking on industry juggernauts like Nvidia and indeed Intel, both of whom have shipped accomplished solutions. Up against DLSS, PSSR is up against best-of-the-best technology, iterated on over years by some of the most experienced, talented engineers in the business.Some might say that PSSR accomplishing what it has in a first generation product is a good achievement - and a great foundation for the updates to offer.That said, it's clear right now that PSSR in its current state requires careful integration - and it can't be seen as a 'fire and forget' solution to FSR, no matter how much we might want it to be. Sony will almost certainly get to the point where PSSR becomes a must-use foundational technology for PS5 Pro and whatever comes next, but this is just the start of the process.","The arrival of a new working week can be pretty bleak, but hey - at least you have a brand new edition of DF Direct Weekly to watch or listen to.

107,Where's our Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review?,"Hello! It's one of these again. You may have started to see some reviews going live forStalker 2: Heart of Chornobylright now, but ours won't be among them sadly - at least not just yet - so we wanted to let you know where ours was and why we're delaying it.In brief: we need a little more time with this one, for two main reasons. The first is that Stalker 2 is a pretty sizable game and we've not had all that long with it, so we're giving ourselves some extra breathing room to ensure we've been able to make significant enough progress for a full review.The second reason, though, is both more pertinent, and more troubling. At time of writing, the early review build of Stalker 2 that was sent to us by developerGSC Game Worldhas several, quite major technical issues. We've been assured that a Day One patch will be launched alongside the game's general release today, and so we want to make sure our appraisal is reflective of the version of the game you'll be playing yourself.As such, we're currently aiming to publish our review onFriday November 22nd, so you'll be able to read our full thoughts on Stalker 2 then.Technical issues are, of course, often part and parcel of big launches like this, and in the case of Stalker 2 - which let's not forget has been developedduring Russia's invasion of Ukraine- it's perhaps not entirely surprising.At the same time, however, the extent of some of these bugs has been hard to overlook. To give you a couple of examples of things we've experienced during our playthrough, we've seen cases where NPCs have become trapped in whirlwind anomalies, only to stay there spinning upwards into the sky when it dissipates rather than falling back to the ground. Characters have also got trapped inside walls, flailing wildly, and sometimes they won't appear at all, resulting in conversations with floating pairs of headphones. One Stalker we were travelling with also just dropped dead on the spot for no apparent reason.We've encountered a lot of issues with the game's sound, too. Lines of dialogue sometimes didn't trigger when they were supposed to, radio voices sounded clear as day like they were standing right next to us (and vice-versa), and occasionally subtitles appeared for different lines of dialogue to what was being spoken onscreen. We also had an ongoing issue with firing one of our guns, with gunshots going utterly silent for long stretches of time.There were also several instances where Stalker 2's bugs affected our quest progression, got us killed, left us confused and generally made it difficult to play.I should note that our review build has also been regularly patched as we played, and that several issues are actively being addressed by GSC Game World. However, until we can get a more thorough look at what that Day One patch amounts to, we thought it best to delay our verdict so we can investigate it more thoroughly.In the meantime, I'd suggest having a read of Rick Lane's extensiveStalker 2 previewfrom last month to help set the scene, and you should absolutely check out GSC Game World's very own documentary about the game's development,War Game: The Making of Stalker 2. You can also make sure your PC is up to snuff by reminding yourself ofStalker 2's PC requirements. Stay tuned for more from us soon, and thanks again for your patience!","Hello!

108,DF Weekly: What is an Xbox? Not an existential crisis but the latest phase of Microsoft's big transition,"What is an Xbox? It's a pretty straightforward question, right? I'd define it as a custom piece of gaming technology, generally box-shaped, that typically sits in the lounge or bedroom. Competitively priced, it's a mainstream-orientated product that offers a great balance between price and performance and is as close to plug and play gaming as you're going to get. It is a console, or is it? Microsoft begs to differ with its latest, remarkable messaging. A cloud client running on a smart TV, Amazon Fire Stick or Meta Quest VR headset is now an Xbox. A desktop PC is an Xbox. A laptop or PC handheld is also an Xbox. It's all part of Microsoft's transition plan to evolve Xbox from a console/PC ecosystem into an 'Everywhere' platform that's as device-agnostic as it's possible to be - but is it going to work?Looking at the market from a meta perspective, it'sgotto work. Xbox needs to reach out beyond the existing pool of console gamers. The basic economics are simple. Market data suggests that the amount of console users in total is not shifting from one generation to the next. Not only that, some data is suggesting that it is thesame peoplebuying those consoles from one generation to the next. In the meantime, the cost of making games is getting ever more expensive. The only sustainable route forward is to reach beyond circa 200m to 250m console gamers and find a larger audience. Microsoft began that work years ago in ending game exclusivity by releasing key titles day and date on PC - but the strategy now looks to be a case of releasing those games on any piece of hardware capable of running them.By virtue of its various acquisitions, Microsoft/Xbox has effectively become a multi-platform publisher that cannot and should not ignore rival console systems like Nintendo Switch, the Switch successor and PlayStation 5. When theActivision BlizzardKing acquisition was announced so long ago, we were still in the midst of console wars and the expectation may have been that Call of Duty would go Xbox exclusive - but the finances would not have worked, the regulatory pressure on the acquisition was too over-bearing and ultimately, Microsoft would likely have lost money by freezing out the PlayStation audience. I can only assume that the calculation was made that PlayStation users would not leave their libraries behind and 'defect' to Xbox - and why should they?DF Direct Weekly #189: Xbox Ports: ""No Red Lines"", Lego Horizon Reaction, Stellar Blade 2 PCBehold DF Direct Weekly #189, with Rich Leadbetter, John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie at the mics.Watch on YouTube0:00:39Introduction0:02:56News 1: Phil Spencer: no ""red lines"" on Xbox ports0:27:21News 2: Lego Horizon Adventures impresses on consoles0:36:40News 3: Halo 2 E3 demo resurfaces in Master Chief Collection0:51:30News 4: PS5 Pro sales reportedly not impacted by price1:01:35News 5: Stellar Blade developer considering PC release1:08:35News 6: Intel plans Arrow Lake performance fix1:17:47News 7: ModRetro Chromatic impresses1:28:37Supporter Q1: How will the next Xbox achieve the ""largest technical leap"" in a console generation?1:35:46Supporter Q2: If the next Xbox doesn't have a disc drive, how will disc backwards compatibility function?1:42:15Supporter Q3: Are you excited to see the rumoured Nvidia ARM-based laptop chip?1:48:22Supporter Q4: Will we see support for ultrawide aspect ratios on consoles?1:56:56Supporter Q5: Can we give Epic credit for allowing Internet Archive to host older Unreal games?Meanwhile, for various reasons, Xbox hardware sales have slowed down significantly - a combination of old Xbox One users on 'forever games' finding no reason to upgrade, along with a consistent lack of delivery of top-tier titles that may make users jump over to the Xbox brand. In acquiring a greater split of the existing, static market, it has failed. Therefore, a new strategy was required.Part of that strategy rests on the concept that Xbox can no longer be just a console and a PC app - and so we find ourselves confronted with the 'this is an Xbox' campaign. To Xbox diehards, this looks like a marginalisation of the console as the home of the platform. To others who know exactly what an Xbox is and has been since 2001, it may look desperate or even laughable. Part of the problem is that Microsoft is effectively marketing against 23 years of its own messaging - and that's a tough place to start from. The thing is, the marketing is not really aimed at the core audience. Microsoft has wider horizons.The truth is, the nature of the market is changing. The console audience may not be growing, but people are still enjoying games in record numbers. PC continues to be highly popular and gaming laptops in particular are shifting serious numbers. The laptop version of the RTX 3060 sits at number 11 in the graphics sub-section of the Steam Hardware Survey, while remarkably, the RTX 4060 laptop model is number two, ahead of its desktop equivalent (in fairness, it launched earlier, but even so, it's a remarkable state of affairs). Meanwhile, there's plenty of excitement around PC handhelds, where Microsoft is clearly seeing some kind of opportunity. Steam Deck has revealed latent potential here and some might say that Xbox has to move in this direction before Valve expands, dominating all areas of the PC market, up to and including the console space. An Xbox handheld is coming, but I would expect Windows improvements to make existing handhelds more Xbox-like in the meantime.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settings""This is an Xbox"" looks to be aimed at a wider and possibly younger audience, who don't seem particularly invested in the console concept - but there is risk in this strategy. The danger is that everything Microsoft has achieved with Xbox-as-a-console becomes sidelined, which is the key concern of prominent Xbox influencers, who fear a dilution of the brand and the community. The console is the focus and without it, Xbox becomes something quite different - a publisher, not a platform holder. At worst, Xbox becomes a client or a launcher, not that much different from EA or Ubisoft, just operating at a much larger scale.That may be somewhat alarmist as Microsoft is committed to new hardware. In an interview withBloomberglast week,Phil Spencerdiscussed a new handheld in development that's likely years away from release. Sarah Bond has talked about a Gen 10 console delivering the ""largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation"". And at the same time, there are also heavy hints about being able to run other storefronts on Xbox hardware - heralding some kind of merging between PC and console functioanlity. Expect machine learning to be doing a lot of heavy lifting in validating Sarah Bond's claims, especially as Spencer is ruling out $1000 consoles. I think Microsoft needs showcase hardware but the importance of PC going forward cannot be understated: we've been saying for some time now that Xbox and Windows should merge, effectively making every PC in every category an 'Xbox' of some description.And from there, the overall importance of the console starts to diminish. While a plug and play box remains, the market itself can take over with its own PC-based Xbox hardware and core users can literally build their own Xbox hardware. In parallel, Microsoft will continue to double down on cloud gaming, where Phil Spencer says there's already significant growth.The core audience hasn't exactly responded well to this marketing, but the chances are that it's not actually targeting core gamers at all. |Image credit:XboxMeanwhile, his comments on there being ""no red lines"" on which games go to other consoles should be taken seriously and literally. The ultimate hedge against the uncertain future for the console is simply to saturate all areas of the market with great games and reap the benefits - a much surer bet than building a business model around a box you lose money on with every sale. If a piece of hardware can run Call of Duty or - dare I say it - Halo or Gears, Microsoft and Xbox can only benefit by releasing those games there. All I'd say on this front is that unambiguous Game Pass launches for those titles has to be a given and if the pace of the multi-platform roll-out continues as is, I honestly think we need to see new Xbox hardware sooner rather than later. For another generation at least, the plug and play console has a big role to play.But this is a transitionary period and the pace of change has been quite astonishing. As John says in this week's Direct, if we go back just 12 months to November 2023, the idea of Microsoft embracing PlayStation development had no real credibility whatsoever. And yet just a couple of months later, Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and Matt Booty officially kicked off this transition in the Xbox business. Four games were mooted for PlayStation release, as an experiment - which always did seem like tuned messaging as opposed to a reveal of the full strategy.We're now at the point where key Microsoft Studios titles likeDiablo 4andCall of Duty Black Ops 6aren't just on PlayStation 5, they're enhanced forPS5 Pro. Indiana Jones on PlayStation? Yes, there's a relatively short delay, but I'd expect that to be another key waypoint in the transition to full, day and date multi-platform support. If every screen is to be an Xbox, that should include those attached to PlayStation consoles too - or the overall thrust of the marketing doesn't fully make sense.Bazzite - 'SteamOS' For Windows PC Handhelds - Is It A Game-Changer?Somehow unifying Windows and Xbox is a top priority for Microsoft - especially when Linux offerings like SteamOS and close relative Bazzite are offering a compelling alternative. This is for handhelds, but console-like PCs are equally compelling.Watch on YouTubeThat's my take on Microsoft's journey this year: moving away from the concept of exclusive games and consoles, instead concentrating on increasing revenue, growing the size of the business and - as Phil Spencer says - turning the Xbox experience on PC from ""good"" to ""great"", a massively important investment for the future. On that latter point, I feel there's a huge amount of work to do. Whatever Microsoft is planning with Xbox and Windows, an upgraded app would be the bare minimum. We should be looking at the migration of the entire, streamlined Xbox interface to Windows, taking care of driver updates and system software upgrades for the user and comprehensively addressing the PC platform's failings, perhaps with a revamped DirectX.It sounds challenging but it can be done. Remarkably, despite not running games natively, Linux is now becoming a genuine challenger to Windows for gaming: SteamOS and offshoot Bazzite retain PC-like features but provide a console-like experience that works, even managing to mitigate shader compilation stutter in a way that DirectX has yet to match. Steam Deck works as a platform and demonstrates that Linux could power an Xbox alternative in the console space, while posing challenges to Windows on desktop PCs.For all the commentary and speculation in this piece, I'm sure there are still pieces of the puzzle missing. Since January, the multi-platform strategy has evolved to where we are now and hints on hardware have been shared, but right now, anything beyond that is basically guesswork. There does seem to be a general direction of travel here, a gradual/phased reveal for the platform holder's plans for the console and PC space - and I'm genuinely fascinated to see what happens next, and just how and when the ""largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation"" is revealed.","What is an Xbox?

109,DF Weekly: Death Stranding's surprise Xbox port impresses on both Series X and S hardware,"In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we take a look at the surprise reveal of last week - a full Xbox Series X/S port of Kojima Productions'Death Stranding. Released on the same day asPS5 Pro- which may look provocative - the launch is exactly five years on from the launch of the original PS4/PS4 Pro version. That's the more likely explanation for the Xbox release: the chances are that whatever console exclusivity deal Kojima Production had expired, so the firm went ahead. And what a surprise it was: we had an email from505 Gamesand that seemed to be the extent of the marketing. The game is currently 50 percent off on the Xbox Store, meaning I bought it for just £17.49. That's amazing value for a genuinely superb game, assuming that the port is of sufficient quality. We have good news for you there: it's great.So, please bear in mind that this release came out of nowhere and Digital Foundry has plenty on its plate at the moment, so impressions on this one will be somewhat limited to just a morning of testing. However, despite the PlayStation origins of the Decima Engine and its prior console exclusivity, the truth is that Death Stranding on Xbox Series consoles is looking good, whether you're playing on the premium X console or the more cost-efficient S.DF Direct Weekly #188: Death Stranding Xbox, God of War Ragnarök PS5 Pro, Switch 2 Back Compat!Presented here for your embedded pleasure, DF Direct Weekly #188, with John Linneman, Rich Leadbetter and Alex Battaglia speaking into their microphones about the latest gaming and technology news.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:08News 1: God of War Ragnarök PS5 Pro patch tested!0:13:36News 2: Nintendo confirms Switch 2 backwards compatibility0:25:27News 3: Death Stranding lands on Xbox0:38:11News 4: No Man's Sky patched for PS5 Pro0:47:49News 5: Sony INZONE M10S impressions1:05:53News 6: Sonic Generations can run at 60fps on Switch1:11:42Supporter Q1: Will you use the 9800X3D for high-end gaming benchmarks?1:16:21Supporter Q2: Will PS6 use 3D V-Cache?1:17:32Supporter Q3: Will Alex and John switch to 9800X3D?1:22:15Supporter Q4: Why is Game Boost falling short of the promised 45 percent increase to PS5 Pro raster performance?1:29:21Supporter Q5: Would AI frame extrapolation make native frame-rate unimportant?1:32:30Supporter Q6: What do you want out of Steam Deck 2?1:38:32Supporter Q7: Why didn't you spend more time analysing the PS5 Pro's actual box?Kojima Productions' port is based on the Director's Cut, and it's good to see that all of the content and features from the PS5 release are available on the Xbox consoles. There are quality and performance modes (both targeting 60 frames per second) and the option to run in standard 16:9 or in 21:9 ultrawide with black borders top and bottom remains in place. Adding to the good news is that Xbox Series S is also feature complete. One might imagine that the game's PlayStation 4 origins makes the port less onerous for the Series S.Looking at the PS5 Director's Cut up against the new Series X version, we used the intro sequence running in quality modes as a benchmark of sorts. The cutscene begins as a 4K 60fps cinematic, but transitions mid-point into engine-driven rendering that can't quite sustain its target frame-rate. Both PlayStation and Xbox versions lose frames at similar points in the sequence, and while PS5 is generally a touch faster, there are moments where Series X can take point too. What we're seeing here amounts to a summary of cross-platform development across this generation - either machine can outperform the other, but generally they are very similar.In quality mode, PS5mayhave some kind of dynamic resolution scaling in effect across both axes, while Xbox scales horizontally for sure in a range between 3584x2160 to 3840x2160 based on the samples we have. Perhaps this explains the small performance differential. In performance mode, both consoles almost hit the target 60fps and both are use dynamic resolution scaling across both axes: the range seems to vary between 2880x1620 to 3200x1800. It should be noted that outside of the cinematics and intense combat, quality mode tends to hit 60fps, while performance mode almost runs at 60fps across the board. Where it doesn't, once again, PS5 and Series X trade blows, as the gallery below reveals.1of6CaptionAttributionXbox Series S is absolutely fascinating. It's an accomplished port that scales very, very well indeed to the junior console. The quality mode doesn't resolve as much detail and from the resolution metrics, we can see why - it's using a dynamic resolution scaling range between 900p and 1080p. What's quite remarkable here is that the drop to pixel count for the 4TF machine results in output frame-rate that's faster than the quality mode equivalents on Series X and PS5. And maybe that's a good thing, as the chances are the Series S owners are less likely to have VRR displays - so the closer it gets to a locked 60fps, the better.Meanwhile, performance mode is equally intriguing, running at a target 60fps with a DRS window that seems to sit within 810p to 900p. However, run the intro sequence in quality mode vs performance mode and it's fascinating to see just how close the metrics are - there's very little in it, which makes me wonder whether the performance mode could simply increase the DRS window to quality mode's upper bounds of 1080p.Quite how Kojima Productions has achieved a port of this quality isn't fully clear, but it's as good as I would have hoped for on Xbox consoles. Perhaps it's the case that the game's existing (and highly performant) PC version running on the DirectX 12 graphics API may have given the developers a strong foundation on which to deliver an Xbox version of the game. And right now, with the game available to buy at £17.49/$19.99, what you're looking at is a title that's still very different and original, still looks fantastic, runs beautifully and won't cost you the earth. Yes, we've only spent a very limited amount of time with the game, but the class of Kojima Productions is self-evident.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsFrom here, with console exclusivity a thing of the past, you have to wonder where Kojima Productions will go next. Obviously, there's a sequel in the offing (though what kind of exclusivity deal is in place remains to be seen) but of course, the smart money would be on some kind of port to Nintendo's upcoming Switch successor. The regular Digital Foundry audience may recall that I tested Death Stranding on a downclocked RTX 2050 mobile graphics chip, which represents the closest thing you'll get to the leakedSwitch 2T239 GPU specs. I was able to run the game at console equivalent settings at native 720p, using DLSS upscaling to hit both 1080p and 1440p - and it looked great. While the Xbox ports may look like a definitive end point for potential Death Stranding versions, I'd say that Switch 2 is absolutely a viable target.This has been an interesting diversion from the launch of the PlayStation 5 Pro last week, which - and let's be honest here - has been the focus of attention from Digital Foundry. And there's more of that in the Direct. John Linneman roadtests the new Pro patch for God of War:Ragnarök, which features the ability to swap between TAAU and PSSR upscaling at any point, opening the door to a fascinating comparison of the computational cost of PSSR up against the much 'cheaper' TAAU. Meanwhile, I took my PS5 Pro into my garage where my old 8K LG Nanocell TV sits gathering dust, looking to check outNo Man's Sky's excellent 8K 30fps mode.We also share our thoughts on the announcement of Switch 2 backwards compatibility with the existing Switch library, while John gets very, very excited about Sony's new Inzone M10S 1440p monitor with 480Hz and G-Sync support. We'll have a separate Eurogamer article about this in due course, but he reckons it's one of the most impressive displays he's ever seen. There's also some great discussion in our Supporter Q+A section. Will Alex upgrade to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D? Will John finally leave Intel behind for his next workstation? And when it comes to the next console unboxing, should we provide a technical analysis of the cardstock and materials used? Can we in any way elevate content that is essentially about removing a plastic box from a cardboard one? It's all in this week's DF Direct.

111,DF Weekly: Xbox's new 6nm processor emphasises the console price challenges to come,"""Series X 6nm! YESSSSSS! We found it!"" Not my words, but the excited exclamations ofAustin Evans, with a brand-new video that tears down the new disc-less edition of the Xbox Series X, revealing what's generally believed to be the first major console revision for Microsoft since 2020. It's an interesting contrast with Sony, who have revised the PlayStation 5 annually, moving to a 6nm processor way back in 2022 and delivering a further-revised 'Slim' edition a year later. 6nm silicon brings with it apparent cost-reductions and efficiency improvements - but this is no game-changing update in the way it was with the Xbox One S and the PS4 Slim. In concert with a $599 Xbox Series X 2TB, a $449 disc-less Series X and a $699PlayStation 5 Pro, the days of console cost-reductions are clearly over and the whole nature of what next-gen will actually be is up for debate.Going back to the Austin Evans video, the nature of the Series X revision is fully revealed. By moving from 7nm to 6nm, the chip itself is smaller. Evans is seen measuring the processor but doesn't offer a die-size. Having spoken to him, his measurements for the older chip don't meet the acknowledged 360mm2(it's more like 380mm2), but comparing his measurements for the new chip to the old, it's around 87 percent of the size. This would suggest a 6nm die-size of around 313mm2. Truth is, package size and die size can be slightly different, perhaps explaining the discrepancy in measurements. Even so, the size reduction is broadly in line with PS5's shrinkage, with similar, modest power consumption improvements up against the prior 7nm models.Thanks to this, Microsoft follows Sony in also reducing the quality of the cooling assembly. The impressive heft of the old cooler with its vapour chamber is swapped out for a more conventional design with copper heat pipes. While internal temperatures aren't measured in the Evans video, the end result is a console that basically looks very similar to the old one, and has a similarly quiet acoustic profile. Sony took the opportunity to build a new form-factor around its efficiency improvements, but Microsoft has not. Despite the emergence of the trash can-like,adorably all-digital Xbox Series Xin Microsoft's self-leaked FTC disclosures, it's clear that the current form-factor remains the same.DF Direct Weekly #185: Xbox Series 6nm Upgrade, Halo Battle Royale Cancellation, Analogue 3D Reveal!Allow us to present DF Direct Weekly #185 in this embedded format.

We're also asked why the power saving isn't more pronounced than PS5's, bearing in mind the larger chip. Well, on the latter point, PS5 and Series X at 7nm consumed similar power so it stands to reason it's the same situation at 6nm too. Microsoft's chip might be larger, but Sony's is pushed to higher clocks - on the GPU side at least.As for why it has taken Microsoft so long to shrink the Project Scarlett SoC, this moves us into the kind of economic decision-making nobody outside of the console manufacturers really has visibility on. We can only assume that these companies are not in the business of needlessly throwing money away and that the decision is sound. There are any number of reasonable theories that might fit: Microsoft may simply have had a larger stockpile of chips, for starters. We just don't know.The bigger story is the fact that outside of localised discounts, this particular mid generation cost reduction is not like any other before it. Moving the main processors to lower process nodes was a routine practise during the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, with many different revisions available. Both consoles went through three visible form-factor revisions, but the chips were improved even more frequently than that. PS4 and Xbox One? There was only one process reduction across the entire generation. The 2013-era 28nm process yielded to 2016's 16nmFF, offering huge efficiency improvements, striking form-factor revisions and opening the door to the mid-gen 'Pro' consoles: Xbox One X and PS4 Pro.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsCompare and contrast with the 7nm to 6nm transition: more a step than a leap, with no game-changing reductions to processor size, heat reduction or efficiency - more of a modest 'nice to have' series of improvements. Microsoft clearly 'did the maths' and realised that a mid-gen enhanced console was not a good idea. Sony, who already had more latitude thanks to PS5's smaller chip vs Series X, decided itwasworth doing - even if the end result is a $699 console. I'd still take it over a $599 Series X 2TB (even if it does have the disc drive the Pro lacks) but the latitude to make affordable console hardware is clearly not there if neither platform holder can actually make it. All of which asks serious questions of next-gen,a topic I've covered before.Enter ex-Sony CEO Shawn Layden,who reckonsthat the console arms race has now played out: ""It has plateaued. We're at the stage of hardware development that I call 'only dogs can hear the difference'. If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you’re not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal, you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things. We're fighting over teraflops and that's no place to be. We need to compete on content. Jacking up the specs of the box, I think we’ve reached the ceiling.""Many will agree with Layden - certainly the legions of PS4 and Xbox One owners who've felt no need to upgrade their consoles, based on the sparse numbers we have on Sony and Microsoft's player bases stacked up against their console sell-in numbers. However, this does stand in contrast to the rampant success of Nvidia in particular in the PC space, where the RTX stands triumphant and where the ray tracing and AI features of those products have clearly found an audience. RTX 40 series in particular has gained ground in a way that isn't compatible with our own expectations from the price-rises we saw there. It's particularly amazing to me to see that arguably the poorest value 40 series GPU - the 4060 Ti - sits proudly in fourth spot in the Steam Hardware Survey as of this writing.Where I concur with Layden is that content is always king - something proven out once again by Nintendo Switch - but new technology is a key enabler for fresh gaming experiences and I'd say that Nintendo agrees too, based on what we know of Switch's design. In fact, between Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Sony, MicrosoftandNintendo, it's clear that future innovation will be based on refinements to today's technology, augmented with more powerful RT and machine learning features. The direction of travel is essentially set in stone at this point, but delivering it at a palatable price-point is the key challenge.","""Series X 6nm! YESSSSSS! We found it!"" Not my words, but the excited exclamations of Austin Evans , with a brand-new video that tears down the new disc-less edition of the Xbox Series X, revealing what's generally believed to be the first major console revision for Microsoft since 2020. It's an interesting contrast with Sony, who have revised the PlayStation 5 annually, moving to a 6nm processor way back in 2022 and delivering a further-revised 'Slim' edition a year later. 6nm silicon brings with it apparent cost-reductions and efficiency improvements - but this is no game-changing update in the way it was with the Xbox One S and the PS4 Slim. In concert with a $599 Xbox Series X 2TB, a $449 disc-less Series X and a $699 PlayStation 5 Pro , the days of console cost-reductions are clearly over and the whole nature of what next-gen will actually be is up for debate.

112,"Until Dawn's PS5 remake scares - with bugs, image quality concerns and frame delivery issues","Ahead of itseventual theatrical release(andrumoured sequel), Sony has returned to the Canadian Rockies to remake 2015's interactive horror drama Until Dawn for PS5. Digital Foundry's own Canadian representative, Oliver Mackenzie, was given just 24 hours before the game's October 4th launch to test it out. Unfortunately, the game is on a shaky technical footing so far, despite some impressive elements in this surprisingly deep remake.Let's start, as Oliver did recounting his experiences on DF Direct Weekly #183, with the good stuff. Compared to the original PS4 version running on PS5, it's clear that there are some seismic upgrades in terms of character models, environments and even cinematography. The opening minutes of the game have been significantly expanded too, with new and reworked gameplay segments that replace previous quick-time event sequences and a new third-person camera that replaces the loosely tracked and fixed or semi-fixed shots in the original game.Until Dawn's core visual design has also seen a generational leap, as you'd expect from an early PS4 title transitioning to the now-mature PS5 using Unreal Engine 5, with higher-res graphics and effects, better lighting and skin rendering and a warmer colour tone. However, this fidelity upgrade isn't matched by improvements to performance, and the game has other issues too that call into question exactly how much QA time and polish the remake was afforded.DF Direct Weekly #183: Until Dawn Has Issues, Nintendo Ryujinx Takedown, UE5 MegaLights, FF16 Xbox?Here's the full DF Direct Weekly #183 experience, featuring Rich, Oliver and Alex.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:53News 1: Nintendo takes down Ryujinx0:17:28News 2: Until Dawn remake tested!0:33:20News 3: Unreal MegaLights tech demoed0:48:26News 4: Square Enix wants FF16 on Xbox0:57:39News 5: Next Guerrilla game reportedly Horizon online1:06:04News 6: God of War Ragnarök gets PC patch boosts1:14:02News 7: STALKER 2 documentary shows war torn game development1:22:20Supporter Q1: Was Strix Halo designed for a new Steam Machine?

Does it need to?1:42:34Supporter Q5: The PS5 Pro hasn’t sold out, so is this a sign of underperforming sales?Some of these issues are glaring but limited in scope. For example, the 2024 remake has significant frame pacing or frame ordering issues in its (admittedly few) pre-rendered cutscenes, making them look bad even if you're not exactly sure why. There's also a film grain effect enabled by default that updates extremely slowly - perhaps at one-sixth to one-quarter rate, or 10 to 15Hz - and is extremely coarse and ugly as a result. Thankfully, this can be disabled, but other issues are more deep-seated.The game's basic image quality, for example, isn't great. The internal resolution is typical for a recent Unreal Engine release on PS5, at around 1440p, but there's a huge amount of aliasing in spots like hair, fur and high-contrast edges in general. (Unfortunately, given the game's setting and lighting, you'reoftenlooking at hair, fur and high-contrast edges.) There's plenty of break-up whenever there's motion on screen too, which is a real shame.We mentioned performance issues in cutscenes earlier, and performance in live gameplay and in-engine cutscenes also has frame pacing problems, with highly variable frame-times above and below the customary 33ms. The game is also limited to 30fps, with no option for a higher update rate - which is understandable given the nature of the gameplay, but still disappointing given the PS5's signficant advantage in terms of GPU and particularly CPU resources versus the PS4. (ThePS5 Procould potentially be tapped for a 60fps Pro mode, as we saw in other games when we wenthands-on with the new console, so perhaps that's the plan here.)To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsGiven the nature of the game's issues, it's somewhat surprising to see that the game was remade at all, especially as Until Dawn remains quite playable on PS5 and the title generally holds up well despite its age. In fact, the 2015 release actually runs unlocked between 50 and 60fps in back-compat mode on PS5, making for a smoother experience than in the 2024 remake - despite the lower 1080p resolution.As Alex points out in the Direct, we wouldn't expect that too many of these remade assets would be reused in a sequel, but perhaps with Until Dawn movie in production Sony just wanted to have a modern version of the game available on its latest console and PC - and certainly having a UE5 codebase to build a potential sequel from would make sense too. Regardless of the reason for the remake though, the game's frame-rate delivery issues need to be solved.Of course, we didn't spent the full 108-minute duration of this week's DF Direct discussing Until Dawn. We also covered a range of other news topics, like Nintendo's take-down of the Ryujinx emulator, the release of the Unreal MegaLights tech demo and improvements toGod of War Ragnarökfollowing a recent patch, amongst other items and supporter questions.If you'd like to support Digital Foundry, see what we're up to ahead of time and ask questions we can answer in the Direct - including insights intoSwitch 2and PS5 Pro in this week's edition - then you can do sovia Patreon.","Ahead of its eventual theatrical release (and rumoured sequel ), Sony has returned to the Canadian Rockies to remake 2015's interactive horror drama Until Dawn for PS5.

113,Where's our Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review?,"Hello! It's that time again. You might've seen a few reviews going live right about now for theDiablo 4: Vessel of Hatred expansion, but unfortunately not one from us (or from our friends atVG247andRock Paper Shotgun).As ever, the usual caveats apply here: we mean it when we say with each of these cases that we are absolutely not entitled to review code; it's a privilege, not a right. Ultimately which outlets get review code and when is entirely at the discrection of the publisher - it's their game, and it's totally their decision as to how they handle advanced access to it.That said, we also have a duty to keep our readers in the loop. In this case, it's that we actually did receive code earlier this week (unlike our sister sites). Only, we were told that code wouldn't provide access until launch day, this coming 8th October. And then subsequently, and slightly oddly, that review actually code wouldn't go out until Monday 7th.It's all a bit odd. But hey, that's video games - and ultimately, no big deal. The good news is that we will of course get access to the game at some point, and when we do you can expect our in-depth thoughts as ever (just a bit later than we'd hoped).Until then, you can check out or originalDiablo 4 reviewfrom last summer, where we gave it four stars and I described it as ""a designer's game at heart, built on intricacy and depth,"" only one where ""a sense of fearful overcompensation holds it back."" Or, we've our many in-depthDiablo 4 guides, and also Alexis' exceptional writing onher experiences with the first post-launch season, Season of the Malignant, and at the same time the wider system of service games as a whole. She described it like this:""That I mindlessly power through my silly little video game chores against some of the most beautifully-lit landscapes in the series is a disservice to the environment artists who worked on this for years. Diablo 4 doesn't have to be like this, but truth be told, I am weak and lazy, and the mindless hum of busywork has become a frighteningly easy form of procrastination from actual work.""There's a whole decade, at least, of Diablo 4 lined up and waiting for us. But I can't see a future where the long-term player experience gets better without a fundamental change to the way we engage with live-service games, as well as the way live-service games act coy about the compulsive psychology embedded in their design. This may be the most beautiful rendering of Sanctuary yet, but in true human fashion, it's become a hell of my own making.""Since then, some substantial changes have been made to Diablo 4 - we're looking forward to checking them out!","Hello!

115,How PlayStation 5 Pro lays the groundwork for PS6 and beyond,"A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, morePlayStation 5 Pro. However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact,we've made the argument ourselves. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of why Sony has taken a different route and perhaps more of the strategy is now understandable.Before we get into that though, I wanted to highlight an astute point made by one of our backers of the DF Supporter Program. If you're invested in the PlayStation platform, if you're going to skip PS5 Pro but will likely get a PS6, the arrival of an enhanced machine is likely very good news for you.Let's rewind to the launch of Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. A fundamental aspect of their appeal was the fact that your existing library of games would carry forward to the new hardware. Microsoft made their plans clear to fans, but the message from PlayStation was confused - and yet, ultimately, PS5 back-compat worked almost as well as the Xbox equivalent. The continuity in game libraries from one generation to the next made the idea of switching platforms a difficult sell,something Phil Spencer himself pointed out.DF Direct Weekly #182: Ghost of Yōtei, Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster, New PS5 Pro Titles RevealedPresented and embedded for the purposes of audio-visual joy, here is DF Direct Weekly #182.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:16News 1: Sony reveals new games in State of Play0:14:04News 2: Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered analysed0:33:17News 3: New PS5 Pro Enhanced titles announced0:44:48News 4: Assassin's Creed Shadows delayed0:55:07News 5: Dragon's Dogma 2: how is patch 9 on PS5?1:00:44News 6: Monster Hunter PC specs spark concern1:14:01News 7: RTX 5080, 5090 specs reportedly leaked1:35:52Supporter Q1: Should console generations be extended further?1:42:44Supporter Q2: Will the upcoming Microsoft handheld rely on FSR 4?1:45:57Supporter Q3: Would the Series S/X divide be fine if the S came with more memory?1:53:47Supporter Q4: Is there a difference between analysing provided footage and footage you captured yourself?""We lost the worst generation to lose in the Xbox One generation, where everybody built their digital library of games,"" he said. ""I see a lot of pundits out there who want to go back to the time when we all had cartridges and discs, and every new generation was a clean slate, and you could switch the whole console share. That's just not the world we are in today.""Another point of commonality between PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X was that their backwards compatibility prioritised support for their mid generation console upgrades. PS5 ran PS4 Pro games, while Series X opted for the One X codepath. At a stroke, owners of the new consoles designed for 4K displays had access to great-looking software that often presented with very impressive upgrades over the base equivalents. Not only that, the extra horsepower of the new hardware was brought to bear on those older games - more stable performance and increased quality in games with dynamic resolution scaling and unlocked frame-rates.One can imagine that the same thing will happen again with PlayStation 6 - it will take all of the upgrades from PS5 Pro and offer the same kind of cumulative improvements. Well, we would hope so. The idea does rely somewhat on a robust form of back compat that allows for all the power of the new machine to be deployed on old games - so taking a look at PS5 Pro's 'Game Boost' mode for older titles is going to be indicative of whether this is possible. If you're wondering why there's doubt here, PS4 Pro's boost mode was only a small improvement, while PS5 mirrored certain elements of PS4 Pro's architecture, which may have made enhanced performance more easy to attain. PS5 Pro does not have as many commonalities. First order of business will be to testElden Ring, which has unlocked frame-rates across all modes: if the boosts are in line with the 45 percent increase in performance mooted by Sony for its GPU, it makes the chances of future PlayStation hardware being able to do likewise more viable.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThat's one aspect of how a PS5 Pro may benefit people who aren't actually going to buy the console - better versions of the games you own in the years to come - but now we need to look at the overall strategic advantages for Sony. On the face of it, the idea of releasing a £699/$699 console doesn't sound like a particularly good idea, after all. However, the Pro innovates in the console space in a way that is essential for the hardware to come. The combination of CPU and GPU is now joined by machine learning silicon.PS5 Pro has demonstrated that the opportunities to increase console performance and features by simply producing faster, more complex CPUs and GPUs is now over. For a $100 price premium, Sony doubled the size of the PS4 GPU in making PS4 Pro. Today, with PS5 Pro, a $250 price premium (over the equivalent digital base model) cannot do the same. Sony is achieving similar, if not outright superior results, by adding machine learning silicon and amplifying graphics via AI hardware. It has also allowed Sony to add in enhanced ray tracing capabilities into what must surely have been a very tight silicon budget.I can tell you right now that whatever consoles come from Sony and indeed Microsoft next, they will be following a similar strategy at the base architectural level. Cost per transistor is not what it was, and with consoles more than any other gaming devices, silicon costs are crucial. Gigantic increases in the size of the GPU especially are unlikely to happen, but with AI, we're only just beginning. As proven time and time again by Nvidia's innovations in the space, machine learning hardware offers a gigantic return on investment - but getting to where Nvidia is now requires two things: investment and patience.How PS5 Pro Improves PlayStation 6 Backwards CompatibilityA question from one of the backers of the DF Supporter Program prompted this article.Watch on YouTubeLooking at the criticisms of PS5 Pro today, I am reminded of the massive backlash against Nvidia's RTX 20-series products based on the Turing architecture back in 2018. The products were pricey, nobody bought into the AI narrative, ray tracing was derided. And yet today, DLSS upscaling has proven to be one of the most transformative technologies in the PC space - a desired feature for users and coveted by the competition. Ray tracing? With smart technological innovations, an immense level of investment in software likeReSTIRand strategic partnerships with key game makers, Nvidia brought actual path tracing to triple-A games.None of this happened overnight and yet Nvidia has now effectively defined the direction of travel for graphics innovation and consoles need to catch up. And that's where PS5 Pro comes in. Sony has taken the smart path here, delivering the custom silicon required where AMD did not seem to have any, while at the same time developing PlayStation Spectral Resolution (PSSR) on the software side. We've now been 'eyes on' with PSSR across a range of games and while there's still work to be done in improving it, it's a big leap beyond existing upscaling solutions. But we shouldn't forget that the machine learning hardware isn't just a fixed function AI upscaling block - it can be used for all manner of tasks. PSSR delivers the biggest bang for the buck, but it's just the beginning.We are looking at such a big change here that absolutely we should be looking at PlayStation 5 Pro as the console that sets the ball rolling for Sony in an area of crucial importance. I'd even venture to suggest that PlayStation 6 may evenneedPlayStation 5 Pro to exist for this evolution to happen. Sony's technology groups need time to develop technologies like PSSR and to ship them and to refine them. Meanwhile, developers need to grow accustomed to these technologies instead of simply focusing on them for their PC games.PlayStation 5 Pro Hands-On: 11 Games Tested, PSSR and RT Upgrades Revealed, Developers Interviewed!Our thoughts on PS5 Pro came into focus after going hands-on with 11 titles - an experience we attempt to articulate in this video.Watch on YouTubeSony is obviously not alone in these endeavours.Switch 2will ship in 2025 with RT and machine learning silicon in itsT239 processorand unlike Sony, Nintendo has the benefit of tapping into Nvidia's existing technologies. And then there's Microsoft. Xbox president Sarah Bond has talked about gen 10 delivering ""the biggest technological leap ever in a generation"" and I'd put good money on this referring to machine learning-based technologies as opposed to a wallet-busting gigantor-class GPU.We've already seenMicrosoft's Auto SR upscalercome out of nowhere and in putting together our coverage, I was surprised at Microsoft's willingness to talk to us about it and there were some follow-up conversations after we went live with it. Auto SR is impressive within its limits, but it's easy to imagine that a more robust DLSS-like solution is in development for future hardware too (Auto SR as-is could be deployed for back compat though).Going back to PS5 Pro though, we've now seen enough of the machine to say with some level of conviction that it does what Sony says it does - but more than that, with titles likeF1 24, there's evidence that those that target the hardware specifically will see much bigger boosts than simply 'fidelity mode at 60fps'. PS5 Pro doesn't answer the value question conclusively - not yet - but it's delivering clearly superior results to base hardware. More holistically though, today's added enhancements may well be laying the foundation work for the viability of 10th generation console hardware - and in that sense, its importance shouldn't be underestimated.","A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro .

116,DF Weekly: the Switch 2 hardware leak is almost certainly real - so what have we learned?,"The anticipation for the NintendoSwitch 2- or whatever it ends up being called - is reaching levels of mania I didn't quite anticipate, but a major leak last week of what appear to be prototype components gives us our first hard evidence of what form the machine may actually take, while hinting at the components within.So, what have we got? Essentially, there are a number of factors to consider. First of all, there has been the relentless and quite remarkable pursuit of Switch 2 facts and rumours from the members ofthe Famiboard forums, who have chased down every leak and compiled a compelling and almost complete specification. Thanks to tracking shipping manifests out of Taiwan, they have discovered a lot about the technical make-up of Nintendo's next generation hardware right down to the component level. It's because of this information that it can be determined that the leak last week is genuine - or at least as accurate as an old prototype dating from October 2023 can be.The eight-inch LCD. The larger form factor. The new Joycons connecting via magnetic rails. At this point we can assume it's all true. Following up on the leak came a very interesting video fromXiao Ning Zi, who appears to have had access to the same CAD modelling info as last week's leaker and has gone on to print out a model, which the channel has then compared to the OLED model, showing how substantially larger it is. The channel also makes performance claims, but much of this is not backed up by any visible sourcing - and I note several clips from the video that come from my own T239 video from earlier in the year.DF Direct Weekly #181: Major Switch 2 Leak, Intel vs AMD for PS6, FSR 4 Using AI, Days Gone RemasterMay I present to you DF Direct Weekly #181, with the Switch 2 hardware leak front and centre in this episode.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:08News 1: Switch 2 hardware revealed in apparent leak0:23:07News 2: Dragon's Dogma 2 patch boosts PC performance0:33:04News 3: Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster tested0:44:34News 4: RDNA 4 skips high-end GPUs, FSR 4 to be AI-based1:00:40News 5: Intel, AMD battled over PS6 contract1:07:32News 6: Horizon, Days Gone remasters rumoured1:17:50News 7: John gets a Virtual Boy!1:27:12Supporter Q1: How does Sony deliver consistently good PC ports?1:32:51Supporter Q2: What do you make of Nintendo suing for Palworld's alleged patent violations?1:38:25Supporter Q3: Would you expect to see a big difference between FSR 2 and PSSR on Pro titles?

Switch 2 has twin USB-C ports top and bottom (Xiao Ning Zi suggests the top one may be for peripherals including an external camera, while our own John Linneman suggests a use-case for charging while in table-top play). It'll also have a Micro-SD card slot - and we'd hope it supports the latest and greatest formats to allow for bandwidth-heavy games to run. Otherwise you're reliant on the 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage contained therein. Cartridges are supported too, with strong hints that original Switch media is also supported.The fact that we're getting an internal view of the Switch 2 is also highly revealing. The mainboard - shown without any of the chips mounted - gives us some idea of the architecture within. There are two pads for the 6GB LPDDRX 7500MT/s memory modules to sit on, giving us 12GB of RAM in total. A 128-bit memory interface offers up a maximum of 102GB/s of bandwidth, assuming Nintendo runs the RAM at full speed. Next to that is the area on which the highly contentious SoC sits - and therein the controversy heats up. Does the size of the area occupied by the SoC package give us any hints as to the technology used to make the chip?The existence of Nintendo's T239 processor was first revealed by renowned leakerkopite7kimi, way back in 2021. He called it a customised version of the T234 chip created by Nvidia for its automotive endeavours and also for its latest Jetson Orin NX kits. However, the links between T234 and T239 need to be brought into question. Since the publication of myT239 piece, sources have come forward to suggest that one is not derived from the other and that they were not developed by the same team. T239 is entirely custom for Nintendo, butisusing RTX 30-series Ampere-architecture GPU cores with some RTX 40-series power saving and media features. The CPU is entirely different and it has a custom file decompression block for super-fast loading and data processing.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe controversy comes from the process node technology used to make T239 - crucial information which has still not leaked. Speaking toDF Supporter Programmembers on our Discord, I shared an image I generated in Photoshop which extrapolates the mainboard view into a top-down perspective. Despite the disclaimers I added, this image ended up on Reddit and from there, further theory-crafting emerged. The memory modules are 14mm by 14mm, so if we know how large T239 is (by comparing the SoC area to the memory area), we should be able to getsomeidea of the size of the chip andmaybethe process node it is using. And that could be somewhat crucial, as the leaked prototype image shows a relatively small battery bay. Acknowledged handheld expertCary Golomb noticed the same thing- since battery life is king, something has to give, and that would be performance.The concept of an 8nm T239 is reluctantly understood by some to be a likely candidate for Switch 2 - which would be unfortunate, as it's an old node at this point that is hardly power efficient. The automotive T234 is actually 455mm2(!) which many believe rules it out completely as even a cut-back version would be too large, whileJetson power estimatorssuggest consumption that would never work on a handheld device. That said, a 2560 CUDA core RTX 3050 on the same node is around 200mm2, so a Switch 2 chip with 1536 CUDA cores would occupy around 60 percent of the space - enough area remaining for the ARM CPU cores and other 'uncore' components. The package size on the mainboard could accommodate that, but then again, it could accommodate any of the viable nodes.Does the Jetson power estimator completely rule out an 8nm handheld? The evidence looks compelling, but the T234 chip is built by a different team for an entirely different application and it's also a vast 455mm2processor. T239 will be a far smaller processor that would have been built for Nintendo with handheld play in mind, designed specifically for the process node it uses - whatever that is. If 8nm was the target, the designers would have to work with that. Comparisons between T239 and T234 may be less relevant than expected, so power calculations from the estimator may not apply, especially as power-saving features from later Nvidia technology have been added.Inside Nvidia's New T239 Processor: The Next-Gen Tegra For Switch 2?A while back, we used a heavily downclocked RTX 2050 to give some idea of what Nvidia hardware similar to the T239 can actually achieve. Highly theoretical but the results were impressive.Watch on YouTubeAn alternative train of thought is that - and this would be a first - Nintendo is using the same TSMC '4nm' node used for the RTX 40-series graphics cards. This is actually a 5nm process, renamed by Nvidia and TSMC, presumably for marketing reasons. This would deliver incredible efficiency, fast clocks and tiny die area. But it is still a relatively recent process and we have to go all the way back to 2005's Xbox 360 to see a console maker use the latest chip fabrication technology.Typically console makers 'wait their turn' for this kind of technology (5nm is still in demand) and historically, Nintendo has used this to its advantage with the second generation 'Mariko' Switch that vastly improved battery life and made the smaller, Switch Lite possible. It may make sense for Nintendo to wait for a 4nm refresh - it would be much cheaper and more impactful further on in the Switch 2's life cycle.But the more you think about 4nm in the here and now, the more questions arise. If T239 was designed for 4nm, why not use the RTX 40-series Ada Lovelace GPU architecture to begin with? I'd also start wondering why Switch 2 is so much larger than its predecessor, bearing in mind that 4nm is incredibly efficient. The obvious explanation is that the new console is larger because it needs to dissipate more heat and I would expect a smaller unit based on this technology. So what are the alternatives? Chances are that the mainboard we've seen could house an 8nm processor, but just how slow would it run? Occam's Razor, therefore, would suggest that the 6nm used by PS5 would be a better fit and it is available at a reasonable price for Nintendo - but Nintendo doesn't have a history of sticking to 'the rules' or using the most plausible technology.Another theory is that Switch 2 is so large to accommodate a 1080p screen, as opposed to housing a larger main processor. However, what the visualisations we've seen fail to communicate well is that there's actually a sizeable bezel around the display, similar to the original Switch. If housing the eight-inch display is the reason for the larger handheld, I'm not sure it needs to bethatbig... unless the screen is actually larger. Heat dissipation still seems like the more plausible explanation then, suggesting a more realistic choice of process node.【全网独家爆料】Switch 2 来了！你想知道的一切全在这里！We enjoyed this video, where leaked CAD models for Switch 2 were used to 3D print a facsimile, which was then compared to other handhelds such as the OG Switch, Steam Deck and PlayStation Portal.Watch on YouTubeBeyond that, historically, for Nintendo, price is everything. Similar to the original Switch - which also shipped on a less than ideal process - Switch 2 may well sit on 8nm.Original leaker kopite7kimi believes so- and maybe Nvidia and Nintendo may have arranged a 'sweetheart' deal with Samsung for this process, as opposed to the more logical 6nm alternative.Truth is, we don't know, but the thing about anticipation is that wealwayswant the product to be the best it can possibly be and the unfortunate truth is that there is precedent for over-estimating the capabilities of new Nintendo hardware with each and every generation from the Wii onwards, even though Nintendo has proven time and time again that it doesn't need the best possible tech. Even with Switch, few believed that Nintendo would use a vanilla Tegra X1, residing on the failed 20nm process. Tegra X2 on 16nm with double the bandwidth would have been a far better fit, yet TX1 it was.Ultimately, we need to accept that Nintendo and Nvidia know what they are doing. Despite the limitations of Tegra X1 and a mostly awful showing on the Shield Android TV mini-console, Switch went on to become a phenomenal success and while games can clearly suffer from the limitations of the hardware (particularly the bandwidth situation that TX2 would have vastly improved), we've dined out on seven years worth of excellent releases, including an array of titles we'd never have believed possible on 2015-era mobile technology.And now Nintendo faces the biggest challenge of all - somehow following that up.","The anticipation for the Nintendo Switch 2 - or whatever it ends up being called - is reaching levels of mania I didn't quite anticipate, but a major leak last week of what appear to be prototype components gives us our first hard evidence of what form the machine may actually take, while hinting at the components within.

117,DF Weekly: PS5 Pro's PSSR AI upscaling could be a game-changer,"A new DF Direct Weekly arrives today and it's essentially two hours of myself, Oliver Mackenzie and Alex Battaglia revisiting the Mark Cerny reveal forPlayStation 5 Proin the light of broadcast quality footage made available to the press after the event. It's a chance to reassess the introduction of the new hardware by being able to actually see the difference, with the blurry haze of YouTube compression artefacts removed from the presentation. In the process, we've learned more about the games shown and have some initial opinions about PSSR - PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution - the new AI upscaling technology used by PS5 Pro. Think of it as Sony's take on Nvidia's game-changing DLSS.Of course, we've made a YouTube video about it embedded on this page and by extension, the audience might be wondering how we can show you the games running well on this medium if prior YT presentations could not. Well, we've been doing this for some time now and recognise that there's a limited amount of video bandwidth available - and you can get more from that bitrate budget by slowing footage down, freezing it and zooming it for extra clarity. This is particularly useful for users on mobile devices - well over half of our views the last time we looked and only growing in importance. Still not good enough for you? Well, this Direct and the Cerny presentation are available as pristine quality video downloads via theDigital Foundry Supporter Program.The majority of titles seen in the Sony presentation last week are using PSSR upscaling and it turns out that 'countable pixel edges' - which we use to calculate internal rendering resolutions - are very easy to find, meaning we have a pretty firm lock on the details. It was somewhat disappointing to see newcomers to the DF Supporter Program share those details this weekend ahead of the show's public release and with none of the surrounding, crucial context.DF Direct Weekly #180: The PS5 Pro Breakdown: GT7, TLOUp2, Ratchet, Horizon, Alan Wake 2 + More!DF Direct Weekly #180 sees the team returning to Mark Cerny's PS5 Pro presentation, this time armed with broadcast quality grade footage.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:02:47The Last of Us Part 20:11:49Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart0:23:44Alan Wake 20:33:27Horizon Forbidden West0:39:09Hogwarts Legacy0:45:48Gran Turismo 70:54:35Dragon’s Dogma 2 and Assassin's Creed Shadows0:57:43Could PS5 Pro run Elden Ring at 60fps?1:03:36Is PS5 Pro a good deal relative to PC?1:16:48Supporter Q1: With the Pro reaching $700, what will the PS6 look like?1:26:42Supporter Q2: Could PSSR run on the base PS5?1:33:04Supporter Q3: Why hasn't Sony developed machine learning based frame gen tech for PS5 Pro?1:37:11Supporter Q4: Will the high price of PS5 Pro drive people to PC?1:44:13Supporter Q5: Will low PS5 Pro sales cause development problems?1:51:46Supporter Q6: What game reveals would have excited you about PS5 Pro?But hey - let's give you those rendering resolutions andthenallow me to explain perhaps why the developers have made those choices and why it's important to consider the overall presentation, not the internal pixel counts alone.The Last of Us Part 2:The clip shown in the presentation operates at the same native 1440p rendering resolution as the performance mode in the standard PS5 game. However, PSSR is used instead of a more basic upscale, giving a presentation comparable with native 4K. Why didn'tNaughty Dogincrease resolution? Well, PSSR has a computational cost on its own, while various elements such as post-processing are likely running at native 4K resolution.Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart:The footage looks to show much the same visual feature set as the existing Performance RT mode. However, internally rendering resolution varies between 1440p and 1800p, with a pass of PSSR to deliver a 4K output.Alan Wake 2:There isn't much video here, but there are clearly 30fps and 60fps modes, targeting 1260p and 864p respectively. Again, as the footage was easily countable, we're confident this is using PSSR. Screen-space reflections are evident in the 60fps mode, but they are not in 30fps, suggesting RT may be in play.Gran Turismo 7:Adding quarter res (1080p) ray-traced reflections in gameplay has a hit on GPU performance, so internal resolution drops in the clips seen to 1188p and - again - PSSR upscaling is used for a 4K output.In terms of the rest of the presentation, we countedAssassin's Creed Shadowsat 864p, targeting 60 frames per second, while there are no signs at all of PSSR present in the upgradedHorizon Forbidden West. I'm reminded of Guerrilla rolling its own checkerboard solution for PS4 Pro, as opposed to using the hardware.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsPutting aside the caveat that these games may not be final - and that the upgrades may be lower resource retrofit patches as opposed to from-the-ground-up PS5 Pro implementations, it's important to understand exactly what Mark Cerny's 'Big Three' enhancements are supposed to achieve. PS5 Pro receives extra GPU horsepower, enhanced ray tracing capabilities and machine learning capabilities. The idea is for the Big Three to work in tandem, delivering superior quality visuals from a more holistic standpoint. Internal resolution is only one element of overall image quality and PSSR is already showing some promise, delivering results that diminish the importance of the base pixel count.I can understand why some users may find some of the numbers above alarming. It's not necessarily true of Sony's first-party efforts, but many games are running at low resolutions on the standard PlayStation 5, with FSR 2 upscaling pushed too far in attempting to hit 1440p or 4K outputs. However, already we can see that the upscaling quality of PSSR lacks many of the profound issues we've noted when FSR 2 is running at very low resolutions. It's early days, it's not perfect, but there's grounds for optimism.Based on our testing,Alan Wake 2runs at 864p internal resolution on PlayStation 5 Pro in the 60fps clip, while the equivalent base PS5 mode operates at 847p. Firstly, we can safely assume that in transitioning from FSR 2 upscaling to PSSR, we will see a substantial quality upgrade. However, perhaps more important is to consider what Remedy will be doing with the Pro's extra resources in increasing qualityelsewherebecause obviously, the extra GPU horsepower in the Big Three is going to be used for features that Remedy prefers over simply increasing resolution. This is basic commonsense.PS5 Pro Reveal Reaction - Tech, Specs, Games, Price - A DF Direct SpecialIn case you missed it, here's our initial reaction to the PS5 Pro reveal - addressing a number of other points.Watch on YouTubeThe key question remaining is how good PSSR actually is. What this week's DF Direct Weekly shows - particularly in the Ratchet and Clank footage, where we can compare to other upscaling solutions - is that Sony has made an interesting start and the fundamentals are in place, but this is still very much an emerging technology. The crucial success is that at similar resolutions, PSSR possesses fewer of the distracting artefacts that blights FSR 2 presentations that are pushed beyond their comfort level. Problems in motion in particular are far less pronounced. However, PSSR is still a nascent technology for Sony - and I would not be surprised at all if this is a proving ground for PS6. As you'll see in the Ratchet segment in this week's Direct, PSSR has some way to go before it matches DLSS - but that's just one game, of course, and similar to other upscaling technologies, we should expect to see results of various quality on a per-implementation basis.The paradigm has been shifting for a long time now from quantity of pixels to quality of pixels and in bringing machine learning-based upscaling to consoles for the first time, PSSR allows developers to spend more system resources on how good a game can look as opposed to how high the resolution is. Now, don't get me wrong, upscaling quality does tend to improve the higher the base resolution - but it's down to developers now to choose the best balance for their games. Should they go for a 1080p presentation richer in detail, or a higher resolution 1440p alternative? Developers will need to make that call - but ultimately, it's all about the quality of the final presentation. The flexibility of machine learning-based upscaling means that 'how good the game looks' takes precedence over 'how high the pixel count is'.Just to be clear then: if a game runs at a 'low' resolution on PS5, and an equally 'low' resolution on PS5 Pro, they are not the same thing. Improved upscaling makes a difference, but bearing in mind the extra horsepower of the Pro, we can imagine that the developers are doing more with those pixels. The extent to which this is going to be successful is ultimately down to a more subjective assessment of the presentation for each title - and that's what we'll be looking at once software arrives for review. In the meantime, enjoy this Direct and look forward to more PS5 Pro coverage.","A new DF Direct Weekly arrives today and it's essentially two hours of myself, Oliver Mackenzie and Alex Battaglia revisiting the Mark Cerny reveal for PlayStation 5 Pro in the light of broadcast quality footage made available to the press after the event.

118,DF Weekly: PlayStation 5 Pro is incoming - so how should Sony market its premium console?,"PlayStation's 30th anniversary celebrations kicked off last week - and in a somewhat unexpected way. Key art on the PlayStation Blog showed a range of Sony hardware old and new in the background and carefully tucked away was a console we hadn't seen before. Or rather, wehadseen it before, but only via a sketch frombillbil-kun. This looks to be our first look atPlayStation 5 Proand now it's been confirmed that PlayStation lead system architect Mark Cerny hasa technical presentationto give tomorrow. Thisshouldbe our first indication ofhowSony aims to position PS5 Pro and to justify its existence.Documentation leaks from Sony's developer portal already tell us what to expect from the hardware. The Zen 2 CPU remains unchanged, but has an optional ten percent clock speed boost. The GPU moves from RDNA 2 architecture to RDNA 3, with the base unit's 36 compute units rising to 60 in the new machine. Without tapping into new features, Sony suggests that PS5 games will run around 45 percent faster on Pro compared to the standard model. However, machine learning silicon rated for 300 TOPs opens the door to PSSR upscaling - which we would hope to match the quality of Intel XeSS and maybe knock on the door of Nvidia DLSS. Ray tracing hardware is also beefed up, while the audio Tempest Engine of the standard PS5 also gains more performance on Pro.What does this mean for actual games? ML-based upscaling comprehensively bests the software-based solutions on PS5 right now. Games will run at higher resolutions and higher frame-rates, while PSSR improves upscaling quality, giving it a further boost over the existing model. Games with RT effects can runmoreRT effects while titles without RT features can now run with them. And even if a game has no Pro support at all, an 'ultra boost' mode should see that 45 percent of extra GPU power brought to bear. deliveing higher resolutions in games where that is dynamic, and higher frame-rates too. Where we won't see too much of a difference is in CPU-limited scenarios - of which there are many.DF Direct Weekly #179: Sony's PS5 Pro Tease, Concord Servers Close, RTX 5080 Perf Leak, Astro Bot!Here's the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly, where PS5 Pro discussion once again takes the lead story slot.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:41News 1: Sony leaks PS5 Pro design0:13:42News 2: Concord pulled from sale, servers close0:37:11News 3: Astro Bot review reaction!0:53:23News 4: RTX 5000 series performance and power rumoured1:05:51News 5: Bloodborne PC progresses1:14:53News 6: John’s Windows handheld impressions!1:27:04Supporter Q1: What should we make of the closure of AnandTech?1:39:09Supporter Q2: Where will Microsoft be in 15 years?1:46:14Supporter Q3: Could an RTX 6090 equipped Xbox explain Microsoft’s largest generational leap claims?1:52:44Supporter Q4: Could Ridge Racer make a return in the near future?1:57:58Supporter Q5: If Alan Wake 2 isn’t profitable, what hope do other original single player games have?2:03:28Supporter Q6: Will we really see ray tracing on Switch 2?However, the question is, how does Sony sell that to the audience? We talk about this in the latest DF Direct and suggest that Mark Cerny has a gift for articulating Sony's vision for the future of gaming technology and a technical presentation would be a great way to introduce the console. Now it seems almost certain that this is what's going to happen within 24 hours. However, we're told the presentation is just nine minutes long - not enough to dive deeply into the decisions made in creating the new console, nor what the hardware is truly capable of.Justifying a premium machine isn't a new challenge, of course, and Sony has done it before with PS4 Pro. The emphasis there was on addressing the new features brought about by 4K displays: ultra HD resolution and HDR. However, nobody really cares about 8K screens this time around. Not even me, and I owned a 75-inch LG Nanocell 8K screen for four years before 'downgrading' to a 77-inch 4K OLED. Instead, Sony has to sell the advantages of a generally more powerful machine, while at the same timenotmaking the existing machine look unduly poor.While I'm not sure how Mark Cerny can articulate this in nine minutes, I would expect Sony to more broadly emphasise the successes of the base PlayStation 5 and then to position the PS5 Pro as a more premium experience. Similar to PS4 Pro's marketing, we'll be assured that both pieces of hardware are part of the same family running the same games with the same basic features, and that PS5 Pro is essentially the same but better, perhaps with a sprinkling of AI magic.Beyond the initial Cerny introduction, the games have to do the talking. Laying out the specs of the new machine is one thing, but it's the way that all of the key components work in tandem that's key. PS5 Pro is much more than the sum of its parts and perhaps some kind of showcase in the vein of Microsoft's Developer_Direct would be the best way forward in showing the hardware at its best. Sony certainly has the first-party studio talent to put on an excellent show.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsI would expect to see a demonstration of the enhanced ray tracing capabilities compared to existing, shipped games - but perhaps more revelatory will be real world examples of the PSSR upscaling technology. The standard has been set by Nvidia's DLSS, but the potential here for PS5 Pro is immense. Games can run at higher resolutions than the base PS5, but if PSSR lives up to expectations, even lower resolutions should look better - as mad as that may sound. Looking at the Nixxes port ofHorizon Forbidden West, when we compared DLSS 1440p performance mode (internal resolution: 720p) to PS5's 1800p checkerboard (internal resolution: 1600x1800 effective), DLSS could lookbetterdespite operating with just a third of the base resolution.To a certain degree, machine learning-based upscaling frees up the GPU to do much more than just painting pixels - and it's this kind of shift from raw hardware to hybrid software/hardware solutions that compensates for the fact that cost-per-transistor in today's processors isn't reducing at anything like the same rate as prior generations. What this also means is that the role of machine learning is going to evolve beyond upscaling alone: Sony can repurpose the hardware to do much more in the fullness of time and may indeed have proof of concept demos to show us. Nvidia has blazed the trail here with ray reconstruction and frame generation but Sony may have its own ideas on how to use the new hardware.However, we cannot ignore the twin elephants in the room: pricing and positioning. Does a Pro PS5 diminish the existing 'amateur' model? I don't think so. Whether it's smartphones, gaming hardware or just about any other form of consumer electronics, the market is conditioned to the idea of paying more to get more - a description that fits PS5 Pro to a tee. This is not the core product, it's a premium offshoot for those who want more - and all developers will be aware that they still have to deliver an excellent experience for the vast majority of owners still on the standard machine. For those who want shinier graphics, crisper visuals and smoother frame-rates, the Pro is there for them.PlayStation 5 Pro Specs Confirmed, Analysis + New Information - A DF Direct SpecialFlash back to March this year, where the DF team assembled to discuss the detailed leaks that had emerged of the PS5 Pro's core specifications.Watch on YouTubeAdditionally, we shouldn't see this launch as anything more than a lower volume console aimed at a niche. I don't think we should view PS5 Pro as any kind of high-end PC competitor, nor any attempt to expand the reach of PlayStation beyond the existing audience. It's a machine designed for the more discerning console player with income to spare. For all of its strengths, the chances of the Pro delivering the kind of high frame-rate experiences high-end PC users crave are minimal owing to its lacklustre increases to CPU performance.It's a different kind of proposition to a high-end PC, but then again, it's also in an entirely different price bracket. Judged by enthusiast PC pricing, the Pro will be a steal, but as a console, it's not going to be cheap. Four years on from launch, the base PlayStation 5 is still expensive at $499/£479 and Sony has commented on the record about the extreme challenges in cost reducing the existing hardware. From this we can infer that PS5 Pro will be at least $100/£100 more expensive - and maybe more than that, depending on the configuration.Sony may aim to cut some costs by only having a digital model and clawing back money from detachable optical drive sales (I've already bought one, just in case - expect them to go out of stock rapidly if a digital-only machine is confirmed) but I'd still expect a disc-less Pro to cost significantly more than a disc-based standard model. Two SKUs? It's a possibility, but when the PS4 to PS4 Pro ratio was 80:20, we're dealing with a more niche product where multiple SKUs will be more difficult to justify.There's definitely a steep challenge in marketing PlayStation 5 Pro - but I wouldn't say it's an insurmountable one. Xbox One X and PS4 Pro proved that the market is there, that a premium model is viable and while there's no display-related impetus to prompt an upgrade this time, there are certainly enough areas to improve in today's games that will appeal to that more discerning audience in much the same way. My concern is more about the price point and the extent to which developers are inclined to use all of the new features. Many questions remain then, but at least from tomorrow, we should start to get some answers.","PlayStation's 30th anniversary celebrations kicked off last week - and in a somewhat unexpected way.

And what you've done by responding tothe 'memories of Eurogamer' piecein such abundance proves that yes, overwhelmingly, that happens, and I can't tell you how much that means to see. Thank you.I've been reading through the 300-something responses today and my heart has been well and truly warmed, as it has this entire Eurogamer 25 week. It's incredibly validating to see how valued Eurogamer is among you and how long some of you have been coming back here, through staff changes, through console eras, through changing internet landscapes. Through OnLive - remember that? Some of you do. It's no small feat reaching 25 years, and your comments highlight just how much has happened in them. You've also provided me, and us, with a strong reminder about what you want from the site and what you like about it, so thank you again.Eurogamer 25: The 25 Games That Made Eurogamer - HAPPY 25TH BIRTHDAY TO US!!!Watch on YouTubeI particularly like seeing comments about people discovering games on Eurogamer they hadn't heard of before, and they since went on to love, and it's nice to see people praise the honesty - the sometimes brutal honesty - of our reviews and the deeper stories we've told. We try, and it's nice to see that it lands sometimes. It's also nice to see people enjoy the goofier side of Eurogamer, like the puns and the long-running Oranges gag, or Martin's legendary live reports. Though if I had to single out any one repeatedly remarked upon favourite memory as far as laughter is concerned, it would have to be, simply, Ellie Gibson. Ellie joined us for the editors podcast I recorded for EG25 this week and it's a brilliant reminder of how funny she is.People recalled Tom Bramwell's searing editorials, they praised Christian Donlan's incredible writing, they repeatedly referred to Johnny and Aoife's friendly series of Let's Plays, and they cheered for the arrival of Digital Foundry on the site, many moons ago. There's love for the old-old podcast hosted by EGX legend Tom Champion, as there is love for the many EGX events he - and David and Matt and Rachel - organised. Quite a few of you remember Keza's original Demon's Souls import review; I do too - I remember how excited Keza was about this game no one else had heard of, and evidently she's got great taste. Some of you were even kind enough to recall the time I completely biffed up and reported that there would be Camaros inBattlefield 3. But it's also like many of you said: there are just just too many things to mention. Those names I highlighted are but a few you did, and there are many and more responsible for making Eurogamer what it is.A lot of you simply thanked the community spirit which is embodied inthe weekly What We've Been Playing series, and in how a seemingly innocuous article took on a life of its own. That has nothing to do with us by the way! You did that, with your emergent bold formatting and general encouragement. We just shepherd it along. Or perhaps we roll it along - that's a reference to Stephen's Sausage Roll and the meme-like back and forth we had with you, culminating in a special festive review of the game. And it's true by the way - youdomake this a nice place to be. You, collectively, are as much a part of Eurogamer as we are, and we never lose sight of that, even if we do jettison a forum from time to time.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThere are a few specific comments that stood out though. Joseph Cardle saying they got kicked out of their school library for laughing so hard atthe Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon reviewis exactly the kind of response I can imagine Ellie Gibson was after when she wrote it, and I smiled when RandolphScott recalled a scathing review for a game they worked on, not because they were angry about it, but because the specific part of the game they made was praised. Silver linings and all that! It's always nice to know the industry is watching.Knowing that Mr Bison's daughter has the middle name Zelda partially because they won tickets to a Zelda symphony concert through Eurogamer is a nice reminder of the unexpected effect seemingly small things can have. Similarly, hearing how McMurphy discovered Eurogamer while being severely struck down by Swine Flu was touching, too. ""Now, I'm not saying you saved my life,"" they said, ""that was the antibiotics, but I discovered everything about modern video games through EG and its community. After fifteen years, I’m still enjoying the puns, the comments, and the recommendations.""Hughroberts' entire twisting tale is worth reading and involves an Xbox 360 design-related event in London that they travelled from Liverpool down to - after reading an article on Eurogamer about it that same day - and where they saw behind-the-scenes prototypes and ate free canapes, before realising they hadn't entirely thought their plan through and were somewhat stranded. But it all worked out in the end, though the part about being seized by the police for breaking into Buckingham Palace is a heck of a cliff-hanger to end it on!We have randomly selected a winner to receive the Switch OLED, by the way, but it feels like a footnote in what the real value of the piece is. It's a reminder of all we've been through on Eurogamer over 25 years, and why we do the things we do.  Writers come and go and things change around us, but there's a uniqueness to what we have here that's worth remembering, as you - I'm very pleased to say - do.Have a lovely weekend and thanks for all the memories.","I think there's a hope we all have on the Eurogamer team that the things we do here, the articles we write or the videos we record, will mean something to the people who watch or read them.

And what you've done by responding to the 'memories of Eurogamer' piece in such abundance proves that yes, overwhelmingly, that happens, and I can't tell you how much that means to see. Thank you.

120,Celebrate the different design eras of Eurogamer with our theme switcher!,"When was the first time you visited Eurogamer? Do you remember what it looked like?In the 25 years that Eurogamer has existed, it has had at least six major design revisions. Thanks to archive.org's wonderfulWayback Machinewe can perform digital archeology and revisit those designs to see what was trendy in web design at the time - whether it be 11-point Verdana in the late 90s, rounded corners in the early aughts, or Proxima Nova becoming fashionable in the early twenty-teens.But... what if we could go one step further - and instead of looking at frozen examples from the past - enjoy any Eurogamer article using a working version of our older designs?To celebrateEurogamer's 25th anniversary, that's exactly what we've done!If you are using the desktop version of the site you'll notice at the top of the page a theme switcher, which allows you to experience Eurogamer articles as they looked at various points in history.Want to get a sense of how the site looked and felt in the very first days of the site? Switch to version one. Want to experience a lighter, more colourful (and the actual best) version of Eurogamer? Switch to version three!For those of you that dabble in web development and are curious about what's going on under the hood, here's a quick explanation. We've taken inspiration from the ""CSS Zen Garden"" and have produced different CSS themes that restyle the site. None of the HTML changes between versions - which was a limitation we had to get creative about when recreating some of the old layouts! - and we've used a few neat little tricks likeimg::contentto change the logos without touching any of the markup.We've tried to recreate all of the designs as closely as we can. They may not be pixel-perfect, but they give a sense of the style that was in use at the time. And seeing as the majority of these designs predate modern smartphones you will notice a lack of mobile support! (Anyone remember theWAPversion of Eurogamer?!)Huge thanks to Erin Young for leading the implementation, as well as the rest of our product and engineering team for testing, feedback, and support.As for how and when the different designs all came about, here is my rough Eurogamer design timeline.Version one - 1999-2000The first version of the site implemented dark mode before it was cool.At the time 800x600 monitors were common, and only core web fonts were available, so Verdana was the font of choice. Slate blues and yellows provide a nice contrasting palette. Note the italicised logo, and accompanying artwork from Unreal Tournament. A beautiful start.Version two - 2000-2003What's black, white, and red all over? Eurogamer's second design.It's not my favourite - I'm getting from it a slightly serious, newspaper-ish vibe, but the pixel-art icons on the right gives the site a certain charm. From memory this version had colour-coded headers depending on the content type or platform the article was about? I am glad the use of ""Trebuchet MS"" as a headline font was short-lived.Version three - 2003-2005The best looking version of Eurogamer. I love it.Look at that tasteful use of Arial with tight letter spacing for headers. The double colons in the breadcrumbs. The classy greys and oranges. The expertly designed pixel art. The chunky primary navigation. Absolutely gorgeous. Fondly referred to internally as the ""puddle of wee"" version due to the weird yellow shadow that sits below the globe in the logo.Version four - 2005-2011A very stable period in terms of design changes - this version was around for six years, which is a long time in internet years. This is the version of the site that a lot of the current Eurogamer team first worked on - myself included.In this era rounded corners were all the rage - but the border-radius CSS property wasn't widely supported, so lots of the little rounded corners were manually created using little spacer images which was fiddly to implement. This design uses my favourite variation of Eurogamer blue - hex code #0069F4. And note the sidebar promoting ""Eurogamers"" - our attempt at a social network for gamers.Version five - 2011-2018This design really had a lot going for it.Full of small details that are easy to miss like textured backgrounds, double-edged borders, and inset shadows. Critics might say maybe a little visually unstructured and noisy? The widest version of the site yet - 1280 pixels! - due to the average monitor size getting bigger.. It also introduced the use of Proxima Nova as our main font - a choice that was very on-trend in this era of web design.Version six - 2018-PresentModern day Eurogamer, and what you're looking at today. It debuted in 2018, and now six years old - and probably due for an update!This version is more visually austere and less textured than previous versions of the site. Designed to be a bit more serious and mature - I remember us discussing ideas like ""wot if The Guardian, but games"" when working on it. Built to make it easier to maintain the site across mobile and desktop versions, it uses Gibson as its typeface. In this version the Eurogamer blue was slightly darkened to help with colour contrast levels.It has been our absolute pleasure to revisit and recreate the old versions of Eurogamer - and I personally can't wait to see what other designs we'll be able to revisit in another 25 years time.Thanks to anyone and everyone that's been involved in Eurogamer's various design over the years. In no particular order: Mark Kennedy, Martin Taylor, Karl Cox, Lucy Grimwood, Jacob Jones, Sam Hayes, Erin Young, Chris Ward - and countless more.Give our theme switcher a go - and tell us in the comments which is your favourite design and why!",When was the first time you visited Eurogamer?

121,We're launching The Eurogamer 100 today - here's what it's all about,"Hello! You might have spotted Eurogamer is 25 this week, and so alongside the first appearance of a few permanent micro-wrinkles and a sharp decline in people asking us for ID, we're marking the occasion with something special.Actually, it's several things that are special,as editor-in-chief Tom Phillips explainedat the start of the week, but this one warrants a bit of explanation. Today marks the launch of the Eurogamer 100, a list of the very best video games to playright now.The emphasis, you might have spotted, is on that last bit. Somehow, in Eurogamer's 25 years of publication, we've never actually run a list of the best video games full stop. We've had lists by platform, by genre, by series, by month and most prominently of course, lists of the best games released each year - with avid contribution from you to our readers' top 50 alongside it, of course. But to our knowledge we've never had one, big all-timer.Well, technically we still haven't. Unlike most lists out there, the Eurogamer 100 isn't a list of the greatest games of all time, but of the best games to play in this specific moment. To make it onto the list, games must be (legally) obtainable and playable on current-generation hardware, which right now means consoles such as the Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, the various streaming and subscription services out there, mobiles, smart TVs, leftfield options like the Playdate, and of course the humble PC.That means no emulation, no dusting off old consoles, no games removed from storefronts everywhere. And it means they have to be in a good place, be that because they're still as brilliant to play now as they were when they first launched, or because they've been gradually improved over time to find themselves in great shape, or been faithfully updated, remade or restored.There's a reason for this: I think best-of lists are much better when they're useful. Video games, much to the sadness of some, aren't really much like other more static entertainment mediums like film, TV or music. They're more like restaurants, going in and out of business by changing with the times or failing to; moving the culture forward or following trends; seeing quality change as they lose star chefs or quietly heroic line cooks, kitchen porters or waiting staff. It's a bit of a long analogy, but it's worth it: video games are living, moving, and evolving by their very nature, and so a list of what to play should reflect that.Plus, aside from being helpful to our readers, it's also our job at Eurogamer to keep a proper eye on the medium at large, to champion lesser-known games that deserve your attention and might need a little help getting it, or to acknowledge the enormous skill and effort required to keep a live-service behemoth rolling along on top form. We value video games' history immensely - and find the waning availability of the classics as deeply troubling as you'd expect - but ultimately, there are enough lists out there looking backwards, and too few adapting to the way video games work today. Maybe we'll take a stab at an all-timer list some day in the future.To decide this, then, we did a bit of everything. We surveyed our current staff and most regular critics, talked to specialists about their genres, cross-referenced that with Eurogamer's historical writing on the games in question, and cross-referencedthatwith how those games are playing today. We'll then come back to the list and update it once per year, adding particularly brilliant new games that might have launched, old games that have found new life, and replacing those that may have found themselves in something of a dip.Naturally, the result will be a list you completely disagree with - all part of the fun! - but also, hopefully, one that feels genuinely useful, interesting, informative and, like the medium itself, a little bit alive.We'll be publishing the list over four days this week, 25 games at a time - 25th anniversary after all! - building to the full list and very top spot being revealed on Friday. For now,the first 25: read the Eurogamer 100 here.","Hello!

122,"DF Weekly: If Black Myth: Wukong has issues on PS5, is a Series S port viable?","Another gigantic DF Direct Weekly arrives today (well, on Saturday if you're signed up to theDF Supporter Program) and amongst topics as diverse as the latestPS5 Prorumours and Tom Morgan's impressions of MGS Delta and theSilent Hill 2remake, we have our own thoughts on theBlack Myth: WukongXbox drama. Why hasn't it appeared on Microsoft's consoles? Is there really some kind of PlayStation exclusivity deal? Is Series S the problem? Should we take developer statements about ongoing optimisation at face value? And what about the recent 'memory leak' story - can this really have put the Xbox version on indefinite hold (spoilers: no).News journalists with good track records have corroborated the Sony exclusivity angle (and to be clear, we've heard the same ourselves from sources with good knowledge of the situation) and the fact thatMicrosoft itself heavily hinted at such a deal being in placeadds extra weight - all PR statements have some degree of legal vetting before they're put out there. That said, audience reaction has quite rightfully pointed out that if there is a PlayStation deal in place, Sony is keeping awfully quiet about it. Well, the truth is that exclusivity deals can take many shapes and forms, and don't necessarilyneedto include marketing.Even so, there may well be the case that Game Science did/does require more time to get an Xbox version into shape.Back in June, a statement said, ""We are currently optimising the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologise for the delay and aim to minimise the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.""DF Direct Weekly #178: PS5 Pro Incoming? Black Myth: Wukong Xbox, MGS Delta/Silent Hill 2 Hands-On!May I present the 178th edition (not including Specials) of DF Direct Weekly #178, with John, Rich and Oliver at the mics, with a special guest appearance from Tom Morgan!Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:07News 1: PS5 Pro name, design possibly leaked0:27:16News 2: Why isn’t Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox?0:41:24News 3: Astro Bot VR ruled out - but PC could be coming0:49:53News 4: MGS Delta: Snake Eater preview!1:06:53News 5: Silent Hill 2 hands-on!1:26:24News 6: Avowed vows to target 30fps on Xbox Series consoles1:34:48Supporter Q1: What games do you most want to see updated for PS5 Pro?1:41:36Supporter Q2: How will Microsoft deal with the PS5 Pro?1:52:24Supporter Q3: Could Intel GPUs be in the next-gen consoles?1:56:35Supporter Q4: Given that the 4090 can no longer sustain native 4K at max settings in a lot of games, are we about to hit a performance wall?2:04:28Supporter Q5: Did Sony and Microsoft underestimate the needed console specs this generation?2:12:19Supporter Q6: Would DF consider adding a quantitative rating system to their reviews?There's definitely the sense that Game Science had some issues working on its first triple-A console title. For starters, the PlayStation 5 version has technical issues and also some poor decisions in terms of presentation. A 30fps quality mode runs with an unlocked frame-rate, adding needless judder. An intermediate 'balance' mode caps at 45fps, meaning there is no PS5-compatible display in the world that will give smooth, consistent performance. And finally, the 60fps performance mode uses FSR 3 frame generation to increase frame-rate at the expense of responsiveness and easily noticeable artefacts. The chances are an Xbox Series X version would have turned out much the same, while Xbox Series S would have been an altogether more challenging prospect.To get an idea of what Series Scoulddo, I broke out our Frankenstein's PC (which features an actual Series X CPU combined with a PS5-like RX 6700 GPU) and ran the Windows version of Black Myth: Wukong at matched settings. The result? Interestingly, the PC port runs around six percent slower when usually the RX 6700 runs five percent or so faster than the PS5. This gives us some idea of the differential between PS5 and equivalent PC performance. Then I swapped the RX 6700 for the RX 5500 XT. This GPU has the same memory bandwidth as the Series S, but two extra compute units. To get a matching 4TF, clocks need to reduce to 1420MHz.My take on the PS5 version is that Game Science really didn't want to cut back too much on its visual settings. It's essentially running at high settings across the board, albeit with texture quality that's surprisingly low - a low/medium hybrid. Take that mentality across to the RX 5500 XT and there are problems, even at 1080p resolution, upscaled from 720p. Black Myth: Wukong's visual effects and vegetation density can challenge the PS5 and on Series S-equivalent hardware, even a stable 30 frames per second is challenging to achieve.I eventually got some level of stability by retaining the same resolution but dropping quality settings down to medium, again targeting 30 frames per second. And if the PC version does run a little slower than console equivalents, an extra boost could take it over the line. Based on what I saw at medium settings, the game looks OK and obviously, it's still recognisably Black Myth: Wukong, but it's clearly compromised. The alternative to dropping settings would be to lower resolution - but looking at early UE5 titles likeImmortals of Aveum, I'm not sure that's a good idea for a game built on delivering intricate detail.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsHowever, while the RX 5500 XT gives us some idea of how a Series S-class GPU could run the game, that's just one part of the picture. Black Myth: Wukong is an Unreal Engine 5.0 title, bereft of the latest optimisations that Epic has added to an engine that's now in a 5.4 iteration. Developers have told us that in early UE5 development, memory management on Series S is challenging. Ultimately though, a range of early UE5 titles did ship on Xbox Series S, most of which turned out just fine - albeit running at low internal resolutions.Ultimately then, there's every chance that there's more than one reason why Black Myth: Wukong didn't launch on Xbox consoles at the same time as PlayStation 5 - and bearing in mind that the PS5 code has issues, a delayed Xbox version may reap the benefits of the extra time. But the memory leak story? This emerged duringGamescom, suggesting that the Xbox version was indefinitely delayed because of a… memory leak? It's hard to believe that a problem like this wouldindefinitelydelay a game, especially when both Sony and Microsoft have technical staff on hand to assist developers.This is just one story in a new episode of DF Direct Weekly that's almost 140 minutes long! We discuss the latest PS5 Pro rumours and leaks, Tom shares his thoughts on MGS Delta and the Silent Hill 2 remake, while - guess what - we're absolutely fine with Avowed on consoles running at 30fps. On the latter point, the deeper we move into the generation, the more developers are going to want to push the consoles and there are clear limitations in doing so. Regardless, I hope you enjoy the Direct!","Another gigantic DF Direct Weekly arrives today (well, on Saturday if you're signed up to the DF Supporter Program ) and amongst topics as diverse as the latest PS5 Pro rumours and Tom Morgan's impressions of MGS Delta and the Silent Hill 2 remake, we have our own thoughts on the Black Myth: Wukong Xbox drama.

124,Eurogamer turns 25,"25 years ago this week, two brothers from Brighton helped set up a website about video games. They based the fledgling operation in their parents' converted garage and named it Eurogamer - a spin-off of a Quake 2 tournament they used to run, EuroQuake.By the time I joined, in 2010, Eurogamer was a household name in the global games industry, and that small garage-based gang had grown into a team soon to fill a three-storey office in the centre of the city.Eurogamer had carved out a reputation for writing fearlessly about video games, and earned itself a brilliantly engaged, knowledgeable and loyal audience as a result.It had also retained some of that feeling of still being a family operation - of being a place where its staff members and audience understood each other and shared the same passions, enjoyed the same in-jokes and jointly anticipated the publication of the next big review score.14 years on, I still feel that to be the case. And now, I have the privilege of serving as editor-in-chief as we collectively celebrate the next big milestone: Eurogamer's 25th anniversary.This week, we'll be reflecting on the past quarter century with a few faces that will be familiar if you've been following Eurogamer for some time. We'll also be looking forward at what's coming next for video games (and goodness, 2025 is going to be exciting) to where we all might be inanother25 years.And as for the present... well, we're also set to launch a major new project, The Eurogamer 100, an annually-updated list of our top picks for what you can play right now. We hope it'll be useful all year round.For fun, we'll be unlocking the ability to read Eurogamer as it looked at various points in our history, thanks to a handy theme switcher (yes, Eurogamer originally looked even more retro than it does now).

125,DF Weekly: Indiana Jones is heading to PS5 - and everything is changing for Xbox,"Gamescom 2024's Opening Night Live was a lacklustre event - but one announcement changed everythiong. As the event moved into its final few minutes, new footage of the extremely promisingIndiana Jones and the Great Circlewas shown, with an announcement that the game arrives in December, followed by a PlayStation 5 launch in Spring 2025. It signals a clear intent from Microsoft for Xbox to embrace a multi-platform future - and the response was mixed, to say the least. Change is always accompanied by uncertainty, but the Xbox strategy is coming into focus now and I think the choices are sound. However, questions surround the role of the Xbox itself - as a console - as the firm moves ever closer to full multi-platform publishing.This change is driven by necessity and the reality of games development and publishing. On a general level, all of the major platform holders are grappling with the stark reality that the overall console audience has plateaued and in terms of the number of actual players, not much has changed since the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation. Meanwhile, the cost of making games has ballooned massively, with triple-A titles often requiring blockbuster movie-level budgets. From the cost of the Xbox Live subscription, through season passes, micro-transactions and Game Pass/PlayStation Plus, the industry has been able to increase revenues from those same players - but the cost of doing business continues to rise regardless.This is one reason why Microsoft expanded the Xbox platform to encompass PC (a logical progression bearing in mind its Windows stewardship), while Sony has blurred the lines with first-party exclusivity with PlayStation titles, where - again - PC is seen as a lucrative growth prospect. Both firms are also invested to varying degrees with cloud gaming. Microsoft is taking things further though: the Indiana Jones PS5 announcement signals that Xbox games now operate on a timed window of exclusivity. Messaging fromPhil Spencersuggests that more games will arrive on more platforms and I wouldn't be surprised if that's all of them in due course.DF Direct Weekly #177: Indiana Jones on PS5, STALKER 2 Xbox Hands-On, FF16 PC Demo, Black State!The big Indiana Jones PS5 announcement is just one topic in another packed edition of DF Direct Weekly.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:58News 01: Indiana Jones headed to PS50:19:53News 02: Hands-on with STALKER 20:31:31News 03: FF16 demo tested on PC!0:47:13News 04: Black State impresses0:57:50News 05: Gamescom Opening Night Live highlights1:06:45News 06: Nvidia's Gamescom announcements1:19:14Supporter Q1: Is disabling RT depending on the scene a good idea?1:27:47Supporter Q2: Is Series S preventing a Black Myth: Wukong release on Xbox?1:34:33Supporter Q3: Why did Wukong on PS5 use FSR and not TSR?1:38:35Supporter Q4: Could improved Wukong performance be a good selling point for PS5 Pro?1:45:06Supporter Q5: How will Microsoft differentiate the next Xbox?1:52:21Supporter Q6: Did Microsoft and Sony focus on the wrong features with PS5 and Xbox Series?2:01:18Supporter Q7: Is 12GB enough VRAM for graphics cards this generation?It all makes sense. Microsoft's acquisition strategy has effectively made it a de facto multi-platform publisher - possibly the biggest in the world. A game like Minecraft could never become an Xbox-exclusive. The sheer scale ofActivision BlizzardKing, not to mention the budgets behind Call of Duty, makes Xbox exclusivity for those games a non-starter. Bethesda? The question is the extent to whichStarfield's Xbox exclusivity enhanced the Xbox brand or diminished the return on what would have been a huge investment. Either way, from my perspective at least, taking a multi-platform publisher like Bethesda and enforcing exclusivity doesn't quite feel right. Maybe Xbox management feels the same, as Phil Spencer often talks about getting games played by as many people as possible, no matter what systems they own.The general direction of travel in the business, combined with the increased return on investment from multi-platform publishing just makes good business sense - but where does this leave the Xbox console owner? There's an argument now that states that PlayStation owners will get all the games, while Xbox owners won't. A procession of bad headlines has painted a picture of decline around the Xbox business - even though Microsoft's figures suggest only a very small downturn, and even then, only if you factor out Activision Blizzard King revenues. Add them in and it's in rude health.Meanwhile, Phil Spencer is careful to stress that overall console users in the ecosystem have never been higher, which suggests two things. Firstly, Xbox owners who have extensive digital libraries are staying with Xbox, and the same will be true in higher numbers on PlayStation, of course. Secondly, there are still a hell of a lot of Xbox One players out there - and we know this is also true on PlayStation with the recent revelation that 50 percent of PlayStation users are still on PS4. Will Indiana Jones and other Xbox games arriving on PlayStation change the status quo? Perhaps for a die-hard minority, but the impact to the overall ecosystem will likely be more limited.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThere is a hardware challenge, however. Sony will have a PlayStation 5 Pro soon and Microsoft has no plans for an enhanced Xbox Series console. But what we are getting - remarkably - is messaging from Xbox on new hardware, even though leaked documents revealed a roadmap leading up to a 2028 next-gen release. The 2028 plans are out-of-date, it's said, and in time, the 'real plan' will emerge. Phil Spencer has repeatedly talked about handhelds and he's mentioned the idea of competing stores on Xbox hardware - all of which suggests that PC and Windows have a big part to play in the console space.We've discussed this a lot on DF Direct, but if that is the plan, it has merit - Valve's Steam Deck is the perfect example of a fully viable console built on an existing, non-console operating system and we're already starting to see the arrival of Windows enhancements that make Xbox gaming more viable on PC handhelds.In the short term though, there is the thorny issue that Sony consoles - principally, PS5 Pro - will be hosting Xbox games that run better on PlayStation than they do on Microsoft hardware. With that in mind, the sooner there is clarity on next-gen hardware, the better. Remember, Xbox president Sarah Bond has mooted the ""biggest technological leap ever seen in a generation"" - another jigsaw piece we need to slot into the Xbox hardware strategy puzzle. Microsoft has laid out its ambitions which would have been challenging enough to achieve by 2028 but the fact that the firm is talking about hardware at all right now does suggest the schedule has changed.But change is good - and from my perspective as a journalist, the events of the last week are actually very exciting. Microsoft is looking to disrupt the status quo and the Xbox team is clearly not afraid to make controversial decisions that amount to a complete rethink of console strategy. Nothing is off the table and while risky, it must be liberating for Microsoft too. We know where the software side of the business is heading and while there may be title-by-title tweaks, we now have a precedent on how multi-platform blockbusters will be handled. Xbox as a platform is evolving - and as Phil Spencer says, we should expect more change. But if the platform is evolving, where does that leave the hardware? I'm looking forward to finding out.","Gamescom 2024 's Opening Night Live was a lacklustre event - but one announcement changed everythiong.

There are also a host of ""AI"" features for overclocking, cooling and networking, the vast majority of which don't seem to use artifical intelligence in the traditional sense of the word, so we'll skip them for now.Thankfully, the non-AI features are pretty exciting. I'm particularly looking forward to trying the new UEFI shipping on these motherboards, which can show a live readout of all connected components on a diagram - with details made clearer by a higher resolution interface. You can jump immediately from this diagram to relevant settings for a connected device that you select; eg to the fan settings when looking at a connected fan header.This one is special: New UEFI BIOS functionality for the latest ASUS AM5 X870 motherboards, including a new UEFI BIOS Q-DashboardI have been with ASUS for over 15 years and have been lucky to work with our team since we first implemented UEFI as part of our firmware/BIOS.

Asus claims that this can allow for 400MT/s higher RAM speeds than their traditional designs, which could be nice for anyone going beyond the usual 6000MT/s sweet spot. All X870E/X870 motherboards include JEDEC support up to DDR5-5600 and real-time memory overclocking in Ryzen Master, so RAM tinkering could be quite fruitful.Finally, some motherboards have ""Q-Release Slim"" PCIe 5.0 slots, which allow graphics cards to be locked into place during normal use but easily removed with a specific movement, without needing to manually unlatch the slot or even press a button as we saw on Asus' original Q-Release PCIe slots. This is the first thing I'll test on the new motherboards, which ship in September.Zotac Zone PC handheld - can it rival the Asus ROG Ally X?Image credit:ZotacZotac is getting into the popular PC handheld game, joining the likes of Asus, Lenovo and MSI. Their Windows 11 handheld is called the Zone, and it comes with a Ryzen 8840U chipset, 1080p 120Hz OLED (!) display and a $799 price tag. That puts it directly against the (excellent) Asus ROG Ally X, and it's unfortunately hard to see why buyers would prefer the Zotac model.In terms of specs, the Zone compares disfavourably to the ROG Ally X with a significantly smaller battery (49Wh vs 80Wh) and less RAM (16GB vs 24GB), with largely identical hardware elsewhere. That OLED screen is the one saving grace, and did prove exceptional on theSteam Deck OLED, but the Zone might still need to be a bit cheaper than the revised Asus handheld to stand a chance.The software side of things is also dicey. Asus' Armory Crate software isn't a patch on SteamOS, but it's probably the most robust software solution we've seen on a Windows handheld, with even handheld veterans like Ayaneo struggling to match it. Zotac's software experience will benefit fromimprovements to the Game Barthat upgrade all Windows 11 handhelds, but it's unlikely to be as polished - and SteamOS may be a bit more challenging to get working on the Zotac device given thatValve is looking at the Ally specificallywhen it comes to porting over their operating system.Still, early impressions of the Zotac Zone were largely positive, especially in terms of the quality of its controls, so we'll have to wait and see how the finished article performs when it arrives - likely in September.Asus reveals the first dual-mode LCD monitor, swapping from 4K 160Hz to 1080p 320HzImage credit:Asus/Digital FoundryBack in the day, CRT monitors were pretty amendable to tweaking and changing. You could push them to hit way higher refresh rates by dialling back the resolution - and even this year we've seen enthusiasts hit700Hz on old CRTsthis way. LG was the first to apply this technique to new monitors, releasing a 32-inch OLED panel that couldswap between 4K 240Hz and 1080p 480Hz modesin a matter of seconds. Now, Asus is introducing a 27-inchROG Strix XG27UCGLCD monitor with similar ""dual-mode"" functionality, allowing for a choice between 4K 160Hz and 1080p 320Hz.That's a nice combination for those that like the higher resolution for work or single-player gaming but still want a highly competitive screen for esports titles, and it should be cheaper than the 32-inch LG too. Expect this monitor towards the end of the year, with prices to come later.WD announces 8TB SN850P PS5 SSD - but you should get the way cheaper SN850X insteadImage credit:WDThe WD SN850P is one of thebest SSD upgrades for PS5, and WD has announced a massive 8TB model which costs $999/£719. Unfortunately, that's a huge premium over the identically-specced WD SN850X, which is available for£654 with a heatsink or £600 withoutat WD's official site. I'd highly recommend sticking with the SN850X, as its heatsink version is equally PS5 compatible, and of course both models can work inside a PC too. The only thing you're giving up is one month of PS Plus Premium membership, which is worth £13.49 - hardly worth it!Black Myth: Wukong and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 Edition graphics cards revealed - though you (probably) can't buy themImage credit:Asus via VideocardzImage credit:iGameTheexcellent-lookingWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 andtechnically-accomplishedBlack Myth: Wukong have both inspired special edition graphics cards at Gamescom, with Asus producing a special edition RX 7900 XTX for the former and a huge amount of Nvidia partners producing RTX 4070 to RTX 4080 Super designs for the latter. The Asus Warhammer design is beautiful, but only 20 have been made so you'll have towin a giveawayto get one.The Wukong graphics cards look like they're entering slightly fuller production, with listings on JD.com for the Chinese market. The most powerful options are the Colorful RTX 4080 Super iGame Advanced and Galax RTX 4070 Ti Super 20th Anniversary, but there are also six different RTX 4070 Super special edition models from MSI, Gigabyte, Zotac, Inno3D, Gainward and Manli. The cheapest Wukong special edition GPU goes for 4949 RMB (~£530) and the most expensive is 9199 RMB (~£990).Nvidia switches the RTX 4070 to slower GDDR6 and ditches the G-Sync module to cut costsFinally, here's a bit of a weird one: Nvidia has confirmed that its partners are now making RTX 4070 graphics cards with GDDR6 memory, rather than the faster GDDR6X that comes on the standard RTX 4070 and all higher-tier Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics cards. The move is described as a measure ""to improve supply and availability to meet strong demand"" and presumably allows for both a lower bill of materials cost and access to more readily available GDDR6 modules.I'm not a fan of these sorts of news, as most buyers won't be aware of the change and would reasonably expect the same performance as the GDDR6X version. Nvidia is claiming the new variant offers ""similar performance"", and with around a five percent drop in memory bandwidth from 21Gbps to 20Gbps, wewouldexpect performance would be well within this margin in most workloads. Still, these cards ought to come clearly labelled and with a commensurate discount - we'll have to see if that's the case.Nvidia also announced that its G-Sync tech has beentransplanted into MediaTek scalers, replacing the separate Altera FPGAs that made full-fat G-Sync monitors around $100 more expensive than their FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible counterparts. The new MediaTek scalers debut in the AOC Agon Pro AG276QSG2, Acer Predator XB273U F5 and ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQNR, all of which are 1440p 360Hz models expected by the end of the year. All three will support G-Sync Pulsar, which combines variable frequency BFI and VRR, so it'll be fascinating to see that technology in the flesh - especially if these models cost less than standard G-Sync monitors.That just about does it for now, but there's plenty more I wish I had time to write about. Some interesting stories that didn't make the cut include Crkd'stiny yet functional gamepads, higher-spec and nicely designedPhilips Evnia 8000-series monitorsand HP Omen peripherals including the beautiful-lookingHyperX Alloy Rise 75, a 15,000 hour wireless gaming keyboard.Thankfully, the good folks at the Eurogamer news deskhavewritten up a non-PC hardware reveal: thedigital, white-chassis Series X is up for pre-order.I'm sure there'll be more from Gamescom before the show closes, so stay tuned - and if you're at the event, you can pick up a Digital Foundry or Eurogamer shirt from the IGN merch store on the show floor.","Gamescom 2024 is officially underway in Cologne - and alongside a raft of game announcements at Opening Night Live , a lot of new PC hardware has also been shown off for the first time.

Please keep us company.Please.What do we expect to see today? Well, probably Geoff Keighley, but also the new Indiana Jones game,Monster Hunter Wilds, and Dune Awakening. We're also expectingLittle Nightmarescreator Tarsier to unveil its new project, which could be exciting. On top of that:Diablo 4expansion Vessel of Hatred, Civilization 7, hero shooter Marvel Rivals, Lost Records (the project made by the creators of Life is Strange),Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (which was recently delayed), and Black Ops 6. Keighley's best palHideo Kojima has also been tweeting enigmatic silhouetted picturesof actors who are presumably playing roles in Death Stranding 2.And before you ask, ""Yes, there will be new game announcements,""Keighley said on X.The show is expected to run for two hours.

I shall swiftly amend -swoosh!–Robert Purchese13:15 pmUTCEarl-Grey says:Just like how the near-mythical beast Michael Bublé's traditional emergence from his cave signals the imminent arrival of The Festive Season, Keighley's appearance signals that Summer will give way to Autumn and the Season of Hot Chocolate and Comforting Spices will soon be upon us.Haha I love this.–Robert Purchese13:23 pmUTCI found the best area of Gamescompic.twitter.com/nhCz0fuYWA— Ian Higton (@IanHigton)August 20, 2024To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsMeanwhile, from the Gamescom show floor...–Robert Purchese17:37 pmUTCWhat ho! Good evening - is it evening yet? What have I missed? Wait, I'm supposed to tell you that aren't I. Well I'm here now. I've had a bit of bread and cheese and some chocolate, and I'm in.–Robert Purchese17:38 pmUTCAh, that was Sniper Elite: Resistance that we just saw - a resistance-themed take on World War 2, I think it was. I like a resistance-themed game - it reminds me of school.–Robert Purchese17:42 pmUTCKami says:Evening Bertie! Hope you're having a lovely evening so far :)Oh thank you! And to you too.I am now we're seeing Enotria and a GIANT CRAB. I thought those were extinct.–Robert Purchese17:43 pmUTCLet's see what you've all been talking about...–Robert Purchese17:45 pmUTCChrisTapsellEG says:speaking of giant crabs I went to the Crab Museum in Margate recently and it was brilliant. They had a giant crab section with a lengthy story about the Giant Margate Crab, and also several disclaimers around the room saying not everything in the museum is true, as a kind of post-modern lesson on learning how truth works. It was good.I have to work with him!–Robert Purchese17:47 pmUTCI quite like Kyle Bosman and this whole intro bit. Nice cat: check - I assume it's not a robot. Nice luminous Twitch streaming name on the wall behind. Depressing bookshelf: check.Bosman's doing a good job of filling the slot without sounding like he's been paid to fill the slot. He's funny without trying too hard, and it's not loud and overbearing. I think that's a win.–Robert Purchese17:48 pmUTC""A first-person farming horror allegory"" did that say?–Robert Purchese17:49 pmUTCWhat in the absolute world are we watching? A young person, masculine sounding, has found themselves in control of a farm. It's first-person, as expected, and you do menial chores, but you also have - oh my god! - monsters jumping out at you.We Harvest the Shadows, it's called, and it's a solo-dev game made by David Wehle. And there's a demo on Steam now. I'll play that tomorrow.–Robert Purchese17:50 pmUTCIt's an ""anti-cosy game"". I love that. I love made-up terms.–Robert Purchese17:51 pmUTCAh, maybe there's a tinge of mental illnes going on in the game, so perhaps some of these monsters are imagined.This character apparently wants to be alone all the time but is being watched. Intriguing!–Robert Purchese17:53 pmUTCOn to a super-scary trailer with Biblical undertones now. Fireshrine Games.It opens with some skulls, static on a TV, an abandoned police car, lights still flashing. A person's hand staked to a headboard. A mansion. Barbed wire, a gun. Dark corridors. A knight? Monsters. Broken jaws. A.I.L.A.Ah! This person had a VR headset on. Or did they?Coming 2025.–Robert Purchese17:54 pmUTCNow we've zoomed onto to a kind of comedy colony management game in space. Ah! Revenge of the Savage Planet - a sequel. There's a full gameplay reveal tomorrow in the Xbox stream.–Robert Purchese17:56 pmUTCNow we're onto a life sim that's a lot like The Sims but in much higher fidelity it looks like, and more zoomed in. This looks really impressive. People are throwing food at each other, arguing, watering their garden, chopping food, putting out pan fires, driving, playing music, sitting on the beach. It's called Inzoi. There's a character creator going up on Steam... now, I think.–Robert Purchese17:58 pmUTCAnother game announcement now and we're not even into the main show. I'd quite happily watch this for another couple of hours to be honest. It's much calmer.This seems like some kind of sci-fi horror game. We're seeing space suits and some stressed out character running from something, and exploring a space station. Oh, they've seen themselves!We're seeing a montage of the game now - Directive 8020 - and people's faces are bulging out all hideously. It's coming 2025.–Robert Purchese18:00 pmUTCA look at Terry in Street Fighter 6 now. He looks very Terry-ish. There, eat your heart out Wes - I know my fighting games!.–Robert Purchese18:01 pmUTCThe show beginsAnd the show begins! Geoff Keighley walks onto the stage, desparately hoping for the celebrity status he graves. Although, well, he kind of is a celebrity now isn't he?""Guten abend, Gamescom!"" he shouts, all smiles.–Robert Purchese18:02 pmUTCThis is the first time there's a live, signed version of the show by the way. I didn't embed the signed stream but you can find it easily on YouTube if you need it.Apparently we're going to see some game announcements we're not expecting. Big words, Geoff, big words.I wonder if he talks like this when he goes to the shop, announcing his way around the aisles.–Robert Purchese18:04 pmUTCBorderlands 4 announced for 2025A world premiere now that hasn't leaked. 2K Games. Gearbox. Spooky music.We're seeing a planet with purple lines cracked into it. It's not a stealth showing of the terrible Borderlands film is it?The planet has crashed down through some icy barrier. Flaming missiles of some kind are hitting the planet. There's a fiery crater - is it Gandalf? No, it's a robot of some kind picking up a mask. It is Borderlands.Borderlands 4. 2025.–Robert Purchese18:05 pmUTCKami says:and Call of Duty, so scheduled loo break has already arrived! XDHaha, quite.–Robert Purchese18:06 pmUTCCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 segment now to talk about the game's campaign as the Cold War comes to an end.We're about to see gameplay showing a rogue team that's targeted a senator at a fundraiser. You're in that team. This mission is Most Wanted.–Robert Purchese18:10 pmUTCThere's a nice spy vibe going on here. You have to take photos, you have to find objects hidden in clocks. There's a bit of choking people out too, obviously, and some shooting, but it's not a fire fight. It's more like Hitman or James Bond, and damn that camera is fancy - it's got a lot of functions.It looks, as you can imagine, great.Oh dear, things have gone to shit now and we've reverted to gun-toting Call of Duty gameplay. It is a COD game after all.There's a VHS fast-forward and rewind effect going on, as if someone is watching the footage somewhere and then you're playing it to experience it. Maybe it's just an effect done for this trailer. It's quite nifty. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for VHS.–Robert Purchese18:10 pmUTCGavvie says:I'm excited for 4derlands.Hah - very good!–Robert Purchese18:11 pmUTCKami says:Quality a bit high for VHS. Maybe Betamax? XDBRB paging Digital Foundry for the official verdict!–Robert Purchese18:13 pmUTCOoh, now we're on a motorbike inside the building. Now we've wheelied out of the fundraiser and we're in a car chase, which is a really irresponsible thing to be in, frankly. Helpfully, our enemies have the back doors to their trucks open so we can shoot them. And then it's over! That's the end of COD! Until the game comes out of course. End of August, early Sept for the open betas.–Robert Purchese18:15 pmUTCBack to Geoff, who's announcing his co-host Sjokz - Eefje Depoortere. There's a feminine presence on stage!–Robert Purchese18:16 pmUTCWe're seeing a strange trailer that's a kind of mash-up of video game memes. It's staged in a prison and we are a warden of sorts walking through it.There's a goat.It's...No.–Robert Purchese18:17 pmUTCMalek86 says:Goat Simulator.... I think?Ding ding ding!Goat Simulator Remastered, specifically.–Robert Purchese18:21 pmUTCDying Light: The Beast announcedAnother new game announcement coming.We're in a forest with modern day soldiers walking through it. It's Techland, the Dying Light studio.There's some kind of beast in the trees looking down on them. It's breathing heavily - maybe it's got a cold?The soldiers are swearing in British accents. ""Bloody hell,"" they say. There are a few corpses.The beast rushes them. Screams. Blind gunfire.Now we're seeing a montage of the soldiers being hunted. Now a sunrise.""Every man has an animal within. If you push too much, you might release the beast.""Dying Light: The Beast. No date.Geoff adds that it's got 20 hours of gameplay. It seems like it's an expandalone - a standalone expansion.–Robert Purchese18:23 pmUTCA Black Myth: Wukong moment here - a debut of the launch trailer. It's very pretty, as you well know by now.An Xbox date perhaps? Nope.–Robert Purchese18:25 pmUTCA brief King of Meat animated section there, before we hop to a world premiere trailer. Trap places, play with up to three friends. Cypress Hill bopping in the background. This is a wild-looking hack and slash party game.–Robert Purchese18:29 pmUTCGeoff's going to introduce us to a brand new game and team. The game is Lynked: Banner of the Sparked - it's got bright Overwatch art vibes. The studio is FuzzyBot.It's a co-op action hack and slash. Brawl, build and befriend robots. You're one of the last remaining humans and you have to fight a robot army.The first trailer now. It's Skylanders bright. It's got a sheen of casual and free-to-play about it. You build your own town in the game.–Robert Purchese18:30 pmUTCKami says:Wow it went quiet, not flagging already are we?This segment has gone on a wee bit long.Early access coming 22nd October this year.–Robert Purchese18:32 pmUTCA first look at gameplay from Lost Records now - the game made by the creators of Life is Strange.A roadside diner. A garage where a teenage band is rehearsing. Handycame footage. It's got a lovely sundrenched look, as you probably expect. The friends have gone Stand By Me hiking in the woods. They're coming up with a band name.Oh now something strange is happening. Back to the roadside. Your friend is telling you their mum found a package on their doorstep. That's it, I think.–Robert Purchese18:34 pmUTCPivot to zombies. Baseball bats to the face. Dark roats, shambling hordes, crazed tannoy announcements. No More Room in Hell 2, whatever that is. It's 8-player co-op from Torn Banner, the Chivalry developer! But that's all we're seeing.–Robert Purchese18:34 pmUTCZombie-Hamster says:There was a No More Room In Hell 1?!Haha, touché! (But also: I concur.)–Robert Purchese18:35 pmUTCSuper-brief look at action survival game Arc Raiders there, which is coming next year. It's one of those stylish but stingy trailers that sets a tone but doesn't really show anything. Getting strong The Last of Us vibes from it though.–Robert Purchese18:39 pmUTCThe deliriously bright and colourful Infinity Nikki swoops by, somewhat literally. Now we're seeing a launch trialer for Space Marine 2.Now it's Omeda Studios and some kind of multiplayer team-based shooter. I feel like I've played this. It's called Predecessor and it's already available. A third-person, over the shoulder MOBA.Ah it was made from the ashes of Epic's Paragon! That's where I remember it from.–Robert Purchese18:39 pmUTCThe deliriously bright and colourful Infinity Nikki swoops by, somewhat literally.

We're getting a first look at gameplay and a release date, it sounds like. Or maybe it's a beta date.We're seeing character customisation. Now we're onto the orangey sand and we're alone out there, hunted by sand worms. I guess they're used to this kind of desert gameplay after Conan Exiles.Oh here's another player on some kind of quad bike. They've got a fancy suit on and a gun that they're giving us. You can climb up sheer walls and then shipe down from above.There are swordmasters who are upfront fighters, there are assault troopers who fight at mid-range. There are jetpacks. Then you loot enemies. Nothing is wasted here.You can build huge and impressive looking bases. It's a bit more high tech than I was expecting. There's a blueprint system that lets you create designs and then sell them to other players - so it sounds quite modular.You can make an ornithopter. There's an in-game radio that will clue you into events happening around the desert.–Robert Purchese18:47 pmUTCThere are settlements here where we can pledge allegiance to the great houses of Dune. We're in the dark shady buildings you remember from the film, providing you've seen it. It looks impressive this - there's the suggestion of lots of other players and their war machinery coming together in big battles.No sign of worm-surfing.Coming to PC early in 2025. Console release dates TBA.–Robert Purchese18:48 pmUTCLittle Nightmares dev Tarsier reveals ReanimalOoh ooh Tarsier's new game now - the creator of Little Nightmares.It's a dark world a lot like Little Nightmares. In fact - it looks a lot, lot like Little Nightmares - the same characters and perspective and general vibe.Reanimal it's called, and PC, PS5 and Xbox are all mentioned.Was it just me or did that look exactly like Little Nightmares?–Robert Purchese18:50 pmUTCI mean, it looking like Little Nightmares is a good thing. Tarsier do great work and its LN games were great - I don't know how good LN3 will be. But I don't see an obvious difference in this new one.–Robert Purchese18:51 pmUTCGenshin Impact Xbox release dateA short one: Genshin Impact is finally coming to Xbox on 20th November.–Robert Purchese18:55 pmUTCMonster Hunter Wilds time now. A new trailer. Some deliriously wild screams from the audience there.Ooh we're in the nest of some kind of gigantic spidery cotton plant. It just grabbed a huge bear! Wilds certainly looks wild.Now we're in camp. Now we're on mounts. It's a very montagey look at the game it seems. There's lovely character and equipment detail, as you'd expect. The monsters look great too. We're seeing a kind of metallic dragon that can channel lighting and roll up into a metal ball.A selection of smaller enemies now and that brings us to the end of the trailer.No it doesn't! A quick shot at some oversized meat in the game.It's coming 2025.–Robert Purchese18:57 pmUTCKami says:Wait, Mai what are you wearing? Where's the red dress?!Some real-time panic in the audience there. I wish the costume and character design wasn't quite so ridiculous though.–Robert Purchese18:59 pmUTCMonument Valley 3 coming to Netflix on 10th DecA multiplayer mech game called Mechabreak whisked past there. Now: Monument Valley.Monument Valley 3 specifically. A trailer. There was an open vield section there. More mind-bending perception puzzles to solve but also some plesant-looking sailing now. It looks great, albeit like more of the same.It's coming exclusively to Netflix Games on 10th December.–Robert Purchese19:00 pmUTCZombie-Hamster says:Only on Netflix...Yeah.

Psst, Chris went to see this recently at Firaxis, and will share his thoughts soon.–Robert Purchese19:02 pmUTCWe're getting our first look at Civ 7 now.Ooh a hurricane! Gorgeous detail on settlements, but the nice chunky player pieces still remain. It's obviously hard to get a sense from a sizzle reel like this what's new and how the game plays of course. But it looks nice.There's a proper gameplay showcase coming after Opening Night Live.–Robert Purchese19:04 pmUTCA segment for Starfield: Shattered Space there. It's coming 30th September. We got to see a new space buggy. We'll be seeing this at Gamescom by the way, so expect our thoughts soon.–Robert Purchese19:06 pmUTCMarvel Rivals launches 6th DecemberI was watching DF's Tom Morgan play Marvel Rivals the other day, and it gives me massive Overwatch vibes, which is a good thing. Melee Overwatch. I'm keen to give it a go.It's coming 6th December.–Robert Purchese19:08 pmUTCApparently Gamescom runs entirely on renewable energy, which is cool.

Probably not but whew...Running Up the Building 2!–Robert Purchese19:12 pmUTCBack to Geoff. Here's Deadpool director Tim Miller. Okay...He's talking about Blur Studios which has been making cinematics for games for years. ""We do this because we fucking love video games,"" he says, and everyone cheers.Fans ask for full movies, and, well, it sounds like they listened. A collaboration with Amazon Studios and game publishers. He's getting choked up on stage - I love it! ""I cry a lot."" The audience cheers.They've been working on this for three years. It's called Secret Level. He pauses again for emotion. The audience cheers. He tries to compose himself. ""It is our love letter to games,"" he says, voice cracking. It's coming out 10th December.That was very endearing!–Robert Purchese19:15 pmUTCLove Death and Robots people making animated anthology based on gamesFrom the people behind Love Death and Robots, a new anthology series themed around video games, it seems like.

It's coming to Steam Next Fest later this year too.–Robert Purchese19:19 pmUTCKingdom Come Deliverance 2 now. I'm looking forward to this.It seems to have a much livelier tone now. We're once again Henry, riding around Bohemia on our horse. The sword fighting looks similar but a bit less slapstick - there's more linked animation to it now, with things like killing blows.Short trailer, but it's on show this week. It's coming out in February.–Robert Purchese19:20 pmUTCBillhickswasright says:Poland is sweltering at night atm 😭 my Irish skin after 5 years canny take it..

Um - forest?Hold that thought - it's another world premier!–Robert Purchese19:28 pmUTCIt's Little Nightmares 3, being developed by Supermassive - the Until Dawn bunch. Weird seeing this and Tarsier's new game in the same conference. I think Tarsier's looked weirder and more intriguing.This looks fine.I'm reminded ofan interview I did with Tarsier ahead of Little Nightmares 2, where we talked about the nature of fear. It was a good chat.–Robert Purchese19:30 pmUTCHerdling there, a furry herding game - furry not in that sense. Seemed very cool!

Oh god he's not going to promise an acorn growing into a tree is he again. He's talking about Dungeon Keeper and Black and White and taking things from those games - and from Fable.Tom Phillips went to go and see Molyneux recently to write about this, by the way, so expect to see much more on this and in much more detail momentarily.I've got a soft spot for Molyneux.–Robert Purchese19:34 pmUTCWe're flying over a chonky fantasy world. We're at a kind of god's eye view as if it is acity building game. Build it by day, defend it from monster by night.We can zoom right into the town and into shops to make pies and sandwiches. There's a hand cursor a bit like Dungeon Keeper.We can design and customise all of the buildings and it looks tactile and easy to do. It's a small walled town.We can possess characters, again as in Dungeon Keeper, and we can fight the creatures that are attacking. Back in god mode, we can unleash spells.It's pleasant looking but it definitely has a lower budget look to it. It's a sandbox game. And that's it. No date.19:35 pmUTCperfect_organism says:Nice of the Thing to stop by for this trailer.Haha - this made me laugh!–Robert Purchese19:37 pmUTCThere's a Squid Game game coming to Netflix.Ooh now we're onto something Bandai Namco and that's the Yennefer actor from The Witcher Netflix series - Anya Chalotra I think it was.She's zipping around with some fancy teleporting abilities, and punching and kicking. It's a third-person action adventure in a deserty fantasy world, part mixed with science fiction. Unknown 9: Awakening.18th October.–Robert Purchese19:40 pmUTCWe're moving onto Blizzard now. This is the company's first time back at Gamescom since 2019 apparently - I didn't know that.President Johanna Faries is on stage, reminding us that World of Warcraft: The War Within launches on August 26th, with early access opening a couple of days earlier. Will anyone be playing?Remember, this is the start of a three-game story arc that Blizzard is aiming really high with.–Robert Purchese19:41 pmUTCThere's a Warcraft Direct that's coming, apparently. Another company doing it's own thing.An Overwatch 2 x WoW collab is coming. Widowmaker is getting a Sylvanas Windrunner skin. That looks very cool.–Robert Purchese19:42 pmUTCDiablo 4 is of course getting an expansion in Vessel of Hatred in October. It's playable at Gamescom. We're going to see the mercenary companions in a trailer.–Robert Purchese19:44 pmUTC2much says:Blizzard bum me out. The high of Overwatch in 2016 feels like a million years ago and with all the stories that came out about that company, it's really hard to have any positive feelings towards themI hear you. I was just writing about Overwatch 1 earlier today. It was such a revitalising time for Blizzard.But. I think a lot of important work has probably been done behind the scenes during all of this turmoil. It's really nice to see Faries on the stage representing Blizzard, for example. I hope it's a significantly differnet company now, and the rot has been cleared out.–Robert Purchese19:45 pmUTCWe're getting a bit more detail on mercenaries in the game. We can hire them to fight with us - I guess they're like stand-in friends?There's a co-op PvE dungeon coming in the expansion too. I'm quietly excited. I really like Diablo 4, and the team has done some really good work making it even better since release.–Robert Purchese19:46 pmUTCKami says:I think Overwatch was also bolstered by the idea they'd recycled the content of a cancelled MMORPG (Titan, was it?) to make OW. It felt like pulling a win from surefire defeat.Yeah, another reason it was such a big win. It's a bit like how battle royale saved Fortnite, in a weird way.–Robert Purchese19:48 pmUTCThe First Berserker now, which looks like a very dark and handsome third-person action role-playing game. There's a cel-shaded look to the skin beneath all of that fancy armour.The world looks somewhat empty besides the boss your fighting.It's coming early 2025 with a closed beta from 11th-20th Oct.–Robert Purchese19:50 pmUTCDark and Darker Mobile?!

128,The wacky CDKeys gift card deal returns - get a refurb Xbox Series X or S for less,"Using a combination of a Microsoft Store discount code and the current discounted prices on CDKeys for Microsoft gift cards, you can net yourself substantial savings on both of Microsoft's current gen consoles. We've saw this deal several months ago, but it's pleasant to see it again, and allows you to save a fair bit on both consoles.Get the Xbox Series X (Certified Refurbished) for £321.74 from Microsoft Store (was £420, with CDKeys gift card and EMEAAUGXSX15 code)Get the Xbox Series S (Certified Refurbished) for £160.95 from Microsoft Store (was £210, with CDKeys gift card and EMEAAUGXSS15 code)The principle for redeeming both of these discounts is the same - as opposed to paying for the Series X or Series S by means of a card or PayPal, you can load up Microsoft gift cards onto your account to give you a balance equal to, or as close to the amount of the console's purchase price with the respective discount code, and pay for them that way. If you'd be paying by more normal methods, the Series X would be £321.75 and the Series S would be £178.49. However, the way of getting them cheaper is through current discounts from CDKeys on Microsoft gift cards.To break this down further - for the Series X discount, you'd need enough gift cards to have £330 on your Microsoft account balance which works out to:14 lots of £25 cards (worth£22.49each)1 £5 card (worth£4.89)So, that works out to £355 in terms of the value of those gift cards, which is as close as possible to the balance of the Series X with codeEMEAAUGXSX15at checkout. However, with the total cost of those discounted gift cards in mind, you're actually paying £319.75, plus the extra £1.99 to make up the balance  - that's an Xbox Series X for£321.74.For the Series S, it's the same principle, but obviously less in terms of the quantity of codes:3 lots of £50 cards (worth£44.99each)1 £25 card (worth£22.49)So, that total works out to £175 in cards, which is as close to the £178.49 price as we can get when using codeEMEAAUGXSS15at checkout. However, if you take the total cost of those gift cards in mind at £157.46, and then add the extra £3.49 on top needed to get to the purchase price of the Series S, it works out that you've spent£160.95..This might seem like a faff for the both of them, but it is worth it considering what you're getting. These may be refurb consoles, but they're Microsoft's own, and come with a full 12 month warranty. Reports I've read of people purchasing these talk about the fact they're virtually in new condition, to provide you with peace of mind.There's also no getting away from the fact that you can get next-gen gaming for £161 with the Series S, which is immense value, while the Series X at £322 is an absolute steal for full-fat 4K/120fps gaming - whichever console you go for, it's for an amazing price.","Using a combination of a Microsoft Store discount code and the current discounted prices on CDKeys for Microsoft gift cards, you can net yourself substantial savings on both of Microsoft's current gen consoles.

129,DF Weekly: a snippet of Black Myth: Wukong PS5 footage arrives - so what do we make of it?,"This week's DF Direct 'drops' a little early owing to a somewhat busy and congested week for us, and our usual two-hour-long chat show begins with a look at theBlack Myth: Wukongbenchmarking tool - and the fact that (when we filmed, at least), the developer had not shown any video footage of the PlayStation 5 version in action. Reviewers were told not to expect PS5 code pre-launch. However, yesterday, a short snippet of gameplay captured from the console did appear online, so we scrambled to take a look at it and append some thoughts about it to our show.Let's talk about the footage itself, hailing from PlayStation China (though we picked it up from the developer's feed, which linked to IGN China instead). First of all, there are clear issues with the quality of the footage. The appearance of developer IP addresses in the top-right may suggest that the PS5's system level video recording system was used, which was then re-processed by YouTube's systems, creating a very muddy picture, heavy on compression artefacts. Even so, we can see that the game is targeting 60fps, albeit with some heavy hits to frame-rate when screen-filling effects present on-screen. Black Myth: Wukong as presented here doesn't have any screen-tearing.Beyond that, it is difficult to tell you much more about the game when we have no context on how the clip was captured and what settings (assuming the console versionhassettings) it was using. To be honest, the murkiness of the footage has left me with more questions than answers - especially after carrying out performance analysis on the clip. It's not easy to gauge frame-rate from lossy video, but we've done it in the past with streaming services and the technique is pretty straightforward and boils down to manually scrolling through the clip frame by frame and marking up duplicates. In the process, we got to see how the game looks from one frame to the next and there's some evidence here to suggest that AMD FSR 3 frame generation is being used in this footage.DF Direct Weekly #176: Black Myth Wukong PS5 No-Show, Switch 2 Delay? More Zen 5 IssuesArriving a little earlier this week, it's the 176th edition of DF Direct Weekly, with John Linneman, Rich Leadbetter and Will Judd at the mics.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:48News 01: Black Myth: Wukong benchmark drops0:22:35News 02: Zen 5 launch unravels0:44:24News 03: Switch 2 possibly “delayed” further into 20250:54:49News 04: Unannounced game Deadlock hits 18,000 concurrent players1:06:33News 05: FF7 Remake trilogy third title to switch to UE5?1:12:32News 06: Man connects 444 consoles to one TV1:20:39News 07: Tango Gameworks acquired by Krafton1:24:26News 08: Forza Horizon 5 potentially headed to PS51:34:40News 09: Valve plans to offer SteamOS to other handhelds1:44:58Supporter Q1: As Microsoft increasingly goes multiplatform, what’s the point of Xbox?1:49:45Supporter Q2: Should Microsoft be putting older exclusives on Switch?1:52:10Supporter Q3: What does the DF audience have to look forward to in 2025?1:56:12Supporter Q4: Which graphically intense ports should come to Switch 2?2:00:10Supporter Q5: What are some technical annoyances you have with modern gaming?2:04:34Supporter Q6: What is the best way to achieve good frame-rates for PS3 titles?Despite the low quality, a kind of concertina strobing effect is seen when scrolling through the footage, particularly visible with post-process effects dominating the screen. Fast whip-pans on the camera show edge artefacts that present as 'borders' of a sort on the sides of the footage, but perhaps the strongest indicator that frame generation is being used comes down to the way particles animate. They are fully formed on one frame, then ghost into two separate images before resolving into one particle again on the following frame. A further piece of evidence is that the UI appears to noticeably animate at half-rate during the footage.If thisisn'tframe generation, I'd love to know why so many of the technology's artefacts are presenting in this mini-clip, but we won't find out for sure what the context is behind this video until we go hands-on with the game. At that point, we'll also discover if there are quality and performance modes and whether frame generation (assuming it is frame generation) is a user toggle. And of course, crucially, we'll actually be able to tell you about the quality of the game overall.Before the gameplay clip emerged, I thought about attempting to get an idea of how the PS5 version could present by using Digital Foundry's infamous 'Frankenstein's PC'. This is a Windows machine based on the AMD 4800S desktop kit - a micro ATX board built around the Xbox Series X CPU, running alongside the AMD Radeon RX 6700. In prior multi-platform tests, it has successfully delivered ballpark console performance and the results from the publicly available Black Myth: Wukong benchmark test are intriguing.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsFirst of all, the caveats: based on the proliferation of foliage, we expect that this is a heavy scene from the actual game, but without reference to final code, it's difficult to say just how representative it is. That said, I was able to run Black Myth: Wukong on our console surrogate PC at 4K output resolution using both FSR and TSR upscaling at performance and balanced mode. Balanced mode was uncomfortably close to 30fps at times, but performance mode provided a welcome buffer of around 20 percent more performance. This was on high settings, without ray tracing.Looking to test out a potential 60fps performance mode (remember, this was before we saw the actual PS5 footage), 1440p resolution with FSR or TSR in performance - essentially upscaling from 720p - couldn't quite achieve a locked 60fps output. However, despite looking blurry, it still looked fine, especially with Epic's TSR upscaler. Given the choice for the console builds, I'd prefer to see Game Science use TSR (tests show nigh-on identical performance, with a tiny boost seen with TSR) but if FSR 3 frame generation is being used, it may well be an earlier build of it that requires FSR inputs. Even so, given the fact I tested on high settings, there may well be further scalability that could see improved results. I didn't use frame generation at all in my tests, so if that is what PS5 is doing, I'll be very interested to see why there is the need for it.Answers will be coming soon though. As I write this, the PlayStation 5 version of Black Myth: Wukong unlocks in around 36 hours (3:00am BST on Tuesday) and bearing in mind the attention surrounding the game, we'll be doing our best to get our coverage done as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this week's edition of DF Direct!","This week's DF Direct 'drops' a little early owing to a somewhat busy and congested week for us, and our usual two-hour-long chat show begins with a look at the Black Myth: Wukong benchmarking tool - and the fact that (when we filmed, at least), the developer had not shown any video footage of the PlayStation 5 version in action.

130,Where's our Black Myth: Wukong review?,"Editor's note: Our fullBlack Myth: Wukong reviewis now live!Hello! You might be seeing a fewBlack Myth: Wukongreviews going live at the moment, and so we wanted to let you know where ours was.In brief: we need a bit more time with this one. It's a big ol' game, and we haven't had very long with it, meaning we've not had enough time to make significant enough progress for a full review.There are a couple of other factors worth bearing in mind. There are some quite tight embargo restrictions for what we could talk about in an early review for this one - though that's increasingly the norm these days really - and also, we've been informed there is no PlayStation 5 code available for the game at all until on or after launch. That doesn't necessarily mean anything should be read into there - code for one platform is often available before another - but it is just one more small reason for us to sit tight a little longer.It's worth mentioning the usual important caveats here: we're absolutely not entitled to early code for a game - review code is a privilege not a right - and publishers are under no obligation to make our lives easier. But, with the combination of a very short turnaround time for the PC code we're working with, the lack of any console code to check, the length of the game and the somewhat awkward restrictions on what we could talk about anyway, it makes sense for us to take a bit longer.You can expect our review sometime early next week, with the game itself set to launch on Tuesday 20th August. Until then, thankfully we've had a couple of chances to give you our thoughts on the early stages of the game. Ed Nightingale came awayimpressed by Black Myth: Wukong's combat in his first hands-on, and noted from an extended session with it earlier this summer that,while Wukong's a brilliant boss rush game, it may not really be a Soulslike.

131,DF Weekly: AMD's Zen 5 - why isn't there a solid consensus in reviews?,"In this week's DF Direct, the team discusses a range of topics but it's the subject of the Ryzen 9000/Zen 5 CPU reviews that made the biggest impression on me. Actually, it was a question raised by one of our supporters, asking about discrepancies in results between various outlets. We saw some reasonable, if modest, improvements comparing the new Ryzen 7 9700X against the last-gen 7700X, while others only saw fractional improvements: two to three percent is barely outside the margin of error in CPU-bound scenarios. So why isn't there the same kind of consensus we more typically see in GPU reviews?All of this relates to how tricky it is to get the measure of CPU performance in gaming - but the simple answer is that in a world where in-built game benchmarks only rarely stress the CPU, results will vary drastically based on the actual material being benched. Even the same game tested with the same components on identical settings can produce very, very different results - and this speaks to the diversity of tasks the processor is asked to tackle.Going back in time here, I remember benchmarkingThe Witcher 3using the Core i3 4130 up against AMD's price-equivalent six-core FX-6300. In cutscenes and the open world, the i3 was faster. However, in the dense city of Novigrad, the FX-6300 ran a lot faster. So, which processor is actually faster? It all depends on what you test, but I'd say that whichever scene is more demanding overall - which area tanks frame-rate hardest - should be the focus of testing - and that's the Novigrad run. However, both sets of data are valid as they both represent processor performance and both benchmarks together may illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different CPUs. The question is, how deep do you want to go?DF Direct Weekly #175: PSVR 2 PC Issues, Zen 5 Controversy, Half-Life 3?!

Another controversial topic is how you get the metrics to begin with. It's pretty much established now that to test, say, a GPU, you pair it with the fastest CPU available. So logically, to test a CPU, you hook it up with the fastest GPU around. However, what resolution should you choose? Some say that higher resolutions like 1440p upwards better represent the actual gaming experience. Others believe that the lower the resolution, the less intrusive the GPU is, giving you 'pure' CPU performance.I'm inclined to side with the latter argument, but in putting together the latest DF benchmarking suite, we provide 1080p, 1440p and 2160p benchmarks - and in many of our new tests, we're finding that with DLSS active, you're CPU limited on all of them, even with the latest and greatest. And with the arrival of upscaling technologies pushing up frame-rates, the notion that you're rarely CPU limited is certainly looking somewhat anachronistic - especially in a world where the likes ofStar Wars Jedi: Survivor,Dragon's Dogma 2,Baldur's Gate 3and Microsoft Flight SImulator can spend much of their play time at CPU limits.Hopefully this explains why we're seeing different performance deltas between various CPUs from different outlets - and it's a reminder that no matter how much effort any given reviewer puts into their CPUs, the sheer volume of potentially CPU-bound scenarios in any given game could result in many, many different tests. Therefore, in line with just about any hardware review really, it's strongly recommended that any purchasing decisions are derived from looking at however many trusted sources you may have.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsUltimately though, I'm not sure there isthatmuch of a disparity between the reviews I've seen. The key point is that for gaming at least, Ryzen 7 9700X does not beat the existing gaming champion, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. In fact, looking at Will Judd's review on Eurogamer last week, the numbers reveal that owners of existing AM4-based platforms are still very well serviced by the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, while those on AM5 can go for the top-of-the-line 7800X3D butstillget good gaming performance from the lowly Ryzen 5 7600X. Those two chips have something like a 30 percent performance differential between them but Ryzen 9000 processors mostly sit in the middle between those extremes.As to why the new Zen 5 architecture isn't providing the kind of stratospheric gains users were hoping for, I'd suggest there are many potential explanations. The new chips have been lauded for their power efficiency, which may suggest that AMD isn'treallytargeting gaming or even general purpose computing. Far more attractive are the datacentre and laptop markets, where power efficiency is hugely important.Secondly, in the transition from AM4 to AM5, the Ryzen line moved from DDR4 to DDR5 memory. We've seen on Intel processors (which support both) that the same CPU running at the same clock speeds can produce very different levels of performance depending on whether they're running DDR4 or DDR5. AMD has enjoyed that advantage with Ryzen 7000 vs Ryzen 5000, but obviously Ryzen 7000 and 9000 are on the same platform. Indeed, AMD recommends the same memory for optimal performance on both architectures.Cyberpunk 2077 2.0, RT Ultra, DLSS Performance - DF WEEKLYPlease enable JavaScript to use our comparison tools.With new Intel processors on the horizon, there's clearly an opportunity for the firm here in taking on the Zen 5 line with its upcoming Arrow Lake-S CPUs - supposedly a radical departure from the Raptor Lake chips with all the issues that have presented in recent times. We're certainly looking forward to testing them - and the upcoming 12/16-core Ryzen 9 9950X and 9900X products.Those reviews should be coming soon and we'll be expanding our range of gaming benchmarks to supportStarfieldand Counter Strike 2. This is all part of a truly exciting project we're working on at Digital Foundry behind the scenes, automating benchmarking and even automating gameplay on some titles in order to deliver those custom scenes that actually stress-test any given CPU. A good example of this is the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark above. Run the YouTube video and check it out. And yes, this is an example of the Ryzen 7 9700X beaten by the 7700X... and indeed the 9600X.In terms of our major benchmarking project, there's a supporter-only video on the DF Supporter Program right now that goes into depth on this - which brings us back to this week's episode of DF Direct Weekly: remember that supporters help shape the show by suggesting topics, commenting on news stories and suggesting questions for our Q+A section. And they get the show days ahead of everyone -join us!","In this week's DF Direct, the team discusses a range of topics but it's the subject of the Ryzen 9000/Zen 5 CPU reviews that made the biggest impression on me. Actually, it was a question raised by one of our supporters, asking about discrepancies in results between various outlets. We saw some reasonable, if modest, improvements comparing the new Ryzen 7 9700X against the last-gen 7700X, while others only saw fractional improvements: two to three percent is barely outside the margin of error in CPU-bound scenarios. So why isn't there the same kind of consensus we more typically see in GPU reviews?

132,The best-loved PC fan company made a desk fan - is it any good?,"Just because a brand does one thing well, doesn't mean they can waltz into another sector and do just as well, right? Noctua may be one of the rare exceptions, as the Austrian fan makers have adapted one of their legendary high performance PC fans into a genuinely decent desk fan following years of teases and rumours.The humble desk fan was first mentionedsix years agoat Computex, and garnered a lot of attention at the trade show for being such a left-field product. The proposed launch date of late 2021 came and went, so people started 3D-printing their own takes on the concept, integrating Noctua fans into desk-friendly chassis to get a sense of what the concept might look like if it was ever released. After all, if Noctua fans are known for being quiet yet powerful, surely the human face could benefit just as much as power-hungry PC components?Fast forward to May 2024, and Noctuafinally unveiledtheir Home series of products, which includes all manner of cooling options, including hubs, adapters and two types of fans. One is designed for cooling everything from consoles to AV receivers, while the other is designed for cooling people - and that's the one we have in for review.Yep - that does indeed sayNoctua Homeon it.After all that time then, is the finished article any good? Well, yes - but it depends on what you want to do with it. Despite its small stature, Noctua claim the fan can cool an entire room - and that doesn't line up with what it can actually deliver. Instead, it's best to think of it as a personal desk fan that you can use even at high speeds without disturbing others around you. It's certainly one of the quietest desk fans I've ever used, in keeping with Noctua's reputation for building virtually silent case fans and CPU coolers.Fundamentally though, a PC case fan is exactly what the NV-FS1 is: a 120mm Noctua NF-A12-x25 fan, bolted into a metal chassis, with fins on the front for directing airflow. Elsewhere, it contains the typical industrial charm Noctua has become known for, offering a chassis which is a blend of plastic at the front and a metal stand at the back for keeping the fan level. The metal stand is seriously sturdy, while the thick plastics used have a pleasant texture to them. The stand allows the fan to pivot and rotate almost 180 degrees, only being hampered by the cable that protrudes out of the back.Look at the adjustment!The cable arrangement on offer isinteresting. Originally envisaged as a USB fan, the finished product is mains-powered to allow for faster RPM figures and hence more airflow. You get a full assortment of regional power adapters, a power supply, fan cables and a PWM controller with dial for adjusting its speed. This full kit is convenient, although having the controller so far down the cable can be a pain in some setups. Amusingly, the cabling is exactly what you'd be familiar with in a PC, so they're thinner connectors than you might expect on a conventional desk fan.As the NV-FS1 is a full kit and comes pre-assembled, there's nothing to stop you from slotting in a bigger fan for even more airflow. Noctua says the kit supports both 120mm and 140mm fans, so you could conceivably slot the massive 140mm fan found in the veteran NH-D15 cooler to push even more air out. You can also purchase the components separately to build more desk fans,  make repairs or convert it to 5V USB power. Beyond the novelty of its existence, it's nice to see the Austrian firm leaning into the customisation and versatility you'd expect from their PC heritage.The NV-FS1 comes with these items too, to make it all work.Unfortunately, the NV-FS1 is far from the cheapest desk fan of its size on the market. It retails for£86/$99, which is hilariously expensive for a humble desk fan. That's considering you can both3D print your ownofficial housing for a fraction of the price if you've got access to a 3D printer, while Meaco offer more powerful and even wireless choices for £35 or so. TheMeaco 260cis a favourite of mine, offering the benefits of a small pedestal fan, complete with small night light and selectable fan speeds. Still, it doesn't have half of the charm of the NV-FS1.There's just something about the idea and execution of a Noctua desk fan that I can't help but admire. It's something the community wanted to happen, and Noctua made it happen. When brands are receptive to the needs and wacky requests from the community, it erodes away the typical corporate greed and facelessness just a little bit. Noctua makes for a marvellous case study for understanding a brand who not only make excellent products, but who are receptive to the very people who make the business what they are - those who actually purchase their wares, and use them. Without that, a brand is nothing but a name. The NV-FS1 isn't a perfect product by any means, but the fact that it exists still makes me happy.","Just because a brand does one thing well, doesn't mean they can waltz into another sector and do just as well, right?

133,DF Weekly: AMD's AFMF 2 driver-level frame generation update is well worth a look,"It's another packed edition of DF Direct this week, with our latest thoughts onStar Wars Outlaws, impressions on Nobody Wants To Die and the Visions of Mana demo plus a look at how ray tracing is being introduced into the next wave of EA Sports titles. However, the focus for this piece is on the release of a new technical preview for AMD's Fluid Motion Frames technology - AFMF 2. This is the Radeon team's second attempt at driver-level frame generation and if you have the means, I highly recommend checking it out.First of all, it's worth getting all of the caveats out of the way: driver-level frame generation can never hope to match the quality of Nvidia DLSS 3 frame-gen or AMD's FSR 3 alternative. These technologies have deep-level integration into game engines that allows for much higher levels of fidelity from generated frames. AFMF is essentially FSR 3 without the additional information given up by the game, so in effect, it works in a similar way to smooth motion interpolation in TVs. The game frame is rendered, then another is held, and then AFMF interpolates an 'in-betweener' image to sandwich between the two.With only screen-space information to work from, AFMF has to make a lot of guesses in only a very short amount of time, so more artefacts and errors will present themselves. However, similar to other frame generation techniques, generated frames are effectively strobing between standard rendered frames. The higher the base frame-rate, the faster the strobing effect and the less noticeable the artefacts will be. AMD typically says that 60fps is a good base-level frame-rate for FSR 3, so it stands to reason that AFMF would require a higher base fps level to better hide its inadequacies.DF Direct Weekly #174: Star Wars Outlaws, EA Sports RT, AMD AFMF 2 Tested, PSVR 2 Discounted!AFMF 2 is just one of 15 different discussion points in this week's edition of DF Direct.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:02:01News 01: Star Wars Outlaws gameplay preview!0:14:31News 02: Nobody Wants To Die impresses0:23:05News 03: EA Sports titles getting RTGI0:38:55News 04: PS VR2 dramatically discounted0:47:47News 05: Visions of Mana demo released0:55:47News 06: ROG Ally X benchmarked!1:03:40News 07: AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2 previewed1:17:45News 08: Destiny 3 not in development1:25:51Supporter Q1: Could you compare in-home streaming services like Steam Link?1:33:01Supporter Q2: Where is the console Minecraft ray tracing update?1:38:56Supporter Q3: Could upcoming consoles feature more bespoke kinds of hardware?1:46:42Supporter Q4: Do developers deserve flack for not optimising their games, or are more demanding titles just a consequence of graphics advancement?1:54:37Supporter Q5: Why wasn't x86 adopted for earlier consoles?1:58:27Supporter Q6: Could Microsoft release their backwards compatible Xbox titles on PC?2:03:29Supporter Q7: Is the M4 iPad Pro's display good enough for Oliver?However, the reality is that an acceptable base frame-rate varies according to the content you're feeding the frame generation tech along with the user's own perception. I was OK with the FSR 3 implementation in the console versions ofImmortals of Aveumwhere the frame-rate often sat in the mid-40s. And even with AFMF 2,Hellbladeis a slower-paced game, so the same mid-40s base frame-rate worked well enough in taking frame-rate up into the high 80s and early 90s. In my testing with an LG CX OLED display with variable refresh rate support, limiting base frame-rate to a max of 57fps-59fps kept me within the VRR window and the results were fine. I could play Control at 1440p, upscaling to 4K at medium settings with all RT features active and the experience was fine.Because of its driver-level status, the frame-rate amplification factor of AFMF can only be accurately measured via AMD's own Adrenalin software-based frame-rate counter. However, there's nothing stopping you running a standard FPS counter at the same time, which basically gives you the base frame-rate before AFMF does its thing. It's an interesting way to get a real-time view of the FPS boost you're getting.We've looked at AFMF before in its 1.0 iteration and while cognisant of its limitations, we could see the potential. However, we found it hard to recommend overall because in fast motion scenes - where artefacting could be most visible - the effect is disabled, which sees frame-rate careen between two extremes. AFMF 2.0 does not do this in my testing with a Radeon RX 7900 GRE. Yes, artefacting is more noticeable, but it's preferable to just turning off the effect instead.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsAMD has made plenty more changes and improvements too. Improved quality in frame generation kicks in when running at 1440p or higher. There's a performance mode which lowers quality but ensures a smoother ride on integrated graphics, making it a good fit for gaming handhelds - especially the Asus ROG Ally with its variable refresh rate display. AFMF 2 also sees AMD making claims about improved input lag compared to the first iteration - and it even has multi-GPU support, shifting frame-gen to an integrated graphic solution, leaving a discrete GPU to concentrate solely on the game. Radeon Chill can be used to limit output frame-rate - good for VRR screens which will otherwise exhibit screen-tearing outside of the VRR window (I used my Riva Tuner's fps limiter in my tests and it worked fine, but Radeon Chill should deliver better results as AMD would have worked directly on its integration).I'm also impressed that AMD has widened support with the inclusion of OpenGL and Vulkan API integration, on top of the existing support for DX11 and DX12. That's great, but I would like to see that expand still further - asAlex's recent piece on Lossless Scaling frame generationdemonstrated, the ability to apply frame generation to very old games definitely has its uses.So, how far have we come with AMD Fluid Motion Frames? We first saw a demo for AFMF 1 almost a year ago atGamescomand the demo we saw wasn't bad. The idea of driver-level frame generation sounded like a bad idea - and that first iteration had some issues - but ultimately, as a value-added feature where the user has nothing to lose by trying it out, we could only laud AMD for giving more options to its users. AFMF 2 can't fully address the inherent limitations in the technology, but this second iteration is certainly well worth looking at if you have a high refresh rate display. And yes, it's good enough that I do hope Nvidia will follow suit with a driver-level solution of its own. Driver-level frame-gen has its issues, but the more options PC users have, the better.","It's another packed edition of DF Direct this week, with our latest thoughts on Star Wars Outlaws , impressions on Nobody Wants To Die and the Visions of Mana demo plus a look at how ray tracing is being introduced into the next wave of EA Sports titles.

134,"DF Weekly: Some original Xbox One units failing to update, disabling most console functions","UPDATE 30/07/24 5:07pm:Microsoft's Jason Ronald confirmsthat the issue impacting Xbox One consoles unable to update has been resolved via a server-side fix: ""For players who were having issues updating their Xbox One consoles still running an OS build from November 2018 or earlier, this has been resolved. Thanks to the team@DigitalFoundryfor notifying us about this issue. Game on!"" This is great news and people buying used Xbox One consoles that haven't been updated in a while should have no problem using their hardware.Original Story:It started withreports on NeoGAFthat extremely rare 'new/old' stock of original Xbox One consoles - the so-called 'VCR' or 'set-top box' model - were unable to function owing to the lack of a system software update for the hardware. Used consoles sold on eBay and factory-reset also have the same issue. Based on our own testing from Xbox One consoles brought out of storage, systems operating on older firmware revisions error out when connected to Xbox Live. We've informed Microsoft, we're confident the problem will be fixed, but the situation raises awkward questions about the future prospects of console hardware reliant on an internet connection to fully function.Let's be clear about what we're talking about. As far as we're aware, the problem does not impact 2016's Xbox One S hardware revision. We're talking about the launch model, the set-top box edition. And it doesn't apply to all consoles - if every single Xbox One 'VCR' out there couldn't get online, I'm sure we would have heard about it sooner. It seems to be Xbox One hardware that is running older firmware that has the biggest risk of not being able to update. Two of our consoles are running 2017 dashboards, the other a 2018 revision. None of them can update - not from the internet, nor from USB via the downloadable offline installer.By extension, we can assume that any affected console that can't update that is then factory reset (perhaps by a user looking to resell the console) cannot function at all, effectively 'bricking' the hardware until Microsoft can come up with a solution. If affected unitsaren'treset, the dashboard works, games running from discs works, but anything requiring an online connection won't function. Without access to the latest system software revision, it's impossible to access Xbox Live or any of its features, and we can safely assume that digital purchases requiring an online check-in also won't work unless the machine is set-up as primary account holder or 'home console'.DF Direct Weekly #173: PS5 Pro RT Features, PS5 Pro No Man's Sky Settings, Fallout London Launches!Embedded - as usual - for your viewing pleasure, here's DF Direct Weekly #173.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:05News 01: Potential PS5 Pro RT enhancements leaked0:11:52News 02: PS5 Pro settings leaked for No Man’s Sky0:20:07News 03: Modder reaches 700Hz on CRT monitor0:33:50News 04: Old Xbox Ones suffer from update issues0:45:23News 05: Intel seeking to address CPU failures0:54:47News 06: Super Monkey Ball 50Hz physics tickrate fixed0:58:21News 07: Fallout London launched!1:05:51News 08: Castlevania: Rondo of Blood headed to Mega Drive1:12:49Supporter Q1: Should Valve provide community settings templates for games on Steam Deck?1:20:31Supporter Q2: Will Nintendo launch multiple Switch 2 variants at launch?1:25:07Supporter Q3: How can Microsoft deliver a capable Xbox handheld while keeping price in check?1:30:59Supporter Q4: Could Microsoft offer generic Xbox emulators to sidestep licensing issues?1:36:06Supporter Q5: How would the PS4 have fared if it only shipped with 4GB of RAM?1:41:55Supporter Q6: What do you think of stereoscopic 3D on PS3?1:49:25Supporter Q7: Have PC ports improved since Alex's ""13 Ways to End Lousy PC Ports""?Now, there's an argument that says that if the problem hasn't really been noticed and its online footprint amounts to a two-page NeoGAF thread (and in fairness, a smattering of Reddit posts across the months), logic suggests that the majority of older-style Xbox One units still in general use are updating correctly. What we don't know for sure is the precise criteria that separates a working Xbox One from a non-working one. In an effort to find answers, we petitioned our users on theDigital Foundry Supporter Programwho owned older Xbox consoles to attempt an update. The sample is small, but some updates did complete successfully. The evidence seems to suggest that a mandatory file in a firmware delivered in 2018 or later is required to successfully update the console.However, from our perspective, in terms of games and hardware preservation, along with ownership rights, the idea that a working console can stop working is a red flag. It's a warning about the future operability for any console that requires an online connection and a reminder that while you may have bought a piece of hardware, you can only use it as long as the platform holder continues to properly support it. And if it's happening now, what about 10 or 20 years into the future? I can take an Atari VCS out of the attic after 40 years and assuming there's not a hardware fault, I can pick up and play. Or if a retro enthusiast wants to do likewise, they can buy original hardware and games and have at it. Nothing can take those games and those experiences away from us.The transition to digital has already seen entire libraries wiped (3DS, Wii, Wii U) and the upcoming demise of the Xbox 360 marketplace is another reminder of how impermanent games can be. However, maintenance issues aside, the Xbox 360 itself should always work - something that cannot be guaranteed with its successors that rely on the internet to set-up out of the box. I communicated with Microsoft's Jason Ronald last week and believe that affected older Xbox One consoles will work again as soon as the root cause is addressed. It's on the radar. My worry is we'll reach a point in the future where the resources won't be available to address problems along these lines. It's a reminder that any hardware that relies on an online connection to function faces an uncertain future, sooner or later.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThis applies to all Xbox consoles since Xbox One onwards and also poses problems for the PS5 Slim too. The original PlayStation 5 models work quite nicely, I think. Most games ship on disc and are mostly feature complete. If a system software upgrade is required to run the game, no internet connection is required - the firmware can be installed from the disc. Game updates also require no PSN login to download and install, the disc itself acts as the key to grabbing the update. The PS5 Slim, however, is problematic. Even on models that ship with an optical drive, disc-based functionality doesn't work unless an online registration step takes place. If that's not possible and PSN is not available, there is no route forward in playing games on the system.And for those systems thatareaffected, what we'd like to see is some kind of protocol put in place to ensure that legacy consoles arealwaysplayable, whether it's 11 years (as is the case with the Xbox One) or 111 years on from launch. Ideally, that means a rigorous approach to ensuring hardware continues to function within its life cycle - but that also means a 'final update' strategy so when a console is no longer maintained or its required infrastructure falls away, users can expect a robust solution to ensure that the machine and its library can function indefinitely. Of course, in an ideal world, a mandatory online requirement for a games console shouldn't be there at all.This turned out to be something of a 'developing' story as we put together the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly. Initially, we discussed the reports, confident that the story was true. After recording, we learned more about how the hardware was affected by checking out our own consoles and then we found that both onlineandoffline updates were non-functional. We ended up re-recording the segment on Saturday morning. But this is just one component of another packed episode: we discuss the recent RT andNo Man's Skyleaks forPS5 Pro, the remarkable story of a CRT running at 700Hz and the launch ofFalloutLondon.

135,"Altar 1, Logitech G515 TKL and Iqunix Magi65 Pro: three fascinating low profile keyboards reviewed","Low profile mechanical keyboards are a popular choice for anyone that prefers the short, snappy feel of a great laptop keyboard but wants something a little more capable, durable and customisable. While full-height mechanicals were the first to go mainstream, low-profile alternatives are becoming increasingly common, and there's an exciting arms race resulting in some truly impressive designs.Today we're looking at three such keyboards: a refined gaming-focused board from industry giants Logitech, a fancy typists' offering from Chinese boutique brand iQunix and a weird, stylish and unmistakenly early Apple keyboard from London one-man-brand Electronic Materials Office.Despite being nominally part of the same category, these keyboards couldn't be more different in terms of their intended use cases - and that has lead to fascinating differences in design. Here are reviews of the G515 Lightspeed TKL, Magi65 Pro and Altar 1.Electronic Materials Office Altar 1 reviewiQunix Magi65 Pro reviewLogitech G515 Lightspeed TKL reviewElectronic Materials Office Altar 1 reviewImage credit:Electronic Materials OfficeTo call the Altar 1 stylish, anachronistic or just odd would be an understatement. The first Electronic Materials Office keyboard is also the first I've seen to use low profile keys that are also atdifferent heights.Most of the keys you'll type on are flat, but the function keys and modifiers are pushed upwards to make them taller, while the numerals and arrow keys are scooped out to make them shorter. It's a deeply odd arrangement, but to the designer's credit it does mean that you can instantly tell where you are on the keyboard - and centring to the home row is easy thanks to extremely prominent tabs on the F and J keys. Kailh Choc Low Profile v1 Red linear switches provide snappy response, though I might have prefered a more tactile or clicky alternative as an option.The rest of this 75 percent keyboard is no less unusual. Rather than a horizontal roller or a relatively low-profile knob for volume control, you get an extra-tall rotary encoder with a red tip in the upper right - the only splash of colour on the keyboard and the only thing preventing you from sliding this into a backpack. (You do get a reusable recycled cardboard case if you do feel the need to use the Altar 1 on the go.)USB-C connectivity is included but feels like an afterthought, with a constantly flashing Caps key when your keyboard is connected, with two Bluetooth connections acessible via a switch on the side of the board. There are dedicated pairing and power buttons, but no way to switch from the default Mac-friendly bindings to Windows equivalents. There's also no way to quickly swap the Function and Control keys, which for my money are the wrong way around (as Fn is in the prized lower left corner), but perhaps Apple fans would disagree.Even after using it for a couple of weeks, I can't get over the radical keycaps used in the Altar 1.  |Image credit:Digital FoundryIt's clear that the entire endeavour is a love letter to old Mac computers, with familiar fonts used across the entire keyboard and the (equally stunning)Electronic Materials Office website. As you'd expect from anyone putting themselves into the Apple echelon, build quality is superb, with a Macbook-style aluminium unibody design, and the keyboard is sure to attract attention placed on a desktop or in a coffee shop.Inside, a (reportedly sex-toy-sourced) microcontroller delivers perfectly adequate performance for gaming or typing at 1000Hz. I played through most of Armored Core 6 with the keyboard and had no issues after I adjusted to the new Ctrl key placement - thankfully, boosting in AC6 is less commonplace than crouching with the Ctrl key in FPS titles.What strikes me about the Altar 1 is that it is 100 percent designed for a very specific target audience, and it doesn't have any illusions about mass-market appeal. I'm sure features like Windows bindings will eventually come and that appeal will broaden, but for now this is a testament to the sheer force of will possessed by its designer to make whattheywant.A fullysold-out pre-ordersuggests that there are quite a few people that share that vision, even at a steep £349/$349/€399 asking price. I've got to respect the commitment from EMO to not only dream up such a keyboard but go on to fully realise it.iQunix Magi65 Pro reviewImage credit:iQunixThe$139iQunix Magi65 Pro is the first keyboard that we've looked at from this Shenzhen-based boutique, but it makes a strong first impression with an expanded 65 percent size design, copper-coloured accents and an aluminium chassis. I say ""expanded"" because the Pro model includeds an extra section on the right side, incorporating a textured volume wheel, RGB light strip, four media controls and an iQunix wordmark that conceals the board's 2.4GHz USB dongle. It's a neat addition for anyone that likes to listen to music while working or gaming, with the four controls mapped to skip forward, skip back, play/pause and mute by default.Back on the main side of the board, it's clear that iQunix are fully up-to-date withon-going keyboard trends, with Kailh-style low profile 40g hot-swappable switches with cross stems, PBT keycaps with an anti-oil coating, RGB backlighting, countless layers of sound dampening and a superb typing feel overall.Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity augment the 2.4GHz wireless, and a key combo (and keycaps in the box) allow for swapping between Mac and Windows bindings. Battery life is rated for 300 hours with Bluetooth and no RGB, while more realistic usage with 2.4GHz and RGB enabled ought to be in the 12-hour range. You also get a nice kit of added goodies, including a metal keycap and keyswitch puller that's the nicest I've ever used, a fancy coiled USB-C cable, several keycaps, a USB-C/USB-A adapater and a one-page manual in excellent English that clearly explains key combos and other features.This is a handsome keyboard that feels incredible to type on.  |Image credit:Digital FoundryComparing the Magi65 Pro to the (identically-priced) Logitech G515 Pro, it's clear that the iQunix offering serves as a surprisingly robust challenge to bigger name brands. They're able to deliver a significantly better board in terms of design, with a slight edge in typing experience and features, and only really losing out in terms of software ease-of-use. The Magi65 Pro can use theVIA web appfor setting macros, rebinding keys and adjusting the backlighting, but in my case this required a bit of fiddling - a firmware update and uploading a draft definition filefollowing iQunix's instructions.The Magi65 Pro is easy to recommend, but you should also consider the smaller$119Magi65, which offers the same excellent typing experience, minus the volume roller, media controls and space for the USB wireless dongle. Either way, you're getting a well-made keyboard at a reasonable price.Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL reviewImage credit:LogitechLogitech's G915 and G915 TKL are great keyboards, but a high price and only average typing experience have felt somewhat out of touch with the state of the mechanical keyboard market in 2024. The new£140/$140G515 Lightspeed TKL is intended to redress these issues, offering a somewhat simplified design and higher quality keycaps at a (slightly) lower price, while keeping the overall form factor and typing style that made the G915 so popular.The result is a keyboard that's very good across a wide range of disciplines. Like its predecessors, the short throw switches (in tactile or linear varieties) can be pushed rapidly and accurately in games, the TKL layout provides all keys in a familiar form factor but with slightly more space for your mouse, and the backlighting is strong and even enough for use in darker environments. You also get tri-mode connectivity, with Logitech's 2.4GHz Lightspeed wireless remaining the industry standard for low-latency gaming-grade wireless, plus Bluetooth for wider compatibility and wired USB-C for charging after your rated 36 hours of full-beam RGB use are up.The biggest upgrade here is to the keycaps, which are made from PBT instead of ABS and have a fine, grippy texture to them. The switches are also lubed from the factory, while sound dampening foam has been inserted to make for a deeper and more pleasant sound signature. The keycaps also use a more traditional cross-type stem, though it's not clear if These changes make a big difference for typing, shoring up one of the few weaknesses of the original design against the growing backdrop of boutique brands focusing on how typing feels and sounds.This is an evolution rather than a revolution, but grippier keycaps, sound dampening and pre-lubed switches makes for a big upgrade in key feel.  |Image credit:Digital FoundryComparing the Logitech G515 TKL versus the G915 TKL, the G915 does have its own advantages - such as an aluminium frame and a volume wheel, both of which have been excised in the G515's design. That's a shame - I'd have liked a side-mounted volume wheel as on thePro X 60- but you can make do with Function keys or rebind some lesser used keys (eg Page Up, Page Down) to serve as your volume controls if you prefer. Thankfully, the keyboard still feels as robust as before, and I'd much rather have the G515's typing improvements over the G915's metal design and volume wheel.Overall, it's a huge step forward in typing quality for Logitech, which has been in danger of being wholly eclipsed by more key-feel-focused designs from its smaller rivals. It'll be interesting to see if these changes are adopted by other Logitech mechanical keyboards in the future, as combining them with more gaming-focused features like higher polling rates or rappy snappy analogue switches could truly provide the best of both worlds.All three of these low profile keyboards are impressive in their own way, and it's been fascinating to see how each of their makers has shaped them to fit a specific use case. It's clear that the typing experience is becoming just as important as gaming features, and I'm glad to see the likes of Logitech really start to challenge on that front.Which keyboard are you most intrigued by?

136,DF Weekly: Intel has a CPU instability problem - and it's time for answers,"UPDATE 23/07/24 10:28am:Intel has responded to the controversy surrounding instabilities in its 13th and 14th generation Core processors. Here's the statement and a proposed resolution, but reports suggest the root cause of the problem has yet to be determined, nor has Intel offered any guidance on how to mitigate potential damage in the short term before the revised BIOS updates set to hit a few weeks from now. The statement reads:""Based on extensive analysis of Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors returned to us due to instability issues, we have determined that elevated operating voltage is causing instability issues in some 13th/14th Gen desktop processors. Our analysis of returned processors confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.""Intel is delivering a microcode patch which addresses the root cause of exposure to elevated voltages. We are continuing validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. Intel is currently targeting mid-August for patch release to partners following full validation.""Intel is committed to making this right with our customers, and we continue asking any customers currently experiencing instability issues on their Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance.""Original Story:It's a packed DF Direct this week, with 15 discussion points over 135 minutes - but it's the state of play with Intel's 14th and 15th generation Core products I'd like to focus on this week. I highly recommend watchingthis video from Level1Techsto get some idea of the challenge facing Intel here - it seems that the most performant CPUs within the Raptor Lake line-up are exhibiting instabilities that lead to crashing and despite the problem being identified months ago, Intel either hasn't identified what the issue, or - more worryingly - doesn't want to tell us what the problem is.The extent of the issue has been a hot topic of discussion for some time now. It's enough thatFortnite has a tech support pagediscussing ""frequent crashes"" with Core i9 13900K and 14900K processors and their derivatives, pointing to aRadGameTools pagewhich strongly suggests that forcing higher clock speeds and power limits on these chips (and others!) is the culprit. The problem here is that most of the enthusiast boards' standard BIOS settings do not adhere to Intel's stock standards - something that's been going on for many, many years. Suggestions are made on that support page, but it's only guesswork: nobody has definitive answers.I have some experience with this myself. Upgrading from a Ryzen 9 5950X system, I could choose between an AMD Ryzen 7000 system or Intel's Core i9 13900K. I chose the latter as productivity benchmarks gave Intel an edge. However, after a few months of solid service, i found that my own system on stock motherboard settings crashes intermittently in Adobe Premiere - while terminating the app or crashing completely while exporting a final video.DF Direct Weekly #172: PS5 Pro Still Coming in 2024?

And in fairness, while performance is impacted, my system is now stable. However, Intel didn't appear happy with these profiles. On a Gigabyte motherboard test system I have, I noted a circa 10 percent reduction in gaming performance when CPU-limited. After Intel 'disavowed' these baseline profiles, the Gigabyte BIOS disappeared, putting us back at square one. We still don't really know what the problem is - and more to the point, what Intel is doing about it.Which brings us to the Level1Techs video - and what a piece of work it is. Wendell attempts to source actual data from telemetry gleaned from game crashes, finding that the problem is far more widespread than imagined. In some cases, even processors running at Intel stock settings are failing. One of his sources -Matthew Cassells of Alderon Games- believes that Intel has shipped defective products and believes that all of them have the capacity to fail (ina video with Gamers Nexus, Wendell suggests around half of them may be problematic). The problem seems to manifest most frequently in file decompression tasks - heavy on CPU and memory - often maxing out all cores and threads in the processor. However, I suspect this is the most common game-related cause but my experiences in video production suggest the problem manifests elsewhere too.I feel the key issue right now is the lack of response from Intel on what is swiftly becoming a long-standing problem. The silence is baffling. Does Intel know what the problem is? If it does, why is the firm not being transparent about the problem? It has said that mobile processors are not affected, which does seem to suggest it knowssomethingabout the issue - so is this down to no supporting data on instability or does it know what the problem is, allowing it to be definitive about the laptop parts? If there are problems with a large percentage of processors, what is the route forward in making things right? There's the suggestion that a BIOS microcode update for the motherboard could be the answer, but equally, it may be the case that Intel will need to replace a vast amount of chips - an incomprehensibly large and very expensive endeavour.Intel has a Pretty Big ProblemWendell from Level1Techs with the Intel CPU video that brought the Raptor Lake instability issue back into focus.Watch on YouTubeSomething clearly needs to be done because while the problem remains unaddressed, users are far more likely to transfer allegiances to AMD when it comes to upgrading, while further questions arise with the upcoming release of Intel's Arrow Lake-S line-up: will these chips have the same problem, or is the issue limited only to 13th and 14th generation Core?. The signs may suggest it is architecture-specific as the 12th generation Core Alder Lake processors - up to and including the Core i9 12900K - don't seem to be exhibiting the same issues, but while no firm information is out there, the speculation will continue.Returning to CPUs exhibiting the issue, there are further unwelcome questions that need to be answered: are existing processor reviews out there (including our own) inherently flawed? Many outlets, including us, test processor performance 'out of the box' and the fact is that most enthusiast-grade motherboards run Intel chips out of spec, enhancing performance significantly. As Wendell points out in his head-to-head with Steve Burke from Gamers Nexus, there's every chance that a benchmarking suite that passed with flying colours at launch would no longer do so after degradation has run its course.So, what happens next? The longer Intel does nothing about this, the more the specialist press will investigate the issue and the more that those with knowledge - game developers or even people from within Intel - may leak information. It seems that the genie is out of the bottle now and only full disclosure and remedies to those affected can stop this snowballing into even bigger and more damaging fallout.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThat's just one of the topics covered in this week's Direct. We also spend time discussingPS5 Prorelease timelinesin the wake of some uncertainty discussed by Sony arch-leaker Tom Henderson. There's the train of thought that the console may be delayed until Sony has higher profile software to launch alongside it - but there's little evidence that this is actually going to happen, a scenario explored by Henderson himself in his piece.I'm reminded of the PS4 Pro launch back in 2016: Sony had little first-party support in terms of new triple-A software, but did offer upThe Last Guardiana month later, while existing games got substantial upgrades.Astro Botcould fill the same role this time around and I'dloveto see Sony's range of PS5 games receive enhancements.

137,"DF Weekly: ""You don't need an Xbox to play Xbox"" - we beg to differ","Another week, another episode of DF Direct and Microsoft's latest endeavours are our lead topics of discussion. Last week, the Xbox app for the Amazon Fire Stick 4K was released, backed by aggressive marketing from Microsoft suggesting that you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox. On a broad level, the message is accurate but based on the quality of service, things need to change significantly before we can endorse that idea, whether you're experiencing Xbox on PC or via the cloud.I bought an Amazon Fire Stick 4K Max to test Xbox streaming last week, but fully expected the experience to mirror the current cloud streaming offering available via an Xbox console or PC. After all, the quality of the streaming isn't really defined by your client hardware but rather whatever data is streamed at you by Microsoft's servers. The difference offered by the Fire Stick is, of course, accessibility. Similar to its endeavours in getting cloud streaming working on Samsung TVs, this is all about opening up Xbox to more potential users who may not be particularly interested in buying a console. The idea is sound, but I feel the execution needs work.Even though you need one of the 4K versions of the latest Fire Stick to stream Xbox, it's the same 1080p stream we've seen previously in our prior tests. Microsoft deserves some kudos for input lag response that beats its PlayStation counterpart. It's still noticeably slower than the local experience, but you can adjust to it. Mostly, it's fine, especially if you choose a game that runs at 60 frames per second. Microsoft also deserves kudos for an interface that works and a clear suggestion from the app to switch your TV into Game Mode (mine defaulted to 'Film Maker' mode on an LG CX OLED - good for media content, not good for gaming).DF Direct Weekly #171: Xbox Fire Stick Tested, Black Myth: Wukong Specs, First Descendant Frame-Gen!A video embed of the new DF Direct Weekly #171?

The stream itself is starved of bitrate, meaning that the quality of the image is relatively poor - especially when streamed to a large, living room display. Macroblocking is easily noticeable, even on static screens, particularly on graduated colour transitions - theStarfieldmenu system is a good example of this. Other content fares better (Forza Horizon 5looked fine), but this is in no way a replacement for the local experience.Our recent analysis of both Microsoft and Sony cloud platformsuncovered something else: although the Xbox servers are running on Series X silicon, users are receiving Series S versions of the games. Our understanding is that Microsoft is virtualising more game instances from the same hardware by using the less demanding Series S codepath for any given game. Bearing in mind that the stream itself is 1080p, the idea has merit - the exception to the rule being titles that support 60fps on Series X, but not on Series S. Doubling the frame-rate lowers latency - essential for a cloud system.So, you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox. It's true. The streaming system works, but it isn't a particularly good experience for Xbox gaming. The simple solution would be to increase the bitrate of the video and thus improve the quality. Stadia did it, PlayStation Plus cloud streaming does it, GeForce Now does it. It works and it respects the target display in a way that Microsoft's current cloud streaming does not. As things stand though, in a world where Xbox Series S is remarkably cheap (especially so second-hand - I bought one for £65 on Facebook Marketplace and £100 is an easy target price), the fact is that spending a little more gets you a far superior gaming experience: improved input lag, crystal clear imagery, no streaming image quality issues. And you're not just limited to Game Pass, but to standard Xbox titles too.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsBut you haven't needed an Xbox to play Xbox for a while - and you don't need to use streaming either. You can use a PC and although there are some exceptions (Halo Infinitesprings to mind), the quality of the Microsoft's PC releases is typically fine. However, as per our discussions on this week's Direct, we have plenty of gripes about the Xbox app for PC. It's simply not fit for purpose. While there's nothing stopping you bypassing the Xbox app by buying games on Steam, that's not really an option if you're subscribed to Game Pass - and there's the rub. For reasons that are completely unknown, there are problems with the Xbox launcher actually launching games: its primary purpose.WhenTomb Raider: Definitive Editionlaunched on Game Pass a few months back, I was eager to try a version of the game that was only available on consoles prior to its Game Pass launch. Even now, it's only available on the Microsoft marketplace and yet on my main PC, it never runs. The game's own launcher appears, but actually trying to boot the game does nothing. We've had similar issues with the Xbox app over the years, requiring a full Windows re-install to get any joy and yet it still hasn't been fixed.Is it a problem with my specific PC, perhaps? Well, the fact that Alex can't bootHellblade 2on his PC via the Xbox app suggests not, while the Steam download works just fine. It's totally baffling, as is the apparent inefficiency of the download process. Right now, Alex is downloading Forza Motorsport. It downloaded at 14MB/s  via the Xbox app, which is hardly disastrous. And yet downloading via Steam delivers 112MB/s and effectively maxes out the connection. In this respect, the Xbox app is at least functional, but disadvantaged against the opposition Microsoft is trying to compete with. And a launcher that doesn't always launch games? This is basic stuff.Hi-Fi Rush PS5 Review + Xbox Multi-Platform Releases - The Story So FarOur first look at Xbox multi-platform development: why did some Xbox titles launch on PlayStation in a better state?Watch on YouTubeI think what's clear is that Microsoft is entering a transition period - and an uncertain one. Moves like marketing cloud gaming and giving a  better value deal to PC Game Pass users compared to console Xbox users send a signal that the focus on the console offering is changing. All the signals from the platform holder suggest that Xbox as a console and Xbox on PC could well merge in the medium to long term.Meanwhile, the multi-platform game release strategy seems to be constantly evolving - and it's still somewhat baffling that some titles from Xbox studios are arriving on PS5 with advantages over their existing Xbox counterparts. And yet, I think the general trajectory from Microsoft is the right one. I think it is safe to say that the traditional console model isn't working for them and needs to change. By acquiring so many studios, including heavyweights like Bethesda, Minecraft and Activision, a multi-platform approach to Xbox just makes sense.However, I can't help but feel that this transitionary period could be handled better and returning to cloud streaming and PC, it just makes sense that if you're going to introduce new ways for people to play, those alternatives need toworkand need to deliver the best realistic quality - and with the Fire Stick experience and with the Xbox PC app in particular, there's no doubt that Microsoft could do better.","Another week, another episode of DF Direct and Microsoft's latest endeavours are our lead topics of discussion.

138,Is a VRR TV becoming more important for console gaming?,"In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we spend some time discussing the state of console performance and increasing importance of VRR (variable refresh rate) support for current-gen hardware in delivering a smoother, more consistent level of performance. We don't think VRR is being used as a crutch by game developers to mitigate wobbly frame-rates, but we do think that it's an excellent user tool in improving the overall performance in a relatively small number of titles… and its importanceisincreasing.So, before we go on, let's explain what VRR is. Typically, TVs operate at a fixed refresh rate - usually 60Hz. For completely smooth performance, a game needs to run at 60fps: a new frame for every refresh. A decent fall-back position is 30fps, where a new frame is presented every other refresh. If a game consistently can't hit either of those targets, we get dropped frames, presenting as judder, or with torn frames. VRR works by tying the screen refresh to the game speed. When the GPU has a new frame ready, the screen refresh begins. This eliminates tearing and reduces judder. On PS5, frame-rates between 48fps to 60fps look smooth on a 60Hz display, but developers need to code in bespoke 120Hz modes to unlock 'low frame-rate compensation' or LFC - which retains smoothness at lower frame-rates. On Xbox, 120Hz VRR with LFC 'just works'.Let's consider a few of the games where we consider VRR as highly beneficial to the gameplay experience. That starts withElden Ring, which recently returned to prominence via itsShadow of the ErdtreeDLC. It features RT and quality modes which run unlock but tend to hover in 30fps territory. Its frame-rate mode reduces resolution and employs dynamic resolution. The idea seems to be to hit 60fps, but it rarely happens on any current-gen console. Our advice to FromSoftware would be to widen the DRS range, since it spends so much time on the lower bounds. However, right now, VRR is the only way to turn its lurching frame-rate into a smoother experience. And on top of that, it onlyreallyworks on Xbox consoles via its wider 120Hz VRR support that accommodates more of Elden Ring's lurching lows. PS5 lacks that support, meaning that VRR only works at 60Hz within a 48Hz to 60Hz window - and that's not wide enough.DF Direct Weekly #170: VRR A Crutch For Good Console Perf?

In common with many RE Engine games from Capcom, it runs with an unlocked frame-rate. However, the game careens between CPU and GPU limitations, making a consistent 60 frames per second challenging - even with recent CPU optimisations and additions such as the ability to lower resolution, disable RT and motion blur. Again, Xbox in 120Hz mode offers a wide enough VRR window to smooth off the experience (just a shame that upscaling tech is still not working properly) - but it was only with Capcom's addition of 120Hz VRR support for PS5 did we find a version of the game that does at least present relatively smoothly. Capcom took onboard our feedback - and it works!Our next use case isStarfield's recent performance mode upgrade, whichBethesda Game Studiosspecifically released with VRR in mind. It offers a choice of visuals/performance and frame-rate toggles and while most of the game plays fine on all displays, the CPU-limited cities and settlements certainly benefit from variable refresh rate support - and again setting the console to 120Hz to take advantage of the wider VRR window via low frame-rate compensation is the best way forward.Perhaps one of the reasons why VRR is so important for these games is that only one of them offers the traditional workaround for demanding experiences - to target 30 frames per second. Starfield shipped this way and it arrived in pretty good shape and barring unofficial mods, it's still the only way to play on Xbox Series S. The RE Engine in Dragon's Dogma 2 hasn't delivered any kind of working 30fps cap this generation (the option was added in DD2… but it just doesn't work properly), while Elden Ring sees From Software seemingly unaware of how 30fps caps should work at all, based on the entirety of its eighth and ninth generation console output.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsAn honorary mention has to go to Immortals of Aveum - a game that runs (broadly speaking) in a 40fps to 60fps window, and where the inclusion of frame generation via FSR 3 brings up the frame-rate to a much higher 70fps to 90fps window. In both cases, VRR makes a world of difference - and again, the implementation of 120Hz support on PS5 ensures VRR isn't limited in terms of its application in the way other titles are.So, why is VRR becoming more important now? A few reasons come to mind. First of all, more games - many more games - are offering 60 frames per second performance modes and it's here where developers often hit console limits. Whether it's the CPU-heavy Starfield or Dragon's Dogma 2, these are games that either shipped at 30fps orshouldhave shipped at 30fps. On the GPU side, the likes of Alan Wake 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and a host of Unreal Engine 5 games are offering 60fps performance modes that attain their target frame-rates with variable results, depending on the game and the content. It seems like the traditional 30fps/60fps hard split so prevalent on the seventh and eighth console generations is over - but it's important that VRR shouldn't be seen as the solution in lieu of solid performance.There is an honourable exception, however: PC. VRR - be it G-Sync or FreeSync - has become an essential component of the format and in that case, it's not always about poor game optimisation. In a world where displays are now routinely running at 165Hz or even higher, VRR works simply in removing screen-tearing or v-sync judder. And on the lower end of the scale, If you can't hit a solid 60fps, that may be as much about your choice of components as it is about the game you're playing. Variable refresh rate is such a powerful tool then - and ubiquitous in PC monitors for many, many years now. It's in the world of the fixed platform consoles, often paired up with standard 60Hz TVs, where its presence can't be relied upon.","In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we spend some time discussing the state of console performance and increasing importance of VRR (variable refresh rate) support for current-gen hardware in delivering a smoother, more consistent level of performance.

It's a puzzle that has confounded many over the last few years and after discussions with multiple sources, including some of the highest profile triple-A developers in the business, we finally have some answers - and it's all laid out in this week's edition of DF Direct Weekly.In terms of technical specifications, Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the most powerful console on the market - at least until the mootedPlayStation 5 Proarrives. Its GPU hits 12 teraflops, augmented by a handsome amount of memory bandwidth: a max of 560GB/s. PlayStation 5? 10.23TF of GPU compute is available, fed by 448GB/s of bandwidth. It's a clear divide then. If we were to see that spec comparison in the PC space, you'd expect to see the former handily outperform the latter.Except that hasn't happened this generation. By and large, it's the closest console generation we've ever seen and in the bulk of multi-platform releases, the differences are fairly minimal. One machine may outperform the other, or vice versa. Sometimes where there are differences, it comes down to variances in dynamic resolution scaling - which often looks invisible in A to B comparisons. It's a far cry from the Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro face-off, where the Microsoft machine commanded an obvious advantage - or the PS4 vs Xbox One comparison, where Sony typically held a similarly noticeable lead.DF Direct Weekly #169: Dragon's Dogma 2 Fixed?

How can a less capable machine outperform the more powerful one? As seen recently in ourElden Ring:Shadow of the Erdtreecoverage, the frame-rate difference in favour of PS5 is surprising, bearing in mind it's apparently the less capable machine.We've heard some interesting theories over the years - such as how Xbox Series X's split-memory set-up (560GB/s of bandwidth on 'fast' memory, 336GB/s on 'slow' memory) may be impacting performance, but the number one reason we've heard from developers concerns the nature of Sony's development environment. More than one key triple-A developer tells us that the PlayStation GPU compiler is significantly more efficient than the Microsoft alternative, meaning that there's better utilisation of the graphics hardware. In general, we understand that the lower level API access afforded to PlayStation development means game makers get more from the hardware.The second most common explanation we've received from developers concerns the nature of the GPU itself. Mark Cerny himself discussed this way back in March 2020 when he revealed the technical specifications of the PlayStation 5. While the console may have fewer compute units than Xbox Series X - 36 vs 52 - the entire GPU runs faster, meaning that certain tasks will complete faster, better suiting certain game engine designs. The extent of this advantage was always an unknown as PS5 operates with a boost clock on both CPU and GPU - maximum clock speeds will be limited by a power limit on the processor.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsHowever, we've yet to hear any complaints from developers about the boost clock unduly impacting GPU performance. And in terms of raw numbers, there's an interesting titbit from the recently leaked PlayStation 5 Pro developer documentation: engaging the CPU boost option, which increases clock speeds by ten percent, only sees GPU performance drop by one percent - effectively negligible then.So, based on our conversations, the combination of a more efficient GPU compiler, lower-level APIs and higher clock speeds allows PlayStation 5 to match or even exceed the outputs of Xbox Series X in some scenarios. That said, of course there is value in the approach Microsoft has taken: by standardising on DirectX 12 and the DXR ray tracing API, there is a commonality with PC development that obviously helps game makers. And of course, Xbox does still have more compute throughput - so game engines that tap into that will see advantages. Additionally, there are situations where the Xbox ecosystem and feature set yields dividends. For example, while Elden Ring may run faster on PlayStation 5, Sony's limited implementation of variable refresh rate support means that we'd much rather play the game on Xbox Series X - it's just a smoother and more consistent experience.At this point, having heard the same set of points from a range of entirely unrelated developers means it's effectively case closed on this particular topic - and we expect to see a similar situation play out across the rest of the generation. PlayStation 5 Pro? That's going to be interesting. We'd expect it to lean into the same strengths that made PS5 competitive and go beyond - PSSR machine learning-based upscaling should act as an effective 'multiplier' of sorts on its increased GPU performance.This discussion is just one small part of DF Direct Weekly #169, where we have first impressions on the newDragon's Dogma 2patch and AMD's FSR 3.1 spatial upscaling revision (expect more in-depth coverage on both soon), plus comments on the new Dead Rising remake.

140,A change of role for Christian Donlan,"Hey everyone. Asmentioned earlier in the week, our lovely features editor Christian Donlan is soon to be Eurogamer features editor no more. He's leaving that role - but his words will still be staying on the site.From Monday, Christian - or just ""Donlan"" to all of us - will move to a freelance writing position, with regular articles for Eurogamer most weeks. He'll also have a new title, of Contributing Editor.The move has been in the planning for a while (so is nothing to do withmore recent changes) and is entirely to make sure Donlan has more time in his life for other things, including family. You can hear him chat more about it all in the next Inside Eurogamer podcast, which should be landing forSupportersvery soon.For now, what this means for readers is fresh Donlan articles still on Eurogamer, despite the change. And for us, it's a moment to simply thank Donlan - for the care and dedication he puts into everything he writes, as well as those he works with, for his time and effort in bringing new voices to Eurogamer's pages, and for a decade of brilliant words - with many more to come.Thanks as always for reading, and I'll leave with you a note from Donlan himself.""Hello! I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone. I've enjoyed working at Eurogamer so much, and it's been such a privilege to work with and learn from such kind, generous, brilliant staffers and freelancers. Thank you to everyone, and most of all the Eurogamer readers for putting up with me for so long. I'll still be freelancing for Eurogamer - apologies to those for which this is disappointing news - as well as a few other places, and I'm excited and nervous to be getting on with things.

141,Sony's new PlayStation 2 emulator tested - and it's another disappointing effort,"Through the magic of emulation, it's now possible to play a selection of classic PS2 games in native PS5 apps as part of the PS Plus Premium offering. For context, the first crop of emulated PS2 classics appeared with the new PS Plus tiers back in 2022, but the games came with major issues that made themhard to recommend, including PAL/NTSC compatibility problems, flawed scaling options and delivery in a PS4 app container. Sony has a chance to offer a substantially updated experience along native PS5 apps, but the revised offering is disappointingly subpar - despite theselection of some great games, including Sly Cooper,Tomb Raider: AnniversaryandStar Wars: The Clone Wars.The core of the issue seems to be a distinct lack of care when it comes to emulation, with some of the same issues we noted with the PS4 version of the emulator remaining unsolved two years later - and some new problems too, as John and Rich noted in the latest episode of DF Direct.That's not to say that these releases are completely without merit - you can play through PS2 games with PS5-native menus to enable game enhancements like rewinds or save states, customised controls and a free choice of NSTC or PAL versions, adding welcome options. The problem is that theimplementationof these ideas is often underwhelming, or even actively harmful to your enjoyment of the game at hand.PlayStation 2 Emulation on PS5 Tested... And We've Got IssuesJohn Linneman and Rich Leadbetter discuss the new PS2 emulator for PS5 in the latest DF Direct Weekly.Watch on YouTubeLet's start with the presets. In Tomb Raider: Anniversary, you can choose between four options: the default image, modern (which crushes blacks), classic arcade (which adds an unconvicing CRT filter) and modern arcade (which adds a slightly different unconvincing CRT filter).So far, so standard for official emulation efforts, but the video upscaling is significantly worse. Reports of unchanged resolution vs the PS2 original are unfounded but it's an easy mistake to make because the output is scaled in such a way that it looks about as blurry as the original. This is most noticeable on UI elements like text, which are the PS2 assets, but stretched (without factoring the anamorphic pixels that would have been used on the original hardware) and scaled with a simple bilinear filter for a fuzzy result. Given that third-party upscalers like the RetroTink 4K (and even software emulation) can make the game look better even on the original hardware, it's baffling to see how slipshod the scaling is here on PS5 hardware.Beyond these topics, there are also some small differences in how these games run. On the positive side, some instances of slowdown on original hardware are fixed here, with Sly Cooper running at a locked 30fps on PS5. On the other hand, the same game exhibited some glitches on Sony's latest hardware, including a level that played out without music.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsWe also tested the current state of PSP emulation on PS5, including Daxter and Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy. In Daxter, we noted jittery uneven frame delivery and we've spotted similar and even worse frame-time issues in other PSP releases on PS Plus.Ultimately, it's hard to accept Sony's efforts when the retro hardware community has collectively solved so many of the issues here - most notably developing a range of genuinely good upscaling methods and filters that you might actually want to use.Given that this knowledge is out there in the retro community - and no doubt within Sony's offices too - it feels like Sony simply doesn't want to spend the time to present its classic titles at their absolute best. To paraphrase John Linneman, it's like someone booting up an emulator with default settings and just handing you the controller. Sure, you can play the game, but wouldn't you prefer for someone who knows and loves the title in question to set it up for youjustright?","Through the magic of emulation, it's now possible to play a selection of classic PS2 games in native PS5 apps as part of the PS Plus Premium offering.

142,DF Weekly: Starfield mods unlock frame-rate on Xbox Series S - so how well does it run?,"In this week's DF Direct, I spend a bit of time looking into theStarfieldmodding scene - more specifically checking out mods that aim to bring a performance mode to the Xbox Series S version of the game. As we've already covered, Bethesda did a creditable job in bringing performance options to the Xbox Series X rendition of the game, but the junior Xbox didn't get the same treatment. We pointed out that this was a shame at the time, and the mods appear to suggest that Series S could have benefited likewise.Going back to the 'stock' game, it's essentially a match for the Series X version, albeit with very slight cuts to visual features. The big difference comes from the resolution. It runs at a reconstructed 1440p, using 900p as the base internal resolution. Bethesda maintains consistency by running at a capped 30 frames per second, the game rarely dipping beneath. The first mod for Series S I tried simply turns off v-sync, which also removes that frame-rate limit. So in essence, we're looking at something similar to Series X's 60fps mode running in the visuals preset (the difference being you'll need to put up with eye-rending screen-tearing on a non-VRR display).It's quite interesting to see that - similar to Series X - this mode sees the game careen between GPU and CPU limits. Dense cityscapes with plenty of NPCs are where the CPU is the limit - and a run around Jemison or especially Akila will see the CPU limit brought to the fore. However, in most of the other game content, it's the GPU that is the primary factor in limiting performance and here, the limits can change dramatically - anything from the mid 30s to the high 50s in my testing. It may actually go higher than that in some content: if you set the console to 120Hz output, a 60fps cap is no issue - the console will happily move beyond that.DF Direct Weekly #168: Starfield Series S 60FPS, New PS2 Emu For PS5, ARM Windows Gaming DisappointsWelcome to DF Direct Weekly #168.Watch on YouTube0:00:31Introduction0:01:53News 01: Starfield Series S high frame-rate mods tested!0:09:57News 02: PS2 and PSP emulation on PS5 analyzed0:25:29News 03: Snapdragon X Elite gaming performance disappoints0:45:27News 04: Still Wakes The Deep ships without FSR, DLSS, XeSS on Game Pass0:54:48News 05: LRG3 showcase features re-releases, remasters1:05:35Supporter Q1: How can I age as gracefully as the Switch?1:14:26Supporter Q2: Would you still recommend the Steam Deck over the new ROG Ally X?1:17:15Supporter Q3: Could the PS5 last 8 or 9 years as Sony’s flagship console platform?1:23:56Supporter Q4: Do you think a 1080p screen could be too much for a next-gen Switch?1:29:15Supporter Q5: Do you think any unannounced first party games will be released around launch for Switch 2?The Series X version of Starfield has its visuals mode, but it also has a performance alternative. Here, Bethesda essentially pare back the resolution to Series S level: 900p native, reconstructing to 1440p. While this can't address the CPU limitations in various cities, it does sort out the graphics limitations elsewhere - and it's an excellent way to play the game on Microsoft's premium console. So, the next order of business was to see if the same kind of reprioritisation is possible on Xbox Series S - and the ability to drop resolution to 1280x720 definitely does that - with dramatic effects.I actually tested this in full 120Hz mode, meaning that frame-rate could rise as high it wishes (measurable with our tools up to 120fps) and found that we hit a 60fps baseline on challenging GPU-limited area of the game, while the more constrained levels such as the Kreet Research Lab at the beginning of Starfield ran at 90fps upwards. This is a rather nice way to play the game - with one exception. The drop to 1280x720 from 1600x900 seems to be far more impactful to image quality than you might imagine. We seem to be finding the limits of FSR 2 upscaling quality, with some ugly artefacting. Even so, you are getting a viable performance mode - it's just that the trades are far more obvious to the eye than the Series X version.There are other ways to increase Starfield performance though. In fact, if you just search for 'Series S' under the mod menu, you'll find a range of mods designed to increase frame-rate at the expense of elements like draw distance, shadow quality and much more. And all of these mods will run on Xbox Series X too, not that we recommend them!This videofrom Fuzion Xbox Testing gives some idea of how ugly you can make the game in the pursuit of an ever-higher FPS count. In the process, mods like these reveal how open Bethesda has made the game - in effect, users have access to the console equivalent of the PC's .ini files.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsComing to the end of the Series S testing, it's great to see that owners of the junior Xbox can tap into the high frame-rate experience. However, there is one key limitation: while you can use your existing save games with mods without any problems, subsequent saves are moved into a sub-folder and Xbox achievements are disabled whenever a mod is in play. That's a shame for sure, which makes the case for Bethesda to add an official performance mode to the Series S version, so why haven't they?Looking back at the first test with the existing image quality level paired with an unlocked frame-rate, perhaps there's simply not enough content that gets close to 60fps to make it fully worthwhile… although I'd say that there is a decent enough turnout to make a 120Hz 40fps mode. Meanwhile, unlocking frame-rate and reducing resolution does seem to do the trick in terms of getting high levels of performance out of the 4TF GPU. However, here, the issue is that Starfield simply isn't a particularly attractive game at this point. I'm going to assume that FSR 2 is still upscaling to 1440p, so a more conservative 1080p output might look marginally better - but still not good enough, perhaps. Whatever the reasons are for Bethesda ruling it out, at least the mods are out there for users to experiment with.And that's just one topic in another packed edition of DF Direct Weekly, where John tests out the new PlayStation 2 emulator for PS5, I have averyearly look at gaming on the Snapdragon X Elite, hosted within Microsoft's new Surface Laptop, while myself and Alex share yet more of our frustrations with the Windows Store and Game Pass PC.

143,DF Direct: Nintendo's games showcase impressed - even without Switch 2,"Despite an early warning that noSwitch 2news would be forthcoming in their June briefing, Nintendo Direct was still a satisfying summer showcase with plenty of exciting titles. We ran our own Digital Foundry Direct special looking at the announcements, with John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie highlighting some of the most anticipated games - including new Metroid, Zelda and Lego titles.While the video version of that Direct is available to watch below, I thought it might be interesting to talk about my personal highlight from the show, and perhaps more critically, how the announcements we've seen today might factor into an eventual Switch 2 launch line-up.Starting off then, I was blown away by the Lego game:Lego Horizon Adventures. The original Horizon games - Zero Dawn and Forbidden West - have an unimpeachable setting, and it's fascinating to see this translated into a world of coloured bricks. Most importantly, there's been surprisingly little lost compared to the full-fat Unreal Engine 5 version of the game for PS5 and PC. High-quality Lumen RT reflections become SSR and pristine virtual shadow maps become traditional shadow maps, but the visual character of the game remains - despite the cutbacks necessary to get to even 30fps on Switch versus 60fps elsewhere.DF Nintendo Direct Special: Metroid Prime 4, Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Lego Horizon + MoreDF Direct. Nintendo Direct. A match made in heaven, and you can watch the full video-taped proceedings right here.Watch on YouTubeLego games have traditionally been some of the most faithful and fun franchise adapations, and it's clear that this title has a ton of promise as well - especially on Switch where the visuals and gameplay are a perfect fit for handheld play. I'm looking forward to seeing how this lands later this year, and perhaps in 2025 we'll see a visually upgraded version of the Switch's successor.Speaking of which, one big advantage that Nintendo has benefitted from with the Switch has been a huge back catalogue of Wii U titles following that system's relatively poor console sales. That meant a lot of genuinely good games that didn't find a huge audience, so Nintendo has been able to pull from that well and do (relatively) straightforward remakes and remasters to create profitable Switch releases. Going forward into the Switch 2, that well is starting to run dry, as John mentions during the Direct, with relatively few big or notable Wii U titles that haven't yet been remastered.With the Switch set to be around eight years old by the time the Switch 2 arrives - rumours place it near March 2025 - it's clear that Nintendo didn't feel obligated to push out a successor console in the same cadence as rivals Sony and Microsoft. That patience does have an impact on the games lineup though, as titles that could have theoretically launched alongside a 2024 Switch 2 will now arrive for the original Switch only instead or face substantial delays to wait for the new console.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsIt'll be interesting to see if any games that arrive over the next year bear any hallmarks of development targeting Switch 2 - for example, 30fps games from series that tend to stick to 60fps, or ones that run at surprisingly low resolutions but come with quite advanced graphical features. These sorts of compromises can be common to cross-generation titles, and as Oliver points out in the Direct, this could be one of the longest cross-generation periods for a Nintendo console ever.We'll stay tuned for potential Switch 2 titles then, and hopefully Nintendo will provide more information about the successor console, its capabilities and its software lineup as we close out 2024 and enter 2025. I'm cautiously optimistic that Nintendo's strategy here is a wise one, and there's always the possibility for both a faster-than-expected Switch 2 and a stacked launch line-up given the extra time they've given themselves to get the new console ready, even if there are relatively few wholly new Wii U titles waiting in the wings for their moment to shine.That'll do it for this one, but as always if you want to support the work we do, you canvisit our Patreon.

145,DF Weekly: Live stream quality can be awful - and it should be better,"This week's DF Direct Weekly is what you might call a 'come down' episode. After the highs of the Sony State of Play, Summer Games Fest and the best Xbox Showcase in years, we take things a little more slowly - though we do spend a fair amount of time looking at Ubisoft Forward. While the gaming content gets plenty of commentary, it's actually the quality of the live streaming presentation itself that wereallytake issue with. Why did it look so bad?For years now, digital showcases have had a problem: the state of live streaming technology on YouTube. Low bit-rates, low resolutions, inconsistent frame-rates, terrible macroblocking. It got to the point where we'd need to watch the content twice - first to get the news via the live stream, then secondly to check out the individually uploaded trailers which looked an order of magnitude better from a quality perspective. The good news is that things are improving. Streaming 4K at 60fps with decent bit-rate is now possible. We saw it with the Xbox Showcase. Even Summer Games Fest streamed at 4K, even though it looked like nearest neighbour upscaling of 1080p content. In both cases, we're seeing genuine improvement over their 2023 presentations.However, Ubisoft Forward was a retrograde step. In fact, it featured just about every poor practice we've seen when it comes to live streaming new games. The first time I watched it I was shocked and when we consider the amount of money it takes to make a game likeStar Wars OutlawsorAssassin's Creed Shadows, the concept that these titles should look so bad during a major live streaming event is almost inconceivable, so what happened and how can things improve?DF Direct Weekly #167: Star Wars Outlaws/Ubisoft Forward, Gears of War 'CG', Sweeney's ProphecyThe new DF Direct Weekly sees the return of Rich Leadbetter, alongside John Linneman and Alex Battagalia at the mics.Watch on YouTube0:00:31Introduction0:02:29News 01: Star Wars Outlaws demo reaction!0:28:42News 02: Assassin’s Creed Shadows unveiled0:46:55News 03: Clarifying the Gears of War cinematic trailer0:55:05News 04: Epic Games Store leaks upcoming games1:01:05News 05: Riven demo released1:08:59Supporter Q1: Has any console generation been more boring than this one?1:13:43Supporter Q2: Was Microsoft showing Series X or PC footage at their games showcase?1:20:20Supporter Q3: Is delaying a physical release the best option for modern games?1:27:06Supporter Q4: Will you make an updated PC Gaming on a Budget video?1:34:32Supporter Q5: Do you have ambitions for growing your audience?First of all, live streaming revolves around real-time video encoding. The source computer talking to YouTube is encoding video in a fast, none-too-efficient manner. Then YouTube needs to decode that content and encode it - again, in real-time, with minimal latency. Real-time encoding diminishes video quality in a way that offline encoding does not. Secondly, Ubisoft streamed at 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. YouTube is notoriously stingy with bandwidth at full HD resolution, resulting in awful artefacting. There is now 4K functionality, which doesn't fully solve the real-time encoding issue but certainly mitigates it, thanks to much higher levels of bandwidth, which translates into superior image quality.However, the Ubisoft stream had other issues beyond image quality. In the stream, Star Wars Outlaws had jerky camera movements, dropped frames and even screen-tearing. Two issues seem to be at play here. First of all, the egregious tearing seemed to be an artefact introduced either by the source computer tasked with the live stream or else within the live streaming process itself. Take a look at the separately uploaded trailer and there is no tearing, so something amiss happened not related to the quality of the source asset. What made it far worse for me as a viewer coming to the show late is thatthe GameSpot rendition of the eventwas the number one search result for 'Ubisoft Forward 2024' meaning that initially I was watching a second generation version of the stream, which looked truly horrendous.The stuttering camera and dropped frames in the Outlaws trailer, though? That's something different. We can only speculate here, but we've seen these issues before and if we had to put money on it, it would be on Ubisoft running the PC version and using a technology like Nvidia Share (aka Shadowplay) to record footage. The fact that the trailer itself tops out at 1440p resolution is also indicative. Regardless, the point is that Nvidia Share grabs images direct from video memory at the frame-rate you specify, but doesn't accurately reflect the pacing of the output - exacerbated if the game's performance level is higher and/or lower than the recording speed. Outlaws seems to have been captured at 1440p60, while the game looks to be running aboveandbelow that frame-rate resulting in inconsistent movement and genuine performance drops.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsAssuming it's running on a PC, the answer is to deliver enough horsepower to deliver the target frame-rate at all times, turn on v-sync and capture externally. There are numerous capture card solutions, but bundled software typically uses sub-optimal real-time video encoders. Our recommendation would be to invest in an Atomos Ninja V capture box, available for $600 (and often on sale for a lot cheaper). Plug in a fast SATA SSD and hook up the source via HDMI 2.0 it'll record your game in the broadcast standard ProRes codec at 4K 60fps - playable and fast on any modern editing system. Numerous flavours of ProRes are available of varying quality with the Ninja V, but anything from standard ProRes up to ProRes HQ is fine.Other relatively inexpensive broadcast quality solutions are available. There are even HDMI 2.1 capture cards now capable of 8K 60fps or 4K 120fps. However, all video playback platforms top out at 4K resolution at 60fps, so nothing more is needed. The key benefit is that frame-rate is capped andshouldbe properly paced (otherwise we're talking about a software problem!) but the point is that you're using a broadcast quality device for recording that's built for the task, and is actually capturing the output of the game as users would see it. As a bonus, you also have a ready-made solution for broadcast-quality console capture too.We have a further tip for game developers and publishers creating game trailers - even if your game runs at 30fps, we recommend capturing, editing and uploading at 60fps. It ensures that the manner in which a title presents on a standard 60Hz display is accurately mirrored in your final asset. Let's put it another way - if a game targeting 30fps has some mild frame drops, the dropped frame persists for 16.7ms on a 60fps capture. On a 30fps video, the frame drop either won't be visible at all or else it'll present for twice the duration - 33.3ms - making the game look far choppier than it actually does in person. Games totally locked to 30fps with consistent frame-pacing can look fine in a pure 30fps video. However, games with inconsistent frame-pacing at 30fps will look truly awful in a 30fps capture. Another bonus of a 60fps workflow is that YouTube allocates more bandwidth, typically delivering a better quality image.While it's Ubisoft Forward that has prompted this article, a great many have got it wrong in the past. Until we playedStarfieldourselves on Xbox Series X, every piece of media we saw - up to and including the grand presentation atGamescom 2024- was presented in a choppy state not representative of the game itself. And of course, Sony presented its initial reveal of PS5 gameplay in a live-streamed 1080p 30fps container with questionable video quality! Again, it was a case of waiting for the 'proper' trailers that followed to get some idea of how good the games actually looked, but first impressions matter, right?As of right now, I'm pretty sure the best way to deliver 4K at 60fps via YouTube is via its 'Premiere' functionality - which is effectively a standard YouTube video that goes live when required and where the viewer can't skip ahead when playback begins. This is the best fit for a pre-recorded show and you should get the maximum image quality the platform is capable of. However, it's not the right format for a live event, where in that case, a native 4K 60fps stream should be mandatory at this point. I should note that Sony did switch to the Premiere format for State of Play and has benefitted immensely because of it, while Xbox seems to have demonstrated that live streaming tech has evolved. There are solutions then, along with ways to guarantee the best quality footage going into the presentation to begin with - and we hope to see better going forward.","This week's DF Direct Weekly is what you might call a 'come down' episode.

146,Six ways to prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree - from someone who's played it,"Join me as I pull six things you can do to prepare for playingShadow of the ErdtreefromEmma's recent Elden Ring DLC preview. These are practical tips from someone who's played the game so if you want to hit the ground running (away from terrifying beasts) this is something you'll likely want to watch.Shadow of the Erdtree promises to be a challenge for those who have already completedElden Ring, so it's no surprise that it's subtlety recommended for players between level 90 to 120. FromSoftware has clarified that in order to access the DLC you have to defeat both Radahn and Mohg, with Mohg being an optional boss. The rough level you should reach before taking him on is level 90. Reaching level 100 takes roughly 60 hours, so if you haven't played Elden Ring before or want a new build for the DLC, you should start grinding as soon as possible - which is exactly what yours truly has been doing.And yes, you read that correctly: you have to defeat Radahn before you're able to grasp Miquella's hand and enter the Land of Shadow. At this point I'm not sure why that is, but I'm sure that all will become clear in the typical FromSoftware manner... by which I mean I will put on my lore cap and piece together the story from item descriptions and cryptic references.

147,DF Direct: Xbox Summer Showcase brought banger games but underwhelming new hardware,"Microsoft's Xbox Summer Showcase was unexpectedly exciting, with a torrent of impressive-looking games from a range of well-loved franchises and some entirely fresh titles too. Despite some misgivings over the future of the Xbox brand and an underwhelming reveal of new hardware, the games themselves were enough to carry the day - and the Digital Foundry crew has convened to discuss the highlights and lowlights in a DF Direct special.I won't go into every game discussed by John, Alex and Oliver in the 102-minute episode - which included the likes of Doom: The Dark Ages, Perfect Dark, Gears of War: E-Day andMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater- so instead I'll pick out some of my own personal highlights, starting withStalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. The original Stalker PC game from 2007 was janky, weird and completely captivating, so it's incredible to see a proper sequel finally close to the finish line. What was shown looked impressive - significantly more refined cinematics, storytelling, shooting and technology, yet with all of the grimy atmosphere of the original, from unknowable anomalies sparking away to a band of stalkers playing guitar huddled around a campfire. Heart of Chornobyl looks to keep the emergent AI, relatively wide play areas and verticality of the original too, but with everything realised in significantly higher fidelity.The new game is one of many from the Xbox Showcase running on Unreal Engine 5, with Nanite geometry and Lumen global illumination evident in the trailer - though it's not clear whether it was hardware or software Lumen, with hardware being preferred by Alex for scalability reasons. The entire trailer was also shown in what looked to be native 4K. That means that the Series X version of the game will likely look a fair bit different, and even PC users may need quite beastly hardware to run the game at that resolution without resorting to upscalers like DLSS, XeSS or FSR.DF Direct Special: Xbox Showcase 2024 - The Best Games Show In Years?With Rich out on assignment for IGN Live in the US, it was John, Alex and Oliver taking to the mics to discuss Doom, Perfect Dark, Gears of War, Metal Gear Solid and more.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:17Doom: The Dark Ages0:11:05Perfect Dark0:20:42Gears of War: E-Day0:28:53Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater0:40:39Fable0:49:43S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl0:59:18Call of Duty: Black Ops 61:07:17Indiana Jones and the Great Circle1:15:54Other games - Mixtape, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, South of Midnight, Atomfall, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, State of Decay 3, Age of Mythology: Retold1:24:36Updated Xbox Series consoles1:31:35Phil Spencer: more Xbox games are coming to other platformsWe're likely to know more when hardware requirements are revealed ahead of the game's September 5th launch, which is set for Xbox Series X as well as PC Game Pass, Steam and the Epic Games Store. Expect Alex to take a close look at this one in due course!Beyond the delivery of 'banger after banger' in the games space, Microsoft also finally detailed their next Xbox hardware revisions. This included two new models - a $449 white disc-less Xbox Series X model, a $349 1TB version of the Xbox Series S and a $599 'galaxy black' disc Xbox Series X with 2TB of storage, with the latter two offering double the storage of their respective original models.John and other members of Digital Foundry have gone on the record often to say that the 'adorably all-digital' feature Microsoft is rushing towards is definitely not a welcome move for game archivists, especially with platform holders being able toremove games from their owners libraries, and that same logic applies here. Still, it's at least good to see that the disc-based models aren't being replaced - the new models look to sit alongside the originals, at least for the time being.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsIt's clear from the pricing of the new models that Microsoft isn't aiming to disrupt the market with lower prices than their competition at Sony, but what remains unknown is whether the new models come with a die shrink that would make them slightly more power-efficient - and maybe fractionally faster too. Microsoft's press releasepromises ""the same speed, performance and features"", but it would be nice to see lower power draw along similar lines toSony's PS5 revisions- or even a sneakyOne S style GPU overclockto deliver fractionally better frame-rates.What we didn't see was something dramatically different to the current offering, both in terms of form factor (theleaked ""trash can"" style Series X) or functionality (the mooted Xbox handheld). I agree with John that this shows an understanding from Microsoft that a full mid-gen refresh likely wouldn't have moved the needle in terms of hardware sales, and therefore that their resources are better spent elsewhere - hopefully, on a really good handheld that is demonstrably different from what Sony is offering and what already exists in the PC handheld space.Of course, it's been a busy time for game announcement shows as of late, and the recently released DF Direct Weekly #166 centred around the announcements of Summer Game Fest.

We've seen montages of action from the games but what are they like in moment-to-moment play?Beyond that, we'll likely see more of the free-to-play Tom Clancy shooter xDefiant, which has only just been released, and probably something ofJust Dance, because Just Dance is always there. But will we see anything of the elusive Beyond Good & Evil 2, or the troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake? We can always hope.Ubisoft Forward: Official Livestream - June 2024 | #UbiForwardWatch on YouTubeOur live coverage of this event has finished.Key points20:02 pmJune 10 2024The show closes19:46 pmJune 10 2024Assassin's Creed: Shadows extended gameplay shown19:39 pmJune 10 2024Anno 117: Pax Romana announced19:35 pmJune 10 2024The Crew Motorfest getting new Maui island in season 519:33 pmJune 10 2024Avatar DLC The Sky Breaker coming 16th July19:30 pmJune 10 2024PoP Sands of Time remake coming 202619:28 pmJune 10 2024PoP Lost Crown story DLC Mask of Darkness coming September19:27 pmJune 10 2024Prince of Persia: Lost Crown free DLC available now19:06 pmJune 10 2024Star Wars Outlaws gameplay starts the show18:59 pmJune 10 2024The show begins18:33 pmJune 10 2024The pre-show beginsCoverageComments16:00 pmUTCGood afternoon! We're getting through it all now. Are you excited to see more of Ubisoft's wares?–Robert Purchese16:00 pmUTCAmbientInclusion says:So, at the exact same time as Steam's official broadcast for Next Fest? How nice of Ubisoft to make sure all these nasty indie games with their unique ideas won't stand a chance to get any attention! There's only one correct way to make games, and Ubisoft has been following it to the letter for decades!D'oh!–Robert Purchese18:24 pmUTCKami says:Hasn't Beyond Good & Evil 2 overtaken the record for longest in development? It overtook Duke Nukem Forever. And that's the only thing that made DNF interesting, it doesn't even have that anymore! XDGosh I don't know. I think DNF was 15 years. How long has this one been? I think I remember being at the Ubisoft event in Paris when it was announced.–Robert Purchese18:25 pmUTCGood evening. Here we are again. Ubisoft has always historically put on a good show. Let's hope the same is true of this evening.–Robert Purchese18:26 pmUTCAnrkist says:All I want is a new Trials game, to make use of the instant load times of ssd storage. RIP Redlynx.Ah, Trials! I remember visiting RedLynx before Ubisoft bought it. It was such a scruffy little place in Helsinki. That game was a firm favourite at Eurogamer!–Robert Purchese18:29 pmUTCKami says:Just checked, it was announced E3 2008, so we're at 16 years since BG&E2 announcement!Wow! Crikey.Ubidays! That's what it was called. I think E3 was on hiatus that year so Ubisoft hired the Louvre - I kid you not - to hold an event in instead.–Robert Purchese18:33 pmUTCThe pre-show beginsOK, the pre-show is going to be a load of old guff by the sounds of it. We're having a look back on some incidental details from games that have already come out.You know, I was going to joke that at least we weren't going to hear about Skull & Bones during this conference, but now that's not true. Any effort to get it in, Ubisoft will.Is it any good? I'm still yet to play it.–Robert Purchese18:33 pmUTCDurrel Brown says:You know I do not like SGF as a replacement for E3 for one simple reason. Every time E3 came around then mainstream news paid attention to games for that one time a year. Since this switch to the summer game fest and these individual online things that doesn't happenOh really? But then games are covered more thoroughly in mainstream press anyway these days, I think?–Robert Purchese18:34 pmUTCHey Ubisoft, give us a... wave.Sorry.–Robert Purchese18:34 pmUTCKami says:Skull & Bones left a lot of people salty.Haha - bravo!–Robert Purchese18:36 pmUTCImagine being on the Ubisoft water team in Singapore. I mean, it's really cool tech, but still.I remember playing the first Rocksmith at an event in London years ago. Andy Farrant was there with Inside Xbox before he co-created Outside Xbox - that's how long ago it was.I had the best intentions to learn guitar and chart my progress. I didn't.–Robert Purchese18:38 pmUTCWe're seeing a maid in a hotel corridor now. This is an indie gamesupportedby Ubisoft, which is interesting. This maid has been snooping through people's things. There are dialogue options. Lowbirth Games is the developer.

Oh! She's been spotted. The faces are a bit wooden.  She's - Sophie Roy - uncovered some secrets. Now the police are involved! It's in black and white in some places. There's a detective board. There are puzzles. This looks quite interesting.

This Bed We Made, it's called. Oh, you can play it now on PC, PlayStation and Xbox!–Robert Purchese18:40 pmUTCJust Dance now - consistently the best game ever. We're seeing Just Dance VR, it's coming 15th October. You can have an apartment in it, you can whack your furtniture while playing in it. Probably. I bet it gets sweaty in that headset.–Robert Purchese18:41 pmUTCIndie sizzle reel now - all games supported by Ubisoft.This must be Monopoly of some kind,  but it's all very 3D. Oh, there's the board. Monopoly VR maybe? It's very first-person. Oh, it's just Monopoly apparently. Coming September.–Robert Purchese18:42 pmUTCKami says:Monopoly isn't as much fun when you don't have an egomaniac in charge of the bank.Monopoly is a load of old rubbish all of the time.–Robert Purchese18:43 pmUTCI completely missed the name of this. King of the Hat! It's out on Steam, a multiplayer brawler. Looks like a good Friday at Four game.Bit of Rainbow 6 Siege now. I almost wrote ""sieve"" then; that'd be quite a different game, wouldn't it?""In Rainbow 6 Siege, there are always two teams...""""In Rainbow 6 Sieve, there are always two outcomes...""–Robert Purchese18:44 pmUTCKami says:Eh, I always appreciated being the Banker. Didn't even really play. Just sat there and everyone buttered me up for loans with decent repayment schedules. And yes, arguments.So are you perhaps suggesting you are the egomaniac?Giggle.–Robert Purchese18:46 pmUTCKami says:I Can't Believe It's Actually Tom Clancy!I mean, I guess you've got people watching, why not re-promote some of your games? Siege has been great for years. Not my cup of tea, if you're asking, but it seems to be very well regarded.Love that the dramatic voice over talked about the Siege esports winners as ""world wide icons"". Are they?–Robert Purchese18:47 pmUTCUbisoft apparently hosts a very fancy screenshot competition each year and then has a swanky party in an art gallery for it.–Robert Purchese18:49 pmUTCOoh another indie game, a stylish platformer staring a wombat or something like it. But they can change into other mechs and all kinds of other things. Looks like it plays well. It's called Biomorph and it's available on Steam.–Robert Purchese18:49 pmUTCSo Star Wars Outlaws is going to kick off the show in 10 minutes apparently.–Robert Purchese18:52 pmUTCI wonder in what way Ubisoft supports these games? Clearly they're helping advertise, but does it also help fund them? Or perhaps they're incubated at one of the studios? Hmm, no, maybe not that.We're seeing a game where you roll around as metal balls here called Battlecore Arena. A free-to-play action shooter thing. Looks fun.–Robert Purchese18:53 pmUTCIs this For Honor now? I remember when that was one of Ubisoft's stars of the show. Is anyone still playing? It was good once upon a time.–Robert Purchese18:54 pmUTCIt looks like there's a whole Japanese-themed addition coming to it. The Muramasa Blade. It's a new season coming at the end of June.–Robert Purchese18:56 pmUTCQuick glimpse at Riders Republic, and people riding bikes in the snow - inadvisable. Far Cry 6 flashes by. Xdefiant flashes by - I haven't played that yet. Skull and Bones again, and an influencer  shrieking. Prince of Perisa: The Lost Crown - legit good. Is that PoP PvP? Trackmania now, and another ridiculously talented player absolutely fizzing through a track. My word. Rainbow Six Siege now and a team coordinating a smoke attack, although they're actually throwing smoke at each other? I can't keep up. They're laughing though.–Robert Purchese18:57 pmUTCAssassin's Creed Mirage on mobile devices there, complete with choppy frame-rate. Still, it's an impressive accomplishment for mobile.–Robert Purchese18:58 pmUTCAh, and finally The Division 2. There's a new season coming tomorrow. They're unlocking level 40 and all season one content for everyone apparently - I think that's what he said. There's a free-play week coming.–Robert Purchese18:59 pmUTCThe show beginsRight! We're nearly at the start line. Let's go Star Wars!–Robert Purchese19:02 pmUTCOoh it's a live musical performance. There's a small chamber orchestra and a solo guitarist.I don't recognise what they're playing. Maybe it's music from Star Wars Outlaws?Now it's more familiar - more Star Warsy!–Robert Purchese19:02 pmUTCThe horns blair as we see some game footage on the screen behind. We're getting a montage of sorts. It's nottheStar Wars music though, but it's very reminiscent of it.The crowd cheers.–Robert Purchese19:06 pmUTCStar Wars Outlaws gameplay starts the showMathias Karlson, game director at Massive Entertainment, is going to talk us through the Star Wars Outlaws gameplay we're seeing.One of our motivations for exploring is to find elusive Experts scattered across the galaxy. We're looking for a gunslinger to teach us some new tricks, so main character Kay Vess is going to go to the famed Mos Eisley Cantina to find them.But we're not there yet. We're in a bit of a dive of a market - in the covered slums. It's misty and literally shady.Our ship, the Trailblazer, is apparently the last of its kind. The production values as we run on board are wonderful. It's a sumptuos presentation. We press go and transition into aerial gameplay as we fly out of the hangar. The moment we do, we get a distress signal saying someone is under attack and they want our assistance, so we hop to it.It's simple-looking aerial dogfighting - you fly around and lock enemies in your targeting reticules and then blast them down. You have a few things you can do but this is no flight sim. Voice over plays over the top.In space, your actions have consequences and can influence your reputation with syndicates. We've impressed one of them, apparently. Then we warp outta there.–Robert Purchese19:13 pmUTCWe're heading to the desert planet of Tattooine. Atmospheric music - that pensive music of Star Wars - ponders along in the background. There's Mos Eisley, ""the legendary hub of scum and villainy"".It's sun-baked and packed with detail. Machines intermingle with sand. Naturally, the Hutt Cartel is a big presence here. The footage is montaging a bit now so we can see the various angles of Mos Eisley. We go to the cantina and then in the blink of an eye we're on a speeder bike of some description, kicking up dust as we speed into the desert.We've reached our destination. We're looking for a storehouse - a fortress, really. Kay is using binoculars to scout the walls before heading there. Cut to Kay grappling up a platform she just spotted with her binocs. Now she's crouching - the universal language of stealth, and hopping over rocks to get closer to unaware enemies.She sends her companion creature Nix to attack, before she wades in with some solid uppercuts. She asks Nix to scan the area with some kind of extroardinary senses. Then she's in an punching a Rhodian in the face. Picking a lock, now, to steal some intele. An enemy walks in and we've been spotted. Kay fires from the hip but there's a lot of resistance outside. ""We're in trouble, pal."" You sure are.A kind of dog lizard grabs her arm and hangs on, until she boots it off. She's running and gunning with her pistol. It's active, it's got forward momentum. Now, she's otu of there, and we cut to a hut in the dark. It's the bounty hunter we're looking for, a withered old lizard-looking character.We're asking them to teach us, and it looks like there's a showdown test before they will. It's a side-quest of sorts, basically, and we're promised many, many more. I'm exhausted just thiking about it.–Robert Purchese19:16 pmUTCBack in the theatre, the audience is clapping and whooping. Julian Gerighty, the creative director of Massive Entertainment, is now on stage.He's giving a flavourful blurb about the position we find ourselves in, in the game. We've been asked to pull of one of the greatest heists of all time, he tells us. We'll have to seek out experts all across the Outer Rim. Follow rumours and tip-offs, he says, making it sound like they're mechanics in the game. But we're a wanted criminal in the game, he reminds us, so it's in our interest not to stick around anywhere for too long.Syndicates have their hands in every part of the galaxy, and if we build our reptutation with them we can earn lucrative rewards. Or we can double-cross them to land an even bigger score, if we dare. He's now thanking Ubisoft Massive and all the partner studios for the game. We're going to get another look at it apparently.""If you're willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of opportunity,"" he says, and walks off.–Robert Purchese19:19 pmUTCWe're getting more of a montage trailer now. ""Welcome to the first open-world Star Wars game,"" the voice says. Is it? What about Star Wars: The Old Republic - doesn't that count? I'm being fussy; I know what he means.We're learning a bit about Kay Vess and her companion Nix, who have been partners since childhood apparently. Nix can play dead to distract enemies. Nix can drop objects on enemies, like light bulbs. Kay's got a mini-gun of sorts now.Ooh, we're seeing a timed dialogue option to double-cross people or not. Imagine Han in the Cantina and having a timed countdown before he shoots under the table.There's Jabba. Jabba! No lightsabers yet, but we're hearing about the Empire hunting us. There's a TIE Fighter. There are some storm troops - I bet they'll die easily.The environments look nice. It's a nice look at the wider world of Star Wars. I hope it's not just big for the sake of it though. It has to be big enough to support your speeder, which means there might be lots of emptiness?–Robert Purchese19:20 pmUTCKami says:They're going all in on this one I guess.It does feel that way!Reminder that the game comes out 30th August.–Robert Purchese19:20 pmUTCWe've moved on now, to XDefiant it looks like.–Robert Purchese19:21 pmUTCHas anyone played this? There's new content coming. Capture the Flag! Remember when that was a new thing?It's a fleeting montage-kind of update, this. 2nd July, the new season comes.–Robert Purchese19:24 pmUTCSkull & Bones now - there's no shaking it.Neven Dravinski, senior producer at Ubisoft Singapore is here to talk about it. Season 2 Chorus of Havoc has just begun. Oh wow it has the megalodon in it! I feel bad for being so snarky now. And were those musical ships?Season three, Into the Dragons Wake will follow it. It's an Aisan-themed expansion by the looks of it. There's a flying dragon sea monster. There's a new 5v5 PvP mode.That's it.–Robert Purchese19:27 pmUTCPrince of Persia: Lost Crown free DLC available nowGwenn Berhault is on stage now, brand director for Prince of Persia. She's giving a rundown of the PoP history. To celebrate the 35th anniversary, they wanted to give us new, ""exhilarating"" adventures. She's referencing the brilliant Lost Crown. Ubisoft Montpelier has a treat for us apparently.First title update, available for free: Divine Trials. Combat challenges, revisited bosses, puzzle challenges, platform challenges, new amulets, new outfits. It's available now.–Robert Purchese19:28 pmUTCPoP Lost Crown story DLC Mask of Darkness coming SeptemberMask of Darkess story DLC coming in September.–Robert Purchese19:29 pmUTCThe Rogue Prince of Persia from Evil Empire now. Christian Donlan really liked this.They're announcing the first update, The Temple of Fire. It's a new biome. There are new mobs, new weapons. It's not clear if it's available now.–Robert Purchese19:30 pmUTCPoP Sands of Time remake coming 2026Finally, we're going to be left with a ""love letter"" to one of their best games in the series. It's Sands of Time - it has to be! The remake!We see a candle burning in a trailer and then... We see the horrid words ""2026"". We've got a while to wait, apparently.–Robert Purchese19:33 pmUTCAvatar DLC The Sky Breaker coming 16th JulyBrief Avatar spot there.A Story pack The Sky Breaker is coming 16th July, and we're seeing a glimpse of it. We're galloping around more open plains now. A ship crashes down from above. Now there's fire and terror. But yes, more open spaces, more fields, and more humans to kill by the looks of things. Perfect.–Robert Purchese19:35 pmUTCThe Crew Motorfest getting new Maui island in season 5Gregory Corgie from The Crew team here now. Season 4 is going to be the final update of year one. It's going to be all about car customisation.We're getting a first look at the year to come. We see seasons 5, 6, and 7 mentioned. The new island of Maui is coming with the launch of season five. Made in Japan volume two is coming then too.–Robert Purchese19:36 pmUTCThe Chase Squad is coming to The Crew as premium content in November. We saw a trailer with a dog in it. Does that help?–Robert Purchese19:37 pmUTCNow, a man in a toga proclaiming to cows that we're on the cusp of a new age. Someone got paid to do this, you know.–Robert Purchese19:39 pmUTCAnno 117: Pax Romana announcedIt's a new Anno game coming next year.Anno 117: Pax Romana, it's called. It's coming out on both PC and console.We're going to get a Roman gaming experience unlike anythign we've ever played, apparently. For the first time, we can choose our starting location. We can start in Albion if we like, AKA England. But who would want to start there?–Robert Purchese19:39 pmUTCThat's it for Anno, I guess. They should have called it ""Anno what you did last summer"". No?–Robert Purchese19:40 pmUTCQuick sizzle reel of Ubisoft games now. I guess we're building up to Assassin's Creed.–Robert Purchese19:41 pmUTCDo you remember when Ubisoft announced the first Assassin's Creed game? It'd be a horrid place to set a game in 2024, but I remember it being very exciting at the time. That live gameplay demo looked unreal.–Robert Purchese19:42 pmUTCOoh what are we seeing now. Ah, this explains the sizzle reel. The stage has been cleared to bring on some drummers. They're in the dark, lit in red. Thumpy, thump, thump. It's the Assassin's Creed: Shadows music.–Robert Purchese19:42 pmUTCMalek86 says:How do you make Monopoly exciting? That's right, you can't, so I can understand why they didn't even bother to try.Ha!–Robert Purchese19:43 pmUTCCome on, show us some Shadows gameplay, you cowards.–Robert Purchese19:46 pmUTCAssassin's Creed: Shadows extended gameplay shownCharles Benoit, game director on stage now. This is their dream project he says. I bet he says that about all the eras. Someone shouts ""thank you!"" from the audience. I wonder if it's Chris Tapsell.He's setting the scene about the period, and the duality between the shinobi and the samurai - and we'll play as both of them. Naoe, remeber, is shinobi, she's a young woman forced by war to learn the arts of deception. On the other hand, we'll play as Yasuke, a real figure from history, a samurai.They'll both have their own stories and their own views on the world. Once they're allied, you can switch freely between them both, apparently. One is a more direct, one is more stealthy.We're going to feel time passing. There's going to be a full year cycle! That's cool. So we'll have the seasons. Ice will prevent us going under water in the winter. Heavy rain will help us blend into our environments. It's good to see all those many thousands of people who worked on the game given something to do.Each day and season will bring its own challenges.He's going to share an extended look at gameplay.–Robert Purchese19:51 pmUTCHere we go. Oh and it's all retro pixelated style! No no, not really.We're on a horse with Yasuke, who's galloping around and talking to himself. He treads his own path he says, as he narrates the landscape around him. Always monologuing, these samurai, aren't they? He's trotting through farms into a village. People mill around, like extras. They bow to him as he walks past - they recognising him as their social better, as it were.He is decked out head to toe in samurai armour. A dog approaches him and he pets it. A child begs for the samurai's attention. He follows them. The ground is wet and muddy.We're talking to an older lady who I suppose is going to give us a mission. Yasuke talks to her, now without his helmet on. He's been given a mission to assassinate someone called Fujioka.A little to-do list pops up on the screen. The town he's walking through - or city, perhaps - is very detailed. There are lots of people in it. Yasuke is still monologuing.Oh, someone is telling us to step away, but there's no chance we're going to. A fight ensues. Yasuke is using his club to batter the shit out of this enemy. Jesus christ - they had no chance. He swings like he's playing baseball and practically swipes the enemy's head off. Brutal.Head stamp there, just to finish it off.–Robert Purchese19:54 pmUTCNot so much skilful samurai, more wrecking ball.More combat now. We get Japanese-style music with a beat underneath - it's catchy. Oh, now a sword is drawn! It's the boss - it's the guy we're looking for. They're fighting each other but also talking a bit. Oh, we kill him with a powerful stab and then the screen goes into a parchment-like mode and then we chop his head off.Someone runs from the crowd to attack us but then out jumps Naoe to help us. They're talking to each other. Yasuke is a third taller than her - he's a beast. We see the map. It suggests a very large world.Ah, we're seeing a Yasuke or Naoe choice now - who do you want to play this section as?For demo purposes, we're now switching to Naoe.–Robert Purchese19:57 pmUTCNaoe is perched on a rooftop - this is much more the acrobatic Assassin's Creed we're used to. She's crawling through long grass. She's also talking to herself. She distracts  aguard with a stone or something, then she's on him, rolling over him and killing him in the same fluid move. Then a pounce and a blade from the wrist into someone's neck - kablam! They're gone.Back up onto the tiled roof. She jumps, lands on an enemy and stabs them at the same time. We see patrols below, but Naoe is running through people's back gardens. An Assassinate prompt flashes up when we get near to enemies. This time, though, she knocks a lady out, by strangling them.She must have good quads, all this crouching. Oh nice! She stabs through one of those paper dividers.–Robert Purchese19:59 pmUTCNaoe zips up and onto the ceiling to hide as someone enters the building. We overhear a guard being berated for not saving the person Yasuke killed earlier. That's the person we want - the person doing the berating. Throwing knife in the back of someone's head: check.We descend into the water, crawling along under cover. We use a bambo straw to breathe with! Then we're up out of the water, slitting the achilles and then the throat. Now we have an open fight. We're using a chain to attack multiple enemies at once. She takes one down and then she backs out, leaping up the wall onto the rooftop again as torrential rain blows in. Then she's out of the window and we're montaging.That must be it.–Robert Purchese20:00 pmUTCI mean, it looks great. It looks like a proper deep adventure, and I'm intrigued by the dual perspectives. I'm a bit worn out by samurai of late, though.More montaging now. I guess that's probably a wrap?–Robert Purchese20:02 pmUTCThe show closesI wonder if there's a big finish in this. Yves! Is Yves Guillemot, the co-founder and CEO on stage now. He's got all the Ubisoft team - the Ubisoft team at the show - on the stage behind him. There are a couple of storm troopers there too. He's thanking the whole team. He's also thanking the players.Thank you for watching, he says. And I think that really is it. They're milling off stage. No big surprise. Nope.That really is it.–Robert Purchese20:04 pmUTCWell. That's what we expected I suppose. It wasn't particularly exciting but we did get a good look at two of this year's most prominent games. We also got a release window of sorts for the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which I think is real - a 2026 release date doesn't really inspire much confidence. But they believe in it enough to announce it.–Robert Purchese20:06 pmUTCDurrel Brown says:Was this the last big show this year?Pretty much. There's a Nintendo Direct to follow later in June I think. I'm not sure when.–Robert Purchese20:07 pmUTCKami says:At this point BGE2 feels like an elaborate joke to set the longest development cycle record high enough that no-one will be able to assail it.Fascinating, isn't it? I wonder how much of it was really ever made.–Robert Purchese20:09 pmUTCThank you everyone for tuning in today. Heart rate unaffected by this showcase. I hope you all have a lovely evening. Bye from me for now!–Robert Purchese20:10 pmUTCOh, shout out toChris' preview of Star Wars Outlawsthat's just gone up. He doesn't sound very impressed.–Robert PurcheseLoad more commentsLoading","We've had a weekend of Summer Game Fest coverage and we're still not done. This evening, it's Ubisoft's turn.

The show starts at 6pm UK time and we'll be covering all the major talking points right here, in a blow-by-blow account. As ever, you can watch the stream right here and chat about everything in the comments with us below.What do we expect to see?Indiana Jones and the Great Circlefrom Wolfenstein developer MachineGames, the Shattered Space expansion forStarfield, and possiblyFlight Simulator 2024. I'm also holding out hope for a proper look at the Fable reboot, and there's a chance we may see the new Gears of War game that The Coalition has been working on. That's a pretty solid line-up, if it all comes to pass.However, it's against the backdrop of studio closures and redundancies that Microsoft takes to the stage, so it'll be interesting to see if there's any reaction or reference to that. Microsoft has also made some bold moves in recent months to make previously Xbox-exclusive games available on PlayStation, so I wonder whether that initiative will continue with other games. It's an important moment for Microsoft; let's see what it's got.Like last year, the Xbox Game Showcase will be followed by a separate, game-specific broadcast, this time forCall of Duty Black Ops 6.See you at 6pm?[4K] Xbox Games Showcase Followed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 DirectWatch on YouTubeOur live coverage of this event has finished.Key points18:20 pmJune 09 2024Gears of War: E-day closes the show18:17 pmJune 09 2024All-digital Xbox Series X coming this autumn18:16 pmJune 09 2024Stalker 2 gets 5th September release date18:11 pmJune 09 2024Rebellion reveals Atomfall18:04 pmJune 09 2024A fresh look at Indiana Jones17:59 pmJune 09 2024Life is Strange: Double Exposure announced for October17:55 pmJune 09 2024Flight Simulator 2024 releases 19th November17:52 pmJune 09 2024Vibesy teenage game Mixtape announced17:47 pmJune 09 2024Fable coming 202517:39 pmJune 09 2024Perfect Dark announced in gameplay trailer17:35 pmJune 09 2024Age of Mythology remaster coming 4th September17:31 pmJune 09 2024Metal Gear Solid 3 remake shown17:29 pmJune 09 2024WoW The War Within releases 26th August17:25 pmJune 09 2024South of Midnight impresses with debut trailer17:22 pmJune 09 2024Expedition 33 announced17:18 pmJune 09 2024Starfield Shattered Space coming this year17:15 pmJune 09 2024Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases this autumn17:12 pmJune 09 2024State of Decay 3 trailer17:08 pmJune 09 2024Doom: The Dark Ages announced17:05 pmJune 09 2024Black Ops 6 on Game Pass day one17:04 pmJune 09 2024First look at Black Ops 6CoverageComments12:03 pmUTCHello and happy Sunday!

I feel like I’m alone in enjoying first 2.You're not alone!–Robert Purchese16:51 pmUTCchrisdeku says:Will be like the PS one, should be lots of third party games. Isn’t Dragon Age getting revealed soon? Does EA have their own show?The Dragon Age trailer is due on Tuesday, 11th, so I doubt we'll see it here.–Robert Purchese16:56 pmUTCThatAnarchistSpacer says:Will the next COD have Margaret Thatcher? She was in the trailer...Indeed I think it does.–Robert Purchese16:56 pmUTCKami says:Oh, and maybe something on World of Warcraft. As long as it isn't more Classic Servers (there's not much left that is considered ""classic"" in WoW terms anyway. Maybe Legion...)Oh! That reminds me: Blizzard was being very cryptic about WoW on console recently. Maybe this is finally the moment it happens.–Robert Purchese17:00 pmUTCOur Chris Tapsell is in the audience for Eurogamer. He says he's sitting behind Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot. If you squint I think you can make out the back of his head. |Image credit:Eurogamer–Robert Purchese17:00 pmUTCSeems like Chris is quite near the front. I hope we see him in the audience reaction shots. He'd better not be whooping and hollering.–Robert Purchese17:04 pmUTCFirst look at Black Ops 6Something's happening! We're off!We're going to see some mature trailers apparently. I'll be the judge of that. Saddam Hussein: check. This must be Black Ops 6.1991. The Berlin Wall has come down. We're getting a montage of Gulf War, um, action. There's George Bush. There's Bill Clinton. The Prodigy's Firestarter is playing and my god, that's still a banger.There's a bit of a spy vibe this time, as we infiltrate large buildings and people swan around in tuxedos. But of course there are guns - lots of guns - too. Requisite helicopter mission with minigun.Come on, where's Thatcher?Motorbikes: check.But no Thatcher. We get Phil Spencer instead.–Robert Purchese17:05 pmUTCBlack Ops 6 on Game Pass day onePhil Spencer is committing to Call of Duty going live on all platforms at the same time. Black Ops 6 will be the first Call of Duty game available on Game Pass day one. Nice.–Robert Purchese17:07 pmUTCLively start. We're now getting another premiere, one Spencer is pumped about. Bethesd Studios. Starfield?No not Starfield. This is something fantastical. Heretic?!–Robert Purchese17:08 pmUTCDoom: The Dark Ages announcedIt looks like Doom. That's definitely the Doom Slayer. But it's all much more gothic. There's a spinning chainsaw shield. There's a double-barrelled shotgun. There are some huge gothic beasties. There's an exo suit!Doom: The Dark Ages. Coming 2025.Just call it Heretic you cowards!–Robert Purchese17:09 pmUTCUndead Labs now. This must be State of Decay 3!–Robert Purchese17:12 pmUTCState of Decay 3 trailerWe're seeing a CGI trailer that's introducing the characters and setting up the environment. Modified cars, scavengers, zombies, chain fences - all the typical zombie survival stuff. Oh we've transitioned into some gameplay now. It's got a nice clean look, if that really is gameplay - no hud. Can you really have gameplay without a hud? Maybe it's target rendering.I'm not sure I can glean much about the game from this trailer.A car stops on a bridge. Loud foot stomps. Huge zombie. End of trailer.State of Decay 3. No release date.–Robert Purchese17:12 pmUTCDragon Age: The Veilguard!–Robert Purchese17:15 pmUTCDragon Age: The Veilguard releases this autumnWe're being introduced to the characters. Harding the scout. Neve the detective. Lucanis the mage killer. Belara the veil jumper. Emmrich the necromancer. Davrin the warden. Taash the dragon hunter. Nice trailer giving a great overview of the game. It's CGI but it looks very lively.Dragon Age comes out this autumn.–Robert Purchese17:18 pmUTCStarfield Shattered Space coming this yearWe're on to Starfield now, it looks like. There's a distinct horror gibe. Purpley pink planets, red-tinged atmospheres. Cults. Hellscapes in space.Starfield Shattered Space coming this year.In addition, there's going to be Starfield update tonight, it seems, bringing new locations, new mods and more.–Robert Purchese17:19 pmUTCThis is all happening at breakneck speed. I'm here for it.We're now onto Fallout 76, which is having a bit of a renaissance moment thanks to the Fallout TV show. It seems like more of a recap on the game rather than an announcement of...""Play as a ghoul from early 2025"" flashes by.And we're onto another world premiere...–Robert Purchese17:22 pmUTCExpedition 33 announcedSandfall Interactive and Kepler. We're hearing about a lady who paints, and we're seeing a CGI trailer about people disappearing.A bit of gameplay mixed in showing multiple characters. It's an RPG it looks like, with combat like Final Fantasy. It's visually very impressive. There's a lot going on on screen. Expedition 33 the game is called.It's coming 2024 to PC and Xbox.–Robert Purchese17:25 pmUTCSouth of Midnight impresses with debut trailerWe're seeing a huge fish in a swamp with a character on their back. They're having a chat in Southern American accents. Just a chat, with a big fish. We're now follwoing the character running through a swampy biome. They've got some grappling hook-looking abilities that whizz them through the environment.They've walked into a boss encounter. The game has a kind of Spider-verse animated look and feel about it - a slight stop-start in how it moves. The monster we're fighting now is a bulging, morphing ball of rage. We defeat it and the area suddenly grows with flowers. Intriguing.Now the character is flying on an air current with some spiritual kind of ability. There's some guitary music accompanying the action. It's very stylish, and the world is crooked and imaginative.A kind of action adventure game then?South of Midnight it's called, coming 2025 to PC and Xbox.–Robert Purchese17:29 pmUTCWoW The War Within releases 26th AugustBlizzard now.It's World of Warcraft. Could it be WoW console? Come on, do it you cowards!We're seeing a montage of all the big villains from WoW. It's a montage of CGI footage from all of the game's main expansions.Come on, come on, what is it, what is it?There's a Galadriel-like voice over talking about the final battle drawing near.It's not just a trailer for the new expansion is it, the War Within? Oh god it is isn't it. This is the start of a trilogy of expansions.Oh I got so excited for a moment there. Stand down, stand down.Release date 26th August 2024, for The War Within.–Robert Purchese17:31 pmUTCMetal Gear Solid 3 remake shownSnake! As in, Solid Snake! Or Naked Snake, as the game is calling him. It's the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, and it looks very handsome.Bah, no other juicy details.–Robert Purchese17:32 pmUTCWhizzing onto Sea of Thieves now. Season 13 coming 25th July.–Robert Purchese17:34 pmUTC444 Games and Kepler now. This looks like Flintlock.I love that hatchet the main character has - and seems to be dextrously smashing into people's heads. Ah! They can turn into the talking god creature rat thing and fly through the air. This looks wild. An ""explosive Soulslike"" the trailer calls it, and it looks it.Flintlock: The Siece of Dawn, coming 18th July to PC and Xbox.–Robert Purchese17:35 pmUTCAge of Mythology remaster coming 4th SeptemberAge of Mythology now, I assume. Zeus giving orders, as he's wont to do. One of the gods is causing an earthquake - rude.It is Age of Mythology: Retold, coming 4th September to PC and Xbox.–Robert Purchese17:36 pmUTCLifeis2D (He/Him) says:Good to see Black & White has ret... oh.Haha.–Robert Purchese17:36 pmUTCThatAnarchistSpacer says:IS THIS PERFECT DARKHello!–Robert Purchese17:39 pmUTCPerfect Dark announced in gameplay trailerThis must be Perfect Dark! Crystal Dynamics and The Intiative. We're in a futuristic setting. Joanna Dark leaping around, hiding behind boxes, parkouring, chatting away. If this is gameplay, it's very smart and fluid looking. There's a real dextrous spy feel to how the game plays. We're in a computer base now. Enemies are there. Whoa, she just took someone down with a flurry of kicks. There's sliding, slow-mo shooting, night vision, smoke bombs. It's colourful, it's fast. This looks good.Perfect Dark, no release date.–Robert Purchese17:41 pmUTCXbox's Matt Booty on screen now, giving us an overview of Xbox games. Looks like he's bought himself a new leather jacket for the occasion.Is this the outro?He's moving onto Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred. It's coming this October. We're going to see the opening cinematic for it now. Blizzard does do a good cinematic.–Robert Purchese17:45 pmUTCWe're in a Southern American setting, it looks like, maybe an Amazonion river. Neyrelle! She's muttering to herself, and oh dear, she seems to be slightly possessed. Now she's talking to her mother in a floating stone. The faces of these characters are rendered brilliantly - those skin textures are wonderful. Something horrid is going to happen now isn't it?Is this Mephisto?She's being drained of her life and strung up in a fleshy hellscape now.Oh! Snap back to reality and we're back on the boat. Neyrelle seems OK. Ah, but the person behind her has most certainly been killed - it's quite gruesome. This whole trainer has been quite gruesome; Blizzard, doubling down on grimness.Coming 8th October to PC and Xbox. Hmm - I'm sure it'll come to PlayStation too but maybe they're not saying yet?–Robert Purchese17:45 pmUTCPlayground Games now. This must be Fable!–Robert Purchese17:47 pmUTCFable coming 2025This is all in-game footage apparently. We're seeing Humphry, whose voice I don't recognise but I'm sure they're famous.We're seeing the main character walk around a city. It looks nice. They're in a forest now, in front of a giant toad. It's montaging a bit now. I wonder if we're building to a release date.Humphry reckons he made the hero who we'll play as. We're seeing some magic and some combat. It's hard to grasp how much of this is CGI or not.And as Kami points out, are we limited to one hero now?Coming 2025.–Robert Purchese17:49 pmUTCAnother world premiere now. A heavily stylised look, a shooter, but fast and comic book loud. Cards in it too, that give you some kind of power-ups. 5v5 rule-changing arena shooter.Called Fragpunk, coming 2025.–Robert Purchese17:50 pmUTCAnother premiere now. A storybook looking illustration, with us playing as a dainty little mouse. It seems to be a kind of survival game. We have to chop trees and gather equipment to survive the wilds. It's very cosy. Well, it was until a giant owl turned up.Winter Burrow, coming early 2025 to PC and Xbox.–Robert Purchese17:52 pmUTCVibesy teenage game Mixtape announcedHeadphones, Annapurna, downhill skateboarding. More lower FPS animation. This really looks like Spider-Verse in terms of how it moves and looks. It's a mixture of 3D and 2D. It's a story about being a teenager in an american town in the 1980s, I think. It's got a hell of a soundtrack, it's very vibesy. It's a bit fantastical too - the characters are floating. Artsy, imaginative, musical.Mixtape, it's called. Coming 2025.–Robert Purchese17:52 pmUTCAsobo now. Flight Simulator!–Robert Purchese17:55 pmUTCFlight Simulator 2024 releases 19th NovemberFlight Simulator 2024. It's got commercial flights, in case you want to show EasyJet how to do it. There's an air ambulance now. There's aerial advertising, in case you want to string up ""I love Eurogamer"" in the sky. There's plane chartering. There's agricultural aviation. There's search and rescue. There's helicopter cargo transport. Remote cargo ops. Aerial firefighting. Basically, there's a lot to do in the world now besides flying over your house.It's very pretty looking, as you might expect. Hot air balloons! Sunsets! Storms! Northern Lights!Flight Sim 2024 releases 19th November.–Robert Purchese17:59 pmUTCLife is Strange: Double Exposure announced for OctoberBrief Elder Scrolls Online interlude there. I'd love to get into it properly sometime.Square Enix now. Deck Nine. A lady finds her friend's body in the woods. We're in modern day times. An all new supernatural murder mystery.Ah it's Max from Life is Strange. She shifted into a parallel timeline where her friend is still alive, but it's a bit Final Destination in how her friend keeps nearly dying. But Max can jump timelines to try and save her friend.Life is Strange: Double Exposure coming 29th October.–Robert Purchese18:04 pmUTCA fresh look at Indiana JonesMachineGames now. It's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. A frozen bridge with missing planks. A frozen battleship. First-person, detailed environments. They're trying to solve a puzzle but enemies arrive. It's haphazard in the Indy way, but it's a cut-scene of sorts. Some brilliantly awful German accents: check. Why don't they just get German actors to do it? Probably because they find it offensive?There's a Nazi officer officer doing a bit of a comedy routine in front of Indy here, who's tied up and forced to watch. The atmosphere is right - a bit silly, a bit pantomime. Now the ship is falling off the cliff and we're into an action scene.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming 2024. No release date, then.–Robert Purchese18:06 pmUTCMechs now! This is a ridiculously fast-looking fight we're seeing - they're buzzing around like flies hopped up on Red Bull. Laser beams are criss-crossing the sky, bullets are pelting everywhere. It's like a fireworks display up there. Now we're on the ground with oversized melee weapons, dashing and thrusting, ooh err.This is Mecha Break, coming 2025, with a beta in August. A live service game then?–Robert Purchese18:07 pmUTCA pile of corpses now, a twisted monster on top of them with very long arms. A character pulling a long sword from their back and flipping up to attack it. They have some magical powers. Now we're montaging to see differnt boss enemies. It's an action game, it's Japanese themed. It's nice and twisted.Wuchang Fallen Feathers, coming 2025.–Robert Purchese18:08 pmUTCAh, this looks like Avowed from Obsidian.–Robert Purchese18:09 pmUTCWe're getting a snapshot of the game, which has a lot more purpose and variety than when we last saw it. A lot more exciting. Perhaps Obsidian took notes. Still only ""coming 2024"".–Robert Purchese18:11 pmUTCRebellion reveals AtomfallA world premiere now. Rebellion!An English countryside village, it looks like. World War 2 era it seems. A mech suit! Hitting someone with a cricket bat! Somethin's amiss. A revolver. A bow and arrow. First-person. Some strange cult rituals. Zombies.Atomfall, coming 2025.–Robert Purchese18:11 pmUTCKami says:Fallout x Dad's ArmyHaha! Very good.–Robert Purchese18:13 pmUTCA Japanese samurai-inspired game now. Feminine voice. Concealed blades. Ninja stealth. Oh now we've swapped to a male-sounding viewpoint and character. This one is fully armoured and heavy by comparison. They are team-mates. It's an action game of some kind.""Together, we will bring justice back to the people.""Assassin's Creed: Shadows, coming 15th November.–Robert Purchese18:16 pmUTCStalker 2 gets 5th September release dateThis must be Stalker 2. Chris has been playing this out in LA by the way and wasn't particularly impressed. I don't think he'll mind me saying that.Remember, GSC had to rebuild to make this game - all of the original Stalker team went elsewhere after the studio was effectively closed down. Still, I've got a lot of respect for anything able to be made in Ukraine at the moment, for obvious reasons.It looks like a game, at least - it looks like it's got actual, proper substance.Stalker 2, coming 5th September.–Robert Purchese18:17 pmUTCAll-digital Xbox Series X coming this autumnMicrosoft's Sarah Bond is on now, closing the show, it sounds like.She announces there's going to be a new all-digital Xbox Series X coming this autumn.""And we're hard at work on the next generation,"" she adds.There's one more thing!–Robert Purchese18:18 pmUTCThis is it, the big finish.We're in a ruined front room. Someone's smashed through a wall. Gears of War!–Robert Purchese18:20 pmUTCGears of War: E-day closes the showIt looks like Marcus Phoenix - or is that Dom? - having a fight with a Locust. And he's getting pummelled. He smashes a TV in the Locust's face. He's still not doing very well. Oh but now he's blown the creatur's head off.The earth shakes. A hole to hell opens. He falls, but then a hand pulls him up. Piano music plays in the background, reminscent of those earlier Gears trailers.Gears of War: E-Day it's called.–Robert Purchese18:20 pmUTCKami says:So... prequel?I assume so!–Robert Purchese18:21 pmUTCWell that was more like it wasn't it? That was breathless from the off, and a lot of things to be excited about. I don't think they left any rock unturned there.–Robert Purchese18:23 pmUTCIt almost goes without saying that everything we saw announced today was - I'm prettty sure - also announced as coming to Game Pass.–Robert Purchese18:25 pmUTCthemightyant says:PLENTY of games I want to play many coming to Game Pass. Only slight thing holding it back was a few too many 2025 or no dates and a few too many DLCYeah, it will be interesting to actually pick back through it and see what was dated and what's coming this year. Surprised that some 2024 titles don't have more specific dates yet, but perhaps they're holding something back for Gamescom.–Robert Purchese18:25 pmUTCKami says:Doubt the WoW Expansion is coming to Game Pass thoughHah, yes, that's very true.–Robert Purchese18:30 pmUTCRight, well. We're not going to be covering the Black Ops stream I'm afraid.

I'm gonna guess at least two.Tom Clancy's Ubisoft, you mean?–Robert Purchese18:33 pmUTCA lot to think about after that. Good show, Microsoft, good show.

It will last two.As for what to expect, Keighley has tempered expectations by saying this year's show will focus more on updates to existing games rather than new releases, which isn't terribly exciting. But Capcom will be there to showMonster Hunter Wilds, we'll probably get a look atStar Wars Outlaws, and Remedy's Sam Lake seems to be there so there's a suggestion of something forAlan Wake 2. Five Nights at Freddie's company Blumhouse has got something new to show, Bandai Namco's action game Unknown 9 looks like it's going to be there, and the creator ofGravity Rushand Silent Hill is going to premiere his new game Slitterhead.

And there he is, wearing a trendy jacket-blazer thing.He's referencing people caring about the health of the industry, and for a moment, it looks like he's going to talk about the layoffs. He feints left, and then he does, he mentions the layoffs! He's talking about small teams and how they're having great success. Helldivers 2 is in there, Balatro, Hades 2, Palword.""I look at this list and I get inspired that smaller teams can, and will, break through. It's a reminder to big companies that..."" They have to treat their teams right. ""There are many paths to success. And that's what makes this industry great.""At least he didn't ignore it this time. Though, with the backdrop of how much The Game Awards charges for a few-minute slot tonight, it maybe rings a bit hollow.And now the games.–Robert Purchese21:06 pmUTCLego Horizon Adventures announcedFirst up, it's Lego Horizon. It's a CGI cinematic to open it, but there's Lego Aloy and it looks bright and adorable. She's very chirpy - the game seems very chirpy.

Crave Seasons from Perfect Garbage. Sleep Awake from Eyes Out. Fear the Spotlight from Cozy Game Pals. The Simulation from Playmestudio. Sam Barlow is involved somewhere.There are a lot of games coming out under the label, evidently. It's a bit like a platform, or an anthology? It's not really clear.Ah! Here's Jason Blum, the founder of the company, here to tell us all about it. What a Hollywood smile he's got. They're working on a sequel to Five Nights at Freddie's he says.""Horror, to my great relief, is getting more and more popular... We wanted to take our approach to movies and apply it to games."" They're giving independent creators a platform to make ""the most f-ed things possible"" and put them into games.Louise Blain, the creative lead of Blumhouse Games now. She's telling us there'll be all kinds of horror sub-genres explored under their label. There's psychological stuff, cosmic horror. To be fair, it did look like a very eclectic list.Bless her, she's frozen a bit on stage.–Robert Purchese21:46 pmUTCFear the Spotlight is the first release coming later this year. 90s horror experience. Creepy but with a narrative. First trailer coming at Day of the Devs after the show.–Robert Purchese21:48 pmUTCA brand new Power Ranger game now with a retro feel. OH YES!

There seems to be a strong focus on a more lively story this time around. It looks like the same hero from the first game to me? I'm a bit out of the loop with this one.The game itself looks very similar, but presumably it's widened and deepend, and it looks more charismatic now, more story-led. Hmm, it's hard to tell. It's coming this year. We'll see!–Robert Purchese21:55 pmUTCHorror game Slitterhead formally announcedWell, this one leaked but here's Slitterhead for real. This is from Bokeh Studios. A man walks around a Japanese city and everything seems quite tame until some kind of goo starts infecting people and now they burst open into monsters. It's all gone a bit wild. Giant mantis are attacking a thin feminine character whose hands suddenly mutate into long thin claws. Now, they've manifested some kind of blood spear. Now, some kind of blood chaingun.

 They were the saviour of low budget, veneer movie making for like three years  before economics caught up and they started focusing on shovel ware to forgotten streaming services, sub-student film level, to fund thr occasional enjoyable bit of low budget but we'll made schlock. 

It reeks of a media company trying to find market growth for their stock price, and while I hope we get some good games out of it and some indie publishers find q decent deal in it, I can't help but feel like this will be another wound up, dev forgotten studio story in a few years time.I think those are very valid concerns.–Robert Purchese21:57 pmUTCKiller Bean, there, a wacky Roguelike shooter made by a single developer in LA, apparently. Geoff is keen to show really highlight the indies he's got here, which is fair enough I suppose.22:01 pmUTCHaven and Fury dev announces climbing game CairnFury and Haven developer Game Bakers here now to announce their new game Cairn. It's a survival climber. We're hearing about the inspiration - one of the studio's founder's parents went to K2 but came back with only half of the expedition force. The climbing gameplay will be ""very intense and realistic"". ""It's a face off between you and the mountain.""Again, more of it later at Day of the Devs.But here's a first look. It's a cel-shaded, slightly stylised take on reality, but it's slow, painstaking climbing progress. It looks like you really feel the vertigo, the loneliess, the precariousness, of being on the face of a large rock. But you're not free climbing - you have a rope. You have a tent, too - you have to camp out on the rock face. It's an exploration in solitary climbing, this game, with all the frustration that comes with that.–Robert Purchese22:03 pmUTCStanley Parable creator's Wandershop shownWe're seeing the new game from the Stanley Parable creator now. It's Wandershop, a game about running a fantastical kind of tea shop. It's a bit like a 3D Stardew Valley, to my eyes. But there's something darker going on behind all of this colour, soething subversive, I think. But what, we don't yet know - the trailer ends.Wandershop is coming this year.–Robert Purchese22:06 pmUTCA couple of decent trailers fly by for bigger budget action game Unknown 9, and then a Soulslike-looking game Enotria, but it's a CGI trailer.–Robert Purchese22:07 pmUTCHerrProduk says:""This historical fantasy game looks good, but I have a fever... a fever for more mustaches""That was a cracking moustache - probably literally, given how rigid it looked.–Robert Purchese22:10 pmUTCAmong Us devs announce indie dev fundWonderful look over the shoulder from someone in the audience there.

151,"DF Weekly: Beyond Astro Bot, how can Sony market a PS5 Pro?","Last week, Sony delivered its latest State of Play and while there were a wealth of new games revealed - many of which look promising - one question remains. How is Sony intending to launchPlayStation 5 Proif the only key triple-A exclusive launching in the same time period isAstro Bot? Make no mistake - as you'll see in this week's DF Direct Weekly - we see Team Asobi's next offering as one of the highlights of the year, but it's not quite the juggernaut release that's going to sell consoles.However, maybe we're missing the point here. Going into the PS5 Pro project, Sony would have been well aware that the concept of an enhanced console had been proven - but this time the firm has real data on how many sales it should expect. It's generally accepted that both Xbox One S/Xbox One X and PS4/PS4 Pro had an 80/20 split between base and enhanced consoles. That's a niche then, albeit a fairly substantial one when you're dealing with millions of units, and depending on pricing, I'd expect sales to continue along similar lines.There's a good argument that the PS5 Pro may not have the same appeal as its predecessor, which leaned heavily into the 4K HDR capabilities of then-new screens. However, one might equally argue that a new display would only be on the shopping list for a niche audience anyway. The people who wanted a best-of-the-best PlayStation experience in 2016 will be the same people who want the same thing with PS5 Pro in 2024.DF Direct Weekly #165: State of Play Reaction, Sony PC Strategy, COD Black Ops 6 on Game PassThis week's DF Direct was filmed in IGN's UK studio, after a 'getting to know you' meeting between Gamer Network and IGN.

The listhereshows no new games from the likes ofNaughty Dog, Sucker Punch or Insomniac. Instead, what we got were a range of good third party releases and mainstay franchises including Call of Duty, FIFA, Final Fantasy and Battlefield. Switch some franchises around and I'd expect the same situation this time around for PlayStation 5 Pro.And I keep bringing this up in various Directs, but we've yet to see the pitch from Sony. We'll undoubtedly see major enhancements to the firm's existing first party titles: higher performance, higher perceived resolutions, improved ray tracing effects - and a likely boost for 120fps support in some games (CPU resources permitting). I'd also expect to see a focus on its PSSR upscaling technology, based on machine learning. Assuming the quality level is comparable with Nvidia DLSS or Intel XeSS, developers have an interesting choice ahead of them - in theory, game-makers could run at lower resolutions than the standard PS5 version and still deliver convincingly good 4K presentations. The freed-up GPU power, in combination with the extra performance from the 60 compute units, could then be routed towards the areas where we expect the Pro to excel.I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to see the enhanced PC RT features of Ratchet and Clank and Marvel's Spider-Man re-routed back to consoles. I can well believe thatGran Turismo 7will achieve full 120fps support and an on-track RT mode, while the new hardware opens up a range of possibilities for games likeReturnal- whether the developer opts to enhance performance or quality modes. I'd also be intrigued to see frame generation demonstrations - whether it's achieved via FSR 3 or with Sony's own machine learning silicon. I can't help but think that with the current AI hype, Sony would be keen to position PS5 Pro as well-positioned for whatever features would benefit.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsI'd also imagine that we'll see a big focus on 'ultra boost' mode. This essentially directs the extra GPU power of the PS5 Pro towards legacy PS5 titles. Bearing in mind how common dynamic resolution scaling is this generation, and how many games aren't quite hitting their performance targets, we should be seeing a range of titles looking better and running better than they ever have before.I have to admit, I'm very curious to see how the FSR 3 frame generation implementation in Immortals of Aveum will look, even if Ascendant Studios makes no additional changes to the coding. The fact that Sony is also making it much easier for developers to add PSSR upscaling to legacy games - without having to update the development environment - should also be transformative to a range of older titles that do get Pro upgrades.In theory then, there's plenty of potential for Sony in marketing an enhanced console, if not quite the eye-catching message that PS4 Pro had in its day - a 4K console for a 4K screen. And the key question is the extent to which an enhanced console is needed at all when it seems as if it's still early days in tapping the potential of the hardware we've already got. But maybe PS5 Pro doesn't need a 'killer app' at launch, if a wealth of legacy games and every title going forward will benefit from its extra horsepower.","Last week, Sony delivered its latest State of Play and while there were a wealth of new games revealed - many of which look promising - one question remains.

152,DF Weekly: FSR 3 frame generation comes to consoles - and we've tested it,"Another week, another episode of DF Direct Weekly (hence the name) and this episode was actually split into two recording sessions. Normal filming occured on Friday morning, but at around 3pm, Ascendant Studios in association with Enduring Games,finallyreleased its AMD FSR 3 frame generation upgrade forImmortals of Aveum. Initial testing from myself and John Linneman confirmed that it's in, it's working and it's well worth talking about, so I put together some data and assets and we added a second part to the Direct. And here it is!As a proof of concept for console frame generation, Immortals of Aveum is compelling, but let's first deal with the basic details. Similar to Nvidia DLSS 3 frame-gen, AMD's take works on buffering up an extra frame, on top of the one last rendered, then inserts an interpolated frame between them. In a best case scenario - basically when you're CPU-limited with GPU cycles to spare - you'll double the frame-rate from the host system, so a 60fps game becomes a 120fps game. However, when you're GPU-limited - as is almost certainly the case with Aveum - gains will be lower.The plus points are obvious though. In the case of Immortals of Aveum, which tends to run at between 40fps to 60fps, the experience moves beyond the 60fps limit and into HFR (high frame-rate) territory, making the game more compelling for those with 120Hz displays. However, there are minus points. Interpolated frames - particularly those sandwiched between two very different frames - will lack the fidelity of standard frames. Also, the process of buffering up an extra frame adds latency... and that will be the time taken to generate the extra frame along with the time taken to calculate the interpolated frame.DF Direct Weekly #164: FSR3 Console Frame-Gen Tested! Hellblade 2 Reaction, IGN Buys Gamer NetworkDF Direct Weekly reaches its 164th episode - and at two hours 25 minutes, it may well be the largest episode yet?Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:15News 01: Immortals of Aveum FSR3 frame-gen tested!0:18:16News 02: Hellblade 2 review reaction0:45:34News 03: IGN buys Gamer Network... but what about DF?0:57:44News 04: TopSpin 2K25 impressions1:08:14News 05: Snapdragon X Elite processors launch1:21:37News 06: New Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door details1:30:23News 07: Ark: Survival Ascended features console menu on consoles1:41:12Supporter Q1: Should 'artistic' effects always be optional in games?1:47:21Supporter Q2: Should a frame-rate cap option be added to Ghost of Tsushima?1:52:55Supporter Q3: Future compatibility enhancements are very helpful - so should they be a standard feature in console games?2:01:32Supporter Q4: Is VRR becoming a crutch for console games?2:09:00Supporter Q5: Are full UE5 titles finally becoming common?2:12:35Supporter Q6: Which game should get an RTX Remix treatment?2:17:15Supporter Q7: By 2030, will 8K gaming be 'a thing'?So, the big question is simple, then: how does Immortals of Aveum stack up? We're working on a full breakdown covering all the current-gen consoles (Series S has it!) but our first look was at Xbox Series X, which received the patch ahead of the PlayStation 5 version. As I expected back in the day, Ascendant isn't looking to sustain 60fps with frame-gen but rather to produce a good HFR experience for HDMI 2.1 displays, especially with VRR (variable refresh rate).However, there are some interesting options. First of all, a new toggle has been added that allows users to enable or disable v-sync. This wasn't an option before - it was locked on. There's also the option to enable or disable AMD FSR 3 frame generation. This is good for users because while we don't like screen-tearing that much, tearing at high frame-rates in a 120Hz container does eliminate v-sync judder and can look perceptually smoother. It's also good for Digital Foundry because it means we can take a look at frame-pacing with our capture cards - an area where FSR 3 frame generation struggled immensely when we first looked at it on PC, butdidimprove.And yes, VRR is natively supported out of the box. On the Series X, just enable VRR on the menu, ensure 120Hz is enabled and you're good to go. FSR 3 frame generation works well in producing interpolated frames and produces a noticeably smoother image. It's easy to tell the difference toggling it on and off. It works. In VRR, the experience is fluid and that's important because frame-rates on Series X generally sit around 70fps to 90fps. That's fine for VRR, but will present fluidity issues without.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsAnother thing I found quite intriguing is that even with frame generation off but running at 120Hz, the game pumps out as many frames as possible, meaning that it's possible to run at higher than 60fps. It doesn'thappen so often with the Series X version of the game, but it does with the Series S game, which - bizarrely - outperforms both X and PS5 by quite a margin, albeit with some remarkable visual downgrades and a very, very low internal resolution, pre-FSR upscaling.I did note that the Xbox frame-gen implementation is not perfect. There appear to be intermediate freezing issues when there's a camera cut during cinematics, but while a bit annoying, it does not intrude on gameplay (a quick look at PS5 doesn't see this issue manifest). That said, just generally, Immortals of Aveum has noticeable Unreal Engine traversal stutter. Frame-gen cannot solve this and some might argue that dropping down from an even higher frame-rate makes the stutter even more noticeable.There are HUD issues, too. 2D elements on the screen are rendered at the original frame-rate and are not interpolated. This is a perennial frame-gen issue (DLSS 3 can be affected too) but the issue with Aveum is that these elements are semi-transparent, with 3D elements visible beneath also subject to running at half-rate.A couple of snapshots of frame-rates in Immortals of Aveum on Xbox Series X, running with frame-gen on and off. This represents the two ends of the performance scale. |Image credit:Digital FoundryHowever, the proof of concept is solid. Immortals of Aveum demonstrates that FSR 3 frame generation has value. In challenging like-for-like content, I noted that Xbox Series X frame-rate rose from a 46.68fps average to 80.43fps - a 72.3 percent boost. More generally, frame generation turns a game running inconsistently at between 40fps to 60fps into an HFR experience, and with VRR active, it is compelling. While the interpolated frames are not perfect - sometimes dramatically so - they 'strobe' between two standard rendered frames. If the frame-rate's high enough, it's hard to detect those visual discrepancies.Now, to answer the most obvious question. Will we see 30fps games 'frame-genned' into 60fps games? I don't think that's the best application of the technology, but it might work on much slower-paced titles. Immortals of Aveum represents how it will work best - taking a game already targeting 60fps and amplifying the frame-rate into HFR territory. As the game was a PlayStation Plus monthly giveaway and is out now on Game Pass, I'd recommend giving it a go. I'll be back later in the week with a detailed breakdown on all supported systems, latency analysis and more.","Another week, another episode of DF Direct Weekly (hence the name) and this episode was actually split into two recording sessions. Normal filming occured on Friday morning, but at around 3pm, Ascendant Studios in association with Enduring Games, finally released its AMD FSR 3 frame generation upgrade for Immortals of Aveum . Initial testing from myself and John Linneman confirmed that it's in, it's working and it's well worth talking about, so I put together some data and assets and we added a second part to the Direct.

153,Eurogamer has a new parent company,"Hey everyone. At 5pm yesterday, it was announced that the Gamer Network family of websites - Eurogamer, GamesIndustry.biz,VG247,Rock Paper Shotgunand Dicebreaker - had been acquired by a new owner, IGN Entertainment.This was not unexpected.Gamer Network had been publicly up for sale for a few months, as you may recall, after our previous parent company Reedpop decided to divest the websites it bought alongside EGX.And IGN Entertainment, which alongside its flagship website also runs a bunch of other long-running brands like Humble Bundle, Mashable, Lifehacker and PCMag, had always seemed a possible buyer.Very sadly, what was unexpected were the number of redundancies included as part of that acquisition. During a torrid time for video game industry layoffs generally, Gamer Network now stands among the many other companies affected. Eurogamer's own site staff have not been directly impacted, but it would be impossible to write this post without acknowledging the loss of friends and colleagues within the Gamer Network office and across our sister websites, some of whom I've worked with for over a decade.It is still the earliest of days in this next chapter for Eurogamer, and I'm reminded now more than ever how lucky I am to be part of the team taking this website through its 25th year.I know you're probably keen to hear more on how being part of a different parent company might impact Eurogamer going forward, and if there are important updates to share in the future I'll endeavour to do so as quickly as I can. For now, my hope is we continue to demonstrate that our commitment to the work we do - our tireless news reporting, definitive reviews, entertaining videos, trustworthy guides and insightful features - remains as strong and as independently minded as ever, today and long into the future.Thanks as always for reading.Tom","Hey everyone.

154,DF Weekly: Ghost of Tsushima on PC is another excellent Nixxes port,"When a game arrives for review on the same day it's released to the general public, this does tend to raise a red flag. I mean, if the quality of the game is good, why not tell people ahead of time? And yet that's the situation that faced us on the release ofGhost of Tsushima: Director's Cut - the latest PC port from the masters at Nixxes. The pedigree of the developer has been established, so perhaps we shouldn't have worried, but even Nixxes releases have been rushed in the past. Thankfully, initial impressions of this latest port are positive.This is the first time Nixxes has produced a PC port based on the Sucker Punch engine, but it's clear that the studio has an established framework of features and all of them slot straight into this Tsushima port. That starts with an enviable range of display technology features, including the must-have features of arbitrary frame-rate and ultra-wide support. And it extends to other Nixxes standards, including the ability to choose any and all upscalers available to your particular GPU - DLSS, XeSS, FSR 3 - along with both AMD and Nvidia frame generation. There's an added twist, however. While DLSS frame-gen shipped from day one with the ability to use any spatial upscaler the user wanted (included none at all!), FSR 3 would only work with AMD's own solution. That's not the case with Tsushima though, meaning that owners of RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs can use DLSS upscaling in combination with FSR 3 frame generation.Beyond that, Nixxes typical flair for scalability with their ports continues. Target 30 frames per second with dynamic resolution at 1280x800 at medium settings and the Steam Deck will work just fine. At the other extreme, I used an RTX 4090-equipped PC running fully maxed at 4K with Nvidia DLAA (think DLSS used for anti-aliasing only at native resolution), finding a minimum of 76fps across the first hour of play. And that's without frame generation, which takes us north of 100 frames per second.DF Direct Weekly #163: Ghost of Tsushima PC Tested, Big Changes At Sony, GTA 6 'Delay', Red Dead PC!Ghost of Tsushima's PC port leads this week's edition of DF Direct Weekly, hosted by Rich Leadbetter, John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:56News 01: Ghost of Tsushima PC impressions!0:16:05News 02: Assassin's Creed Shadows announced0:25:33News 03: PlayStation news roundup!0:49:10News 04: GTA 6 to arrive in Autumn 20250:55:22News 05: Red Dead Redemption possibly coming to PC1:02:30News 06: PO'ed remaster released1:12:13News 07: John and Oliver's new TVs!1:28:42Supporter Q1: Will the changes to Xbox strategy reduce console competition?1:36:49Supporter Q2: Does an Xbox-PC hybrid really make sense?1:43:49Supporter Q3: Could Nvidia's rumoured ARM handheld SoC wipe the floor with Nintendo and Valve?1:48:50Supporter Q4: Are there gaming applications for OpenAI's recently revealed AI tech?1:52:40Supporter Q5: What are your most highly anticipated games for the rest of the year in terms of tech?1:56:21Supporter Q6: How do you prefer to set up your PC displays when gaming?1:58:54Supporter Q7: What are your thoughts on producing update videos on games that are delivered in a subpar state?2:04:25Supporter Q8: What's the latest gaming and tech news you've enjoyed?As a mid-way point, I also tested Ghost of Tsushima on what has lovingly been referred to as the DF Frankenstein's Console - a PC using theAMD 4800S desktop kit(an obscure Chinese OEM-only board based on the Xbox Series X CPU) with theRadeon RX 6700, the closest you'll get to a PC equivalent to the PS5's GPU. The result? I could use Intel XeSS upscaling running at a dynamic 1800p at a close-to-locked 60 frames per second on high settings. I chose this as PS5 targets 1800p with its 'frame-rate mode', albeit using checkerboard rendering which is not an option on PC. The 4800S reveals just how little CPU performance the consoles have up against today's mainstream processors, but even so, Ghost of Tsushima isn't CPU-limited here - it's only the taxing cutscenes (locked to 30fps on PS5) and a slightly under-reactive dynamic resolution system that stop us from running locked to 60fps.We'll have more on the PC port of Tsushima soon, but right now, we can share some important information: first of all, there's no indication whatsoever that #StutterStruggle manifests in this game - it's very, very smooth. Secondly, similar to other Nixxes ports, there are scalability advantages over the PlayStation 5 version of the game, but overall, you're looking at a very familiar experience. Beyond the frame-rate and display options PC users enjoy, one of the biggest advantages comes from a notable boost to image quality. With no checkerboarding in sight, more modern upscalers can deliver a cleaner image - with quality moving off the charts when using DLAA in particular.We've not completed visual head-to-heads up against PS5 yet, but right now, we'd contend that similar to other Nixxes efforts, the high visual setting gives ballpark equivalence in terms of graphical features - though there is no single level-of-detail preset that mirrors PS5 - which seems to be similar to high but with foliage draw that's like a mixture of low and medium. Shadow and volumetric quality is where PC can push significantly beyond PS5 standards.

John shares his enthusiasm for Nightdive's latest remaster - PO'ed - a remarkable release if only because we can't make a particularly compelling commercial argument for its existence... but the fact it does exist is entirely down to the passion and the mission of the studio itself, which is somewhat refreshing in light of recent events.Meanwhile, between discussions onGrand Theft Auto 6's release date and the tantalising prospect of an actual PC port for the first Red Dead Redemption, there's some frank discussion about Sony, Microsoft and the state of this console generation - along with the remarkable statistic that around half of PlayStation's monthly users are still using PS4.Supporter Q+A? It's a part of DF Direct Weekly that I love - we cover eight questions this week with topics as diverse as Nvidia's laptop plans, the viability of a hybrid Xbox/PC console, our most anticipated games of 2024 and whether there's actually any good news when everything is looking so grim right now. We get about 50 to 70 questions submitted each week. Some make it into the show, others will make it into our Supporter-only offering, DF InDirect, but I do read them all - it's great to stay in touch with what our audience are happy about, worried about or interested in.

155,Jumping in at the deep end: building a high-spec gaming PC as your first,"I'm in a bit of an odd position when it comes to the idea of building a computer for gaming. Having written about computer hardware for years, I'dliketo think I've got a good handle on what the best components are for the job. However, I've never actually built a PC, despite wanting to for years. After years of using an older HP Envy machine with quite dated components, I decided it was time for a change, and that I wanted a do-it-all gaming PC that would last me as long as this previous option has.A combination of excitement and inexperience meant I ended up going a tad overkill - and that became an eye-opening experience, given it instilled a lot more fear into to me get things right. Building a high-spec rig as your first ever isn't the easiest, given the overarching thought of cost in your mind when building, and how any mistake could be a costly one.Still, I feel I learned a lot along the way, as theory ran up against reality, and I hope you find my chronicle useful - or at least interesting! Scroll along to read the piece from front to back, or use the links below to jump ahead to the build, benchmarks and final learnings.Component selection and justificationThe build process, and my thoughts on the NZXT H9 FlowBenchmarks: Cyberpunk 2077, Returnal, F1 22, Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy, Dirt Rally 2.0, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six SiegeMy thoughts on the build, and lessons for next timePCPartPicker is brilliant for narrowing down component choices and sanity-checking your build.The first thing I quickly learnt after jumping head first into building a PC for the first time was that the website PCPartPicker is your best friend when it comes to choosing your components. Its databases contain a mass of components to pick from, alongside up-to-date prices and a system that helpfully filters out incompatible parts as you make your choices - it's no use considering Intel motherboards if you've opted for an AMD system, for example, or 360mm liquid coolers if your case can only just fit a 240mm.The tool also offers a seriously powerful filter system, which is useful for sorting components by respective markers, such as for RAM timings or transfer rates, or the speed of an SSD. so you can really drill down into finding the exact components you want. For smaller form factor builds, you can even sort GPUs by their total length to make sure things fit.It isn't perfect, though, as there are some physical constraints that not even PCPartPicker has the power to relay to you, such as CPU cooler and RAM clearance, which was an issue I stubbornly faced in my choice of components, but more on that in a moment. Nonetheless, it's a useful tool for picking components out, as well as for budgeting to see how much you've spent, and how much you've got left if you've set yourself a particular price ceiling.It's one big happy (and expensive) family.CategoryComponentJustificationGPUAsus ROG Strix Gaming OC GeForce RTX 4080 16 GBThe 4080 is a powerful card that's suitable for 4K at high frame rates, and this Strix variant has a smattering of classy RGB and is a ridiculously heavy beast.CPUAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3DIt is, quite simply, thebest value gaming CPUmoney can buy.RAM32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL366000MT/s RAM offers a nice performance boost on AM5, and this Corsair kit is reasonably priced.StorageLexar NM790 4TB NVMe SSDAfantastic value gaming SSDwith a lot of speed, and in a big capacity.CaseNZXT H9 Flow (Black)I wanted to try a dual chamber case, and the H9 Flow is a gorgeous-looking option with functional touches.MotherboardNZXT N7 B650E (Black)A nicely specced AM5 motherboard that matches the clean aesthetics of the case.CoolerNoctua NH-D15 (modified)I wanted to get Noctua somewhere in this build, and the NH-D15 comes highly recommended, even if it it needed a small touch to get it to fit.FansNZXT F120 RGB Core (Black)They match the other components, and I wanted a little bit of RGB for my troubles.PSUNZXT C1200 Gold 1200W 80+ Gold1200W provides more than enough power for the current components inside, and provides headroom for later down the line.All in, I wanted this build to come in and around the £2200-£2500 mark, and that's roughly where I set myself when choosing components based on recommended reviews, personal choices and other guidance. I had an idea of the components I wanted to get, and filled in the gaps on recommendations from elsewhere, especially the assortment of Digital Foundry reviews I could lean on.The big glaring thing about this particular configuration is the graphics card, of course. It's there for everyone to see - it's a £1500 4080, when an MSRP 4090 is only ten percent further up the road in terms of cost. Asus were very gracious in sending this particular 4080 config over for a few weeks for a loan while I built and tested this PC and while it's a lovely card with a lot of power, I couldn't justify spending this much on on a 4080. My actual GPU going forwards is an Nvidia RTX 4080 Super Founder's Edition,, because it's an MSRP card, which brings the cost of the build down to the target price - I just haven't benchmarked it as yet.So, that's my component choice, and the fun of PCPartPicker for you - now to explain my tales of woe and manual labour when putting this thing together.Component selection and justificationThe build process, and my thoughts on the NZXT H9 FlowBenchmarks: Cyberpunk 2077, F1 22, Returnal, Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy, Dirt Rally 2.0, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six SiegeWhy I love this new PC build","I'm in a bit of an odd position when it comes to the idea of building a computer for gaming.

157,Corsair announces plan to acquire troubled sim racing brand,"PC component and peripherals business Corsair has announced plans to acquire Endor AG, the parent company of sim racing brand Fanatec. The move comes a month after Fanatec announced a new CEO amidst widespread condemnation from the sim racing community over botched product launches, shipping delays and customer service failings, which have soured the reputation of a company that producesotherwise well-regarded sim racing gear, from wheels and direct drive wheelbases to pedals and other accessories.There's clear logic behind the move, as Corsair doesn't currently have a sim racing brand in their (extremely wide) ecosystem, unlike rivals Logitech who launchedtheir first direct drive wheelbase last yearandTurtle Beach who did the same earlier this year. Corsair is also extremely proficient when it comes to the logistics of actually producing and selling its products worldwide, something that Fanatec has struggled with historically and has come to a head over the past six months.As well as Fanatec having only EU and US stores, leaving UK buyers to face significant import duties and long shipping times, the firm also faced controversy over its policy of charging up-front for orders which may not be fulfilled for months. Black Friday discounts in November 2023 in particular resulted in a huge amount of interest, with the Fanatec website toppling over for much of the day, but many customers of the sale reported not receiving their orders well into 2024 and support queries going unanswered.The recent launch of the ClubSport DD+ wheelbase for PS5 was also not without controversy, with a vital Sony certification not being granted and the launch therefore being delayed significantly. It's possible that this was the final nail in the coffin for the company's independent operation, asCorsair's press releasementions that it will fund the company's ""short-term cash needs"" and ""negotiate a restructuring of Endor's approximately €70 million of debt"" - a not insignificant burden.If the Endor AG acquisition does go ahead, my view is that Corsair's first priority ought to be shoring up the customer service side of the business, answering support messages and offering refunds if necessary to customers that haven't yet received their orders. Beyond this, it's easy to see other opportunities for Corsair to get their money's worth just by increasing production and ensuring broader retail availability for what is already a complete (and generally high-quality) ecosystem of sim racing gear. Hopefully the ""continued product portfolio expansion"" referenced in the Corsair press release comesafterthese two points are covered off.Of course, it is also a little disappointing to see another independent company swallowed up by a giant of the PC space - even this one is one of the more logical acquisitions we've seen as late. Given the continuing consolidation of the PC industry and rising interest in sim racing in particular, it wouldn't be surprising to see similar interest from the likes of Razer, Asus or Dell, for example, at some point in the future.","PC component and peripherals business Corsair has announced plans to acquire Endor AG, the parent company of sim racing brand Fanatec.

158,DF Weekly: New PS5 Pro GPU details emerge - including a 2.35GHz max boost clock,"A new week and a fresh Monday brings with it the hopefully welcome prospect of a new episode of DF Direct Weekly - and this week, the team sit down to discuss topics as diverse asStarfield's planned performance upgrade for Xbox Series X, the latestSwitch 2rumours, more path tracing in Capcom RE Engine titles and some new information on thePlayStation 5 Pro's GPU - such as a max clock speed of 2.35GHz.It's the PS5 Pro graphics details I'm going to concentrate on today because the information casts an interesting new light on the upcoming console - and may deliver clarity on some of the question marks surrounding GPU performance and backwards compatibility with the existing PS5. Leaked specifications, derived from Sony's developer portal, suggest that the PS5 Pro has 30 WGP (Work Group Processors) delivering 33.5 teraflops of performance. This is up against the standard model with 18 WGP offering up an equivalent 10.23 teraflops.On the surface level, that's an extra 227 percent of performance, except that the same Sony documents suggest only an extra 45 percent of actual game throughput. Part of the explanation comes from the RDNA 3 architecture with its dual-issue FP32 support, which doubles the amount of instructions processed, but which does not typically double game performance.DF Direct Weekly #161: Starfield Performance Upgrade, PS5 Pro GPU Info, New Switch 2 ReportsPlease enjoy this video embed of DF Direct Weekly #161 with our compliments.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:41News 01: Bethesda announces big Starfield update0:23:05News 02: AMD sees massive gaming revenue decline0:40:14News 03: New PS5 Pro GPU details!0:58:27News 04: Switch 2 rumour roundup1:07:40News 05: RTX Remix getting DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction1:16:02News 06: Resident Evil titles get path tracing!1:27:14News 07: AMD Strix APUs pack great integrated GPU performance1:35:06Supporter Q1: Could Nintendo games use DLSS 2 to reach 4K output on Switch 2?1:40:23Supporter Q2: What features would you add to Switch 2, if you could pick anything?1:45:25Supporter Q3: Could the potential merging of Xbox and PC development hurt Xbox?1:50:13Supporter Q4: Could developers run a game’s logic at high rates to improve responsiveness, while keeping frame-rate untouched?1:54:19Supporter Q5: Gaming handhelds theoretically seem as fast as a Series S.

We know that the PS5 has 36 compute units (two CUs per WGP), running at a maximum of 2.23GHz. However, 'reverse-engineering' PS5 Pro's 33.5TF figue suggests a 2.18GHz clock from its 60 CUs,lowerthan that of the standard model. Something doesn't quite make sense then, with some suggesting that the new console actually has 56 CUs, with four disabled, which would deliver a higher clock to hit that 33.5TF - and perhaps in the process provide a hardware balance that's a better fit for PS5 game compatibility.Recent details we've seen - a part of Sony's recent developer disclosures - seem to tidy up the discrepancies to a certain degree. The standard PS5 features 18 WGP over two shader engines/four shader arrays in a 5-4-5-4 configuration, while the Pro does indeed feature 30 active WGPs over two shader engines/four shader arrays in an 8-7-8-7 set-up. Both consoles, therefore, feature four deactivated CUs - and this is confirmation of 60 CUs in the new machine.This means that the stated 33.5TF does indeed suggest a slightly lower clock-speed for the GPU in the region of 2.18GHz - which may be the case in general operation, but the new information also reveals that the PlayStation 5 Procanboost higher than its standard counterpart, to a maximum of 2.35GHz (a theoretical maximum of 36.1TF). However, similar to the original PS5, system performance is limited by a power ceiling, so it's rather rare for the GPU to hit that maximum and only certain games will boost that high. Bearing in mind the surfeit of compute power for standard PlayStation 5 games, we must assume that the slight reduction in general clock speed (just under three percent) likely makes no difference, while the'ultra boost' modeshould instead deliver much more graphics throughput for existing titles.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe cache structure of the new GPU changes in some areas. The 4MB of L2 cache per WGP remains the same, while L1 doubles from 128KB to 256KB to accommodate the larger numbers of compute units per shader engine. L0 cache also improves from 16KB to 32KB, which Sony says is to accommodate higher ray tracing performance.Elsewhere, the PlayStation 5 Pro's GPU evolves to include DirectX12 Ultimate features that were omitted from the original console - so, hardware support for variable rate shading is included, along with extra features for hybrid MSAA. The primitive shader features found in RDNA 1 and the vanilla PS5 are augmented with full support for mesh shaders, which should hopefully see more widespread adoption of averyuseful feature. Sony points out how the stricter requirements of this feature up against PC APIs are no longer an issue.Stepping back from the specifics, it's still surprising to me that a 67 percent increase in compute units only translates to around 45 percent of extra performance, but similar to PS4 Pro vs PS4, increased compute does not scale in a linear fashion with increased game performance. Memory bandwidth only scales by around 29 percent from PS5 to Pro, for example. I think we'll need to look at the Pro more holistically, judged by its actual results, and PSSR upscaling could be just as transformative for Sony as it has been for Nvidia DLSS.Image Quality Enhanced: DLSS 3.7 vs XeSS 1.3 vs FSR 2 - ML Upscaling Just Got BetterAlex Battaglia's recent video on the latest versions of Nvidia DLSS and Intel XeSS demonstrate the quality level Sony should be aiming for with its own PSSR.Watch on YouTubeExtra compute power paired with machine learning-based reconstruction have proven to be a potent combination in the PC space and both working in tandem should show a clear and noticeable improvement over the standard console in terms of both image quality and performance. Sony also appears to be offering developers an easier route forward in retrofitting existing PS5 games with PSSR - and I would expect its required inputs to be similar to those used by FSR 2. So, extra resolutionanda more potent reconstruction technique could be game-changing - especially for those 60fps performance modes that the vanilla PS5 is struggling with. The ability to add PSSR to existing games without migrating onto the latest Sony SDK is also going to help immensely in revisting those older titles to add support.There are clearly lessons learned in the Pro's design too: I rather liked the PlayStation 4 Pro in its day, but there were issues and challenges for developers. Too many games simply delivered the same, or slightly tweaked experiences as the vanilla PS4 version - just running at a higher resolution (1440p vs 1080p proved commonplace). Developers I've spoken to were dismayed at having to service a 4x denser resolution with only an extra 512MB of memory, and weren't entirely convinced by Sony's checkerboard rendering tech. PS5 Pro looks like an altogether more solid package: enough compute power to increase resolution if needed, but a superior reconstruction technology that should hopefully be able to deliver convincing 4K results from 1080p inputs.This time around, without a new wave of displays to justify a console upgrade, Sony has it all to prove in pitching the idea of a PlayStation 5 Pro - but I also remember beingimpressed with the results of PS4 Pro's 4.2TF GPUonce I saw the demos in the flesh and I genuinely can't wait to see what this new machine is capable of.","A new week and a fresh Monday brings with it the hopefully welcome prospect of a new episode of DF Direct Weekly - and this week, the team sit down to discuss topics as diverse as Starfield 's planned performance upgrade for Xbox Series X, the latest Switch 2 rumours, more path tracing in Capcom RE Engine titles and some new information on the PlayStation 5 Pro 's GPU - such as a max clock speed of 2.35GHz.

159,DF Weekly: Fallout 4's next-gen upgrade launch could have gone better,"You could call this week's DF Direct an assemblage of patch tests as they arrived thick and fast for a range of titles, in varying degrees of scale. The addition of a 40fps 'favour quality' mode inAvatar: Frontiers of Pandorastrikes an excellent balance between resolution and visual features for Xbox Series X and PS5, whileLords of the Fallen's 1.5 update finally addressed the long-standing '0fps' problem we reported on back in the day. However, by far the highest profile addition is the 'next-gen' update forFallout 4- and it's swiftly unfolding into a bit of a saga.A few weeks back in DF Direct, we outlined some of the existing issues in the PC version that really needed addressing - the ability to scale the game above 60fps and fixing the weapons debris option that crashes literally any RTX graphics card. Neither of those problems are tackled andplenty more issues are coming to light, calling into question what the point is for PC users. Even the much-vaunted ultra-wide support has problems.In the world of consoles, there has been significantly more effort put into modernising Fallout 4 for today's hardware. Prior to last Thursday, the best you could get was the Xbox One X version running under back-compat for Series X, along with an FPS Boost 60fps variant that did indeed run at a higher frame-rate, but busted visual quality down to Xbox One S level. Not good. Meanwhile, a '720p60' mod that allowed for 4K60 on Series X appeared to have vanished. So, how do things fare with the new patch?DF Direct Weekly #160: Fallout 4 Upgrade Issues, Avatar 40fps Tested, Paper Mario Switch PreviewIt's DF Direct Weekly!

Patch notes describe a 4K 60fps performance mode, a 4K 30fps/40fps quality alternative (depending on whether you are running on a 60Hz or 120Hz display) and a 1440p ultra settings variant. This seems to have been delivered for PS5, but there are problems with Xbox Series X. The performance/quality mode toggle does not work. The evidence suggests that Series X is locked to performance mode only. Disabling this on Series X doesn't seem to change anything - and visuals are notably cut back not only up against PlayStation 5's quality mode, but also against the Xbox One X 4K 30fps back-compat variant you could play last week.This looked like a cut-and-dried bug we reported to Bethesda last week as soon as we noticed it, only forthis tweetto emerge from the publisher on Sunday, suggesting that everything was fine - quality mode worked, apparently, and it ran at 60fps too, seemingly targeting dynamic resolution scaling to maintain performance. Perhaps we were mistaken? We're only human. We get things wrong, just like anyone else. However, fresh captures told the same story - we're still seeing no difference between performance and quality modes, and in the rare instances where frame-rate does drop on Series X, even this happens identically between the two modes.Hopefully this will be resolved soon - assuming we're right here and there's not something wrong with our console - but in the meantime, there's certainly a lot more work to do on our coverage, due later this week.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsBeyond that, there's plenty more to enjoy in this mammoth edition of DF Direct Weekly. Alex returns to the well of red-hot information that is the latest release of GDC and GTC tech presentations, detailing the latest innovations in the world of path-traced rendering. I spent some time checking out frame generation on the Asus ROG Ally with the release of AMD's Fluid Motion Frames driver update, with mixed feelings about the results, while Tom Morgan directly tackles thePaper Mario30fps situation. Has Nintendo really remade a 60fps GameCube game as a 30fps Switch release, and if so, why?Meanwhile, Supporter Q+A continues to deliver! Whatever happened to Xbox's shader feedback sampling? Could frame-gen deliver more than one interpolated frame? What's going on with unstable Core i9 13900K and 14900K processors? That latter point has been a genuine issue for me as my 13900K-based system continually crashes in Adobe Premiere unless I cap power draw. And finally, what would an actual real-life Republic of Gamers look like from a political standpoint?!At this point it would be remiss of me not to point out that our brilliantSupporter Programdelivers early access to every Direct and other content, news updates about what we're up to every week, and also hosts our excellent community where staff members interact daily with backers - the relationship with our audience has only been a good thing.

160,DF Weekly: 'Bespoke Collection' merch hits the DF Store,"Last week, I took to Eurogamer toannounce a Warehouse Salefor Digital Foundry merchandise, and this week we have development: new 'Bespoke' merch has hitthe DF Store, featuring a fan-made design that really tickled us given our collective predilection for uttering this phrase.As well as the long-rumoured Bespoke tee, which comes in a double-sided blue/purple gradient design on a black shirt, you can also pick up a nifty metal pin (pictured above). Finally, the Bespoke Collection also includes a sticker pack, with a DF Approved seal of quality, a DF Retro PVM design and two #stutterstruggle frame-time graphs - including one blank design to chart your very own traversal or shader compilation stutters.We've been working on these designs for the past three months or so - and significantly longer in the case of the PVM design - so it's great to finally see them go on (virtual) store shelves. I think they've turned out wonderfully, having had the chance to test out some of the early samples, and I'm particularly happy that the excellent Bespoke design by community member Dacvak now has the chance to be appreciated by a wider audience.See the new Bespoke Collection at the DF StoreDF Direct Weekly #159: PS5 Pro Ultra Boost Mode, Ghost of Tsushima PC Specs, Kingdom Come 2Digital Foundry Direct Weekly #159 is embedded above, featuring the vocal/facial talents of Rich, Alex and Oliver.Watch on YouTubeAs well as hawking our new wares, which doesn't come particularly naturally to the Digital Foundry crew, I wanted to briefly discusswhywe spend time on merchandise in the first place. After all, surely every minute we spend approving designs, choosing products or tweeting selfies detracts from our actual work, right? Why go through the hassle?In short, the unfortunate reality of making YouTube videos and writing articles in 2024 is that ad revenue alone just isn't enough to keep the lights on. We're lucky enough to have a wonderful community of supporters that supports our work directlyover on Patreon, but that kind of regular contribution isn't for everyone. Selling merch makes sense as a alternative option then, and by buying a shirt or pin, you help us to do the work that we do, while getting a quality item that you (hopefully!) like wearing or looking at.This support is particularly key as we aim to continue toevolve the toolsthat underpin a lot of the work that we do, both on PC and console. We want to keep on the cutting edge of video game and hardware analysis, and that requires investment in new software and techniques. The goal here is to both unlock new avenues of analysis and eliminate some of the heretofore necessary drudgery inherent to our current tools. Ideally, that extra efficiency more than makes up for the (relatively limited) time spent developing and marketing merchandise!0:00:00Introduction0:02:16News 01: PS5 Pro to receive ""ultra boost mode""0:15:50News 02: Ghost of Tsushima PC requirements announced0:31:05News 03: Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 revealed0:38:38News 04: Avatar devs disclose game tech1:00:17News 05: Hands-on with GeForce Now G-Sync1:09:56News 06: Apple opens the emulator floodgates!1:18:45Supporter Q1: What does a more PC-like console look like?

DF Weekly #159 contained a lot of interesting discussions on actual industry news from Rich, Alex and Oliver this week, as the assembled team took on new details about thePlayStation 5 Pro's 'ultra boost mode' and which games might benefit most from the automatic speed-up it entails, oddities amongstGhost of Tsushima's recently released PC requirements and the recent addition of G-Sync to GeForce Now.I was particularly intrigued this week by another topic on the show, which was the reveal ofKingdom Come: Deliverance 2by developers Warhorse Studios. I have spent absolutely hours playing the first title for benchmarking purposes, and I was always struck by both its forward-looking performance characteristics and the scale and scope of its world.It looks like a return to form for the second iteration based onwhat the trailer reveals, with a more modern version of the CryEngine adapation used in the first game rather than the trendier choice of Unreal Engine 5. The games industry largely converging on a single engine has its strengths - and UE5 is certainly a popular choice for a reason - but I'vewritten before about its downsides too, not least of which is a generation of games that share a lot of the same visual flourishes and limitations. It's exciting to see a major new CryEngine title then, and I agree with developer Tobias Stolz-Zwilling that the original title has 'visually aged extremely well' thanks to that CryEngine heritage.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsSo far we've seen some noticeable improvements to the level of detail and graphical fidelity in the new game, with Alex specifically mentioning the rendering of naturalistic environments and the sky rendering with volumetric clouds. Oliver also chimed in on the topic, detailing the improvements to indirect lighting, first-person animation and the potential inclusion of ray-traced reflections visible in semi-gloss armour.It'll be fascinating to see how the game handles its much higher NPC counts too, with the more rural locations in the first game being traded for a pretty sizeable city amongst other environs. We already saw fromBaldur's Gate 3andDragon's Dogma 2that CPU limitations stemming from large NPC numbers can be profound even on high-end PC hardware, so we may be looking at another great test game for CPU reviews - not to mention a challenge for current-gen consoles.This is already a long blog, so I'll just finish off by mentioning that this week's marathon-length show also included some great supporter questions, most relevantly long-time questioner LeftistHominid who asked if Alex would debase his body by wearing an explicitly console version of the DF Motherboard shirt. Our resident PC enthusiast's answer might surprise you, so do check out that question and indeed the full show via the link above.And finally, theDF Store Warehouse Saleis still running for this week only, so it's a good opportunity to grab some older DF designs at a discount - and of course to check out thenew Bespoke Collection itemstoo.

161,DF Weekly: there's a Warehouse Sale on at the DF merch store,"Last week, Rich used the week's DF Direct as a launching point to write abouthow Intel's new benchmarking tools could be transformativefor our testing and coverage of PC games - and this week I'm here to say thatthere's a sale on at the Digital Foundry store.There's a bit of a difference there in terms of scope and import, but I thought I'd take a moment to explain how things are going with the DF Store so far and explain why we're discounting a good portion of our wares. In short, we're hard at work creating new designs, and that means that we'd like to clear out some of our original efforts to reclaim that physical/virtual shelf space for what's to come.With that in mind, we've knocked 30 percent off the price of our originalDigital Foundry Logot-shirts in black and white. These designs won't be retired forever, but it's likely that they'll be out of stock for a little while at least - so if you like the designs, this is a good chance to pick them up at a discount. You'll be happy as Tom (Morgan, pictured above).See everything 30 percent off at the Digital Foundry Store Warehouse SaleDF Direct Weekly #158: Xbox Forward Compatibility, Fallout 4 Upgrade, FSR 3 on ConsolesDigital Foundry Direct Weekly #157 is embedded above - yet another two hour epic, this time kicked off with a call to check out the DF Store Warehouse Sale.Watch on YouTubeI've also selected a few extras to be included in the sale - the now-not-as-seasonalBeanie, which I still wear regularly in the UK's 'spring', and two lovely pieces of artwork: theDF FightersA2 poster and theMotherboardsticker. All three items are also 30 percent off, and make a lovely addition to your head, living space and laptop respectively.We've also cut prices on shipping a few times since the store launched, and we ought now to be quite competitive when it comes to shipping items both domestically (within the UK) and abroad - so do have a look and see what you think!Of course, there's much more going in the world than this sale, and the remaining two hours, one minute and 39 seconds (!) of the show covered diverse topics, including the establishment of the Xbox game preservation team - sparking conversations on the next Xbox consoles, next-genFallout 4upgrades, reactions to theStar Wars Outlawsstory trailer and the veryfirst deployment of FSR 3 for consoles with Immortals of Aveum.0:00:00Introduction and DF Merch0:01:39News 01: Xbox establishes game preservation team0:20:26News 02: Fallout 4 getting current gen upgrade0:30:03News 03: Star Wars Outlaws story trailer drops0:46:10News 04: Dead Space is dead!0:53:56News 05: Immortals of Aveum gets FSR 3 boost on consoles1:08:29Supporter Q1: Can you get console-like convenience on a PC?1:16:12Supporter Q2: Is the PS5 Pro's CPU boost enough to bring a 30fps game to 40fps?1:20:23Supporter Q3: Are modern games too 'fake', with their reliance on upsampling and frame gen?1:26:40Supporter Q4: Could RT be losing traction with upcoming games?1:34:38Supporter Q5: Could Microsoft launch a Series S-matching handheld this holiday season?1:42:06Supporter Q6: What does Microsoft mean when they claim the next Xbox will have the biggest tech leap in a generation?1:52:06Supporter Q7: Should we be happy that more games are targeting 30fps on the consoles?1:57:57Supporter Q8: How powerful will the Switch 2 be relative to the Steam Deck and Series S?TheImmortals of Aveumchat is quite interesting to me, as while the game didn't quite set the world on fire in terms of sales, it's certainly served as an interesting test bed for a whole range of emerging tech - most notably being thefirst AAA game to ship with all of Unreal Engine 5's headline features intactapart from Epic's ownFortnite. This time around, it ought to use the latest branch of FSR 3, which should provide much-needed improvements to AMD's frame generation technology.We noted before that FSR 3 is effective, buttends to stumble in some situations- like delivering evenly paced frames or working with VRR. The forthcoming FSR 3.1 update ought to help some of these issues, but running on consoles presents added issues not found on PC - most notably the fact that consoles typically don't offer many ways to reduce input latency. Latency is the key downside to frame generation at the moment, and Nvidia's implementation on PC relies heavily on integrating its Reflex tech to soften the blow as much as possible. On consoles, there's no equivalent tech, so it'll be fascinating to see how FSR 3 fares - even on a relatively laggy controller-based setup.I was also taken with the gang's answers to some fascinating supporter questions this week, most notably the unified response provided to a supporter that asked if modern games were too 'fake', given their reliance on upsampling and frame generation.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsEchoing the comments of Rich, Alex and Oliver on the Direct, it's tempting and even somewhat reasonable to blame these technologies for the sudden surge in games that have arrived on PS5 and Series X sporting incredibly soft resolve and subpar image quality all-around, but the fact remains that none of the frames in a game are actually real -it's all fakery, as we heard fromCyberpunk 2077developer Jakub Knapik. Basically every graphical technique used in gaming is a way to approximate reality in a way that is good enough, rather than necessarily striving towards an actual ground truth.You can still say that you prefer a game that looks sharper and that's fair enough, but there will always be game developers that are happy to sacrifice 'raw' pixel counts in order to push for more realistic (or stylistic!) looks unlocked by these sorts of technologies. A fixation on 'real' versus 'fake' frames is ultimately a bit reductive, and it can be more helpful to think, as Oliver suggests, about whether you're happy or not with the final frame output and why.Ultimately, frame generation and upsampling are part of a push for performance and optimisation which has existed in video games for decades - especially on consoles, where use of lower-than-native resolutions, especially for effects, has been commonplace. They're tools that allow developers to accomplish their vision of what their game should look like while still hitting a given frame budget, and while it isinterestingto know how the sausage is made, so to speak, you shouldn't let that knowledge harm your enjoyment of the end product.And speaking of the end product, let's bring this full circle and say that you ought to check out theDF Store Warehouse Salewhile that 30 percent discount remains. After all, all of this merch is certified free from fake frames andDigital Foundry approved.","Last week, Rich used the week's DF Direct as a launching point to write about how Intel's new benchmarking tools could be transformative for our testing and coverage of PC games - and this week I'm here to say that there's a sale on at the Digital Foundry store .

162,DF Weekly: re-assessing benchmarking and PC gaming coverage,"Another Monday, another episode of DF Direct Weekly. Myself, John Linneman and Alex Battaglia battle our way through the topics of the week, including initial reactions to theHellblade 2previews from last week - but what I want to talk about here is how Alex spent his time last week. Within this week's Direct, you'll see his tests with Intel's PresentMon 2.0, which may well change the face of PC benchmarking... to a certain degree, at least.PresentMon forms the basis of just about every reputable benchmarking tool out there. Intel pioneered it and adds new features (more about that shortly) but it's used by the likes of CapFrameX, AMD OCAT and even Nvidia FrameView. All of them mix and match various features but it's PresentMon at the core of it, which makes the latest additions interesting. We first caught site of them ina video put together by Gamers Nexusand we've also seen the new features used 'in anger', so to speak, inGN's excellent performance review of Dragon's Dogma 2.First of all, let's talk about PresentMon more holistically. It's a great tool. Essentially it gives accurate frame-time readings for any given benchmark run, it calculates frame-rates and the various percentiles used in most GPU and CPU reviews (bar ours - we still test based on actual frames that emerge from the PC). You also get great metrics on important factors including power consumption, CPU core utilisation and more. Much more. Intel's first major change was to implement what it calls 'CPU Busy' and 'GPU Busy'. Rather than just telling you how long it takes to render and present a frame, we could now see how much of the time was occupied by CPU and GPU in delivering any given frame - invaluable in ascertaining the overall balance of your system.With these two variables, you can aim for 'balance' - which is to say, maximising utilisation of those components to achieve peak performance. Personally, at DF we tend to be more interested in consistency, delivered either via a more rigourous lock to a target frame-rate (eg 60fps or 120fps) or else ensuring that the game is always (or as close to it) GPU-limited. Any given frame tends to present similarly to the one before and after it, meaning consistent frame-times and a perceptually smoother experience, good for VRR monitors. In comparison, being CPU-limited almost always results in egregious stutter.DF Direct Weekly #157: Hellblade 2 Reaction, PS Portal Hack, Ambitious XeSS ImprovementsDigital Foundry Direct Weekly #157 is embedded above - another two hour epic.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:04News 01: Hellblade 2 previews drop!0:26:53News 02: PS Portal hack patched before release0:34:41News 03: 90s FPS PO'ed getting Nightdive remaster0:41:07News 04: C-Smash VRS hits Meta Quest0:52:03News 05: Alex’s PresentMon experiments1:06:57News 06: Campaign demands: stop killing games!1:16:19News 07: Intel updates XeSS with revised modes1:22:04Supporter Q1: Would it be more practical to target 1440p than 4K for performance modes?1:28:11Supporter Q2: Dragon’s Dogma 2 has unimpressive NPC density, so why can’t it hit 60fps on consoles?1:35:17Supporter Q3: Why do some developers implement incorrect 30fps frame-rate caps?1:43:36Supporter Q4: Why isn’t low frame-rate compensation the default with 120Hz and VRR on PS5?1:50:05Supporter Q5: Could the PS5 Pro be powerful enough to run advanced path traced games?1:55:04Supporter Q6: With Microsoft potentially opening Xbox to third parties, was the 3DO approach right all along?2:01:21Supporter Q7: Would it have been better to forgo the PS5 Pro and instead shorten this console generation?Another interesting new data point is 'click to photon' latency, which is essentially the time taken from user input to register on-screen. Nvidia has this function within its own FrameView tool based on 'markers' the developer needs to add to their code (which happens naturally if using DLSS 3 frame-gen). Intel's solution should 'just work'. Latency monitoring is crucial for not just telling you why a game feels poor to control but to put an actual number on it, something that's highly time-consuming to do without internal metrics.So, the case for upgrading our existing frame-capture based benchmarking is strong - we pride ourselves on ensuring that our data is as close to the gameplay experience as possible, meaning that nothing can trump results derived from the output of the GPU, acquired via capture card. However, the sheer wealth of data from PresentMon makes a strong case for using this instead (or indeed merging it with our own tools). On top of that, the recently released PresetMon 2.0 has another new innovation: animation error. This is a form of stutter that may or may not actually present in video output.In this week's Direct, Alex talks about the infamousStar Wars Jedi: Survivor. Even if we get the game running locked to 60 frames per second, motion looks subjectively 'off'. Looking at CPU Busy in relation to GPU Busy shows that while the GPU is running fine, the CPU clearly having issues with consistency. In short, PresentMon is giving us objective data that is explaining the subjectively poor experience. And that's just the beginning - with a more holistic look at all areas of PC performance, further insights may emerge.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsHowever, I'd also argue that the sheer amount of data is potentially overwhelming to the end-user, meaning that using PresentMon's current on-screen visualisations only has a certain amount of utility for the work we do - so perhaps the way forward is to revamp our current graphing tools to present the new data more clearly, and allow us to pick and choose what variables are shown in order to highlight the points we are making.So far, we've been talking about game reviews, but the 'all the data, all the time' aspect of PresentMon working in concert with our real-time graphing set-up means we can visualise whatever data we want, but also do so with multiple inputs (different GPUs for example). Right now, we capture frame-time metrics but that might not be the whole story. An AMD and Nvidia GPU may perform identically, but other aspects like CPU load or power consumption could be very different. A frame-rate graph showing identical performance gives a different impression to one that also includes real-time power consumption metrics that may show one card having a distinct advantage over the other.This is just the beginning of the conversations we're having in Digital Foundry at the moment as we consider transitioning away from a system we've been using (with various upgrades) since 2013. Our current frame capture system integrates with the Eurogamer graphing system to dynamic generate barcharts and frame-time readings based on our captures, but with the data in PresentMon, the sky's the limit in terms of improving component reviews or even offering up product recommendations. It's early doors, but the ambition is there and the core tools are just getting better and better.","Another Monday, another episode of DF Direct Weekly.

163,DF Retro marathon: every PlayStation 1 launch game tested and compared,"Do you find yourself at something of a loose end over the extended holiday weekend? Why not sit back and enjoy our first DF Retro marathon video, which combines multiple episodes of one of our most ambitious DF Retro projects yet into one mega-extended presentation. And it's good stuff, with John Linneman and Audi Sorlie revisiting the epoch-making release of the original Sony PlayStation across 1994 and 1995, examining the history of the system and covering every single launch game across all three major territories: Japan, North America and Europe.As it's Digital Foundry, there are platform comparisons too for every game that also launched on competing consoles - and from my perspective, it's always fascinating to bring DF-level scrutiny to another era, where the variations between games deployed on very different architectures are far more pronounced than today, where most consoles are basically built around very similar PC-style components.Some of you may have seen this 'content' before, and DF Retro tier backers of ourSupporter Programmay have even seen this full two hour, 46 minute presentation in the past - so why bring it back two years later? Well, first of all, we consider it a great way to give a new focus to work that we're immensely proud of, which otherwise languishes in the YouTube backwaters, mostly forgotten. And that's a shame, as this video is as good as the day we made it!DF Retro Marathon: Sony PlayStation/ PSOne - Every Launch Game Tested!A deep dive into every single Sony PlayStation launch title, with platform comparisons where appropriate.Watch on YouTubeSecondly, it's an experiment in attempting to address a different audience. We launchedDF Clipschannel last year, which effectively serves to cut up every episode of DF Direct Weekly into smaller videos that appeal to people that probably aren't that interested in watching three men talk about game technology for two hours each and every week. DF Clips turns every discussion point and supporter question into its own video and I've been surprised and delighted to see how successful it has been, and how much it's grown in just seven months.The marathon concept is a variation on the theme, brought to our attention by our friends and collaborators at the excellentMy Life in Gamingretro channel, who have enjoyed evengreater successby combining their episodes into extended presentations that presumably appeal to people looking for longer form videos. Like so much to do with YouTube and its unfathomable algorithms, we just don't know why the idea works - but we'd like to try to find out, so thanks to Coury Carlson and Marc 'Try4ce' Duddleson for sharing this idea with us.And that got me thinking that the video marathon concept could work for us in other ways too. Remember that time John tested every single console port of Doom ever made? Well, since then, more console Doom conversions have emerged, so another way to 're-surface' that video is to extend it with the latest versions. And what about our analysis of every single Sega/Mega Drive 32X game ever made? Remarkably, there's been some brilliant homebrew developments on the misbegotten peripheral, including a far superior Doom port and even a Tomb Raider proof-of-concept. We'll have a good think about this, but in the meantime, I hope you enjoy the video - we even did a 4K upscale on it to bypass YouTube's miserly 1080p bitrate. Thanks for watching!","Do you find yourself at something of a loose end over the extended holiday weekend? Why not sit back and enjoy our first DF Retro marathon video, which combines multiple episodes of one of our most ambitious DF Retro projects yet into one mega-extended presentation. And it's good stuff, with John Linneman and Audi Sorlie revisiting the epoch-making release of the original Sony PlayStation across 1994 and 1995, examining the history of the system and covering every single launch game across all three major territories: Japan, North America and Europe.

164,DF Weekly: Is GTA 6 at 60fps really out of the question for PS5 Pro?,"Speaking as a journalist, it feels somewhat odd to see things you say become news stories, but it sometimes happens owing to Digital Foundry's profile. So it was last week, when the big takeaway - for many - from ourPS5 Prospecs reaction was our contention thatGrand Theft Auto 6on the new machine would likelynotrun at 60 frames per second. Of course, there are caveats to that particular statement, and we spend some time in DF Direct Weekly #155 discussing it.The whole PS5 Pro/GTA 6 discussion began when the mooted release date for the new Sony machine seemed to position it as the most performant hardware on the market for running Rockstar's next generation blockbuster. Assuming PS5 Pro arrives later on this year, it's an entirely logical supposition, bearing in mind that Rockstar's current release date sees the game arriving in 2025. Rockstar may elect not support PS5 Pro, but the balance of probabilities suggests it will.From there, the question moves onto how the enhanced console is improved over the standard one: what it was designed for, what specifications it has, and how the extra resources may be used in an open-world game like GTA 6. And here's where we can make some fairly confident predictions, because even more so than PS4 Pro and Xbox One X before it, PS5 Pro has what you might describe as a somewhat lop-sided balance between CPU and GPU enhancements.However, before we go any further, there's one gigantic caveat: the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer launched as a 30 frames per second video. All prior GTA console titles going back to the first 3D offering, Grand Theft Auto 3, have targeted 30fps (and often fall short, depending on load). The Red Dead Redemption titles have also run at 30fps on their original host platforms. However, until Rockstar says so, the chance of a 60fps mode in GTA 6 cannot be ruled out.DF Direct Weekly #155: Marvel 1943, Big FSR 3.1 Upgrades, FF7 Rebirth Perf Mode Patch, PSVR2 on PC!DF Direct Weekly #155 is embedded here for your viewing enjoyment.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:44News 01: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra stuns in debut trailer0:18:56News 02: AMD announces FSR 3.10:30:52News 03: Latest PS VR2 update enables PC access0:40:37News 04: Could GTA 6 hit 60 FPS on PS5 Pro?0:57:46News 05: Covert Protocol demo shows off AI characters1:10:17News 06: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth gets new graphics options1:16:05Supporter Q1: What should Microsoft and Sony do to differentiate their next-gen hardware?1:36:44Supporter Q2: Why isn’t Microsoft making more out of their consoles’ machine learning capabilities?1:43:09Supporter Q3: Should Sony invest in frame generation? Does PSSR suggest a lack of faith in AMD’s upscaling tech?1:49:24Supporter Q4: Could backwards compatibility actually hold back Switch 2?Therefore, it stands to reason thatifthe new game does have a 60fps mode on existing consoles, it follows that GTA 6 will also have it on PS5 Pro - and it may deliver a more stable 60fps, by virtue of both its faster CPU and GPU. However, and this is the point we are making, if the consoles are running at 30fps, as seen in the trailer, the chances of the game having a 60fps mode on PS5 Pro are remote.Dense open-world titles require a lot of GPU power to render them, but crucially, they also require a good degree of CPU throughput. The task of the CPU is to simulate the entire world and everything in it. The CPU runs the AI for all of the NPCs and the animation of those characters. In-game physics are also taken care of by the CPU. Based on what we know of the capabilities of the consoles as well as the simulation on display in the trailer, it's hard to believe that there's CPU headroom available to double performance. Remember: PS5 Pro's CPU clocks are just 10 percent higher than the standard model's.We're not ruling out that some base PS5 games may run at 30fps while Pro runs at 60fps, but this would require the title in question to be heavily limited by the GPU alone, not the CPU. Game makers typically look to exploit both CPU and GPU, and with PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, we saw what happened when 'performance' modes were added that simply unlocked the frame-rate: GPU throughput was there to add to the frame-rate, but all it did was to take you into a 40fps no man's land as the game rapidly encountered harsh CPU limits.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsHowever, caveats apart, assuming 60 frames per second is off the table, what should we expect from the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game? This all depends on the extent to which Rockstar uses its features, of course. From the CPU perspective, an extra 10 percent of performance may mean that simulation-based bottlenecks under GTA 6's target frame-rate will be less keenly felt that they would be on the base PS5.In our reaction video to the initial trailer, we noted strong evidence of global illumination based on ray tracing. Rockstar could tap into the much stronger RT performance in PS5 Pro and either increase precision, add extra features or even both. Extra GPU horsepower is available, with Sony noting a basic 45 percent improvement in performance - meaning higher rendering resolution, a stronger lock to target frame-rate, or improvement in quality to any graphics features Rockstar cares to target.However, we would hope to see the developer targeting PSSR - Sony's take on machine learning based upscaling, its answer to Nvidia's excellent DLSS. This would provide much better image quality boosts compared to software-based upscaling used on the base PlayStation 5 and could conceivably even run at lower resolutions than the standard machine and still present in a more detailed manner. From there, the GPU performance could be used to enhance pixelqualityrather than pixelquantity.Grand Theft Auto 5's Ray Traced Reflections Upgrade Tested on PS5 and Xbox Series XGTA 5's upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X is interesting - but ultimately we're looking at current-gen enhancements to a game first designed for Xbox 360 and PS3. Just because GTA 5 has a 60fps performance mode, there are no guarantees that GTA 6 will.Watch on YouTubeWith all of this in mind, the takeaways are fairly straightforward then: at the very least, PS5 Pro will do what PS4 Pro did - improve image quality via improved resolutions and potentially offer a closer lock to the target frame-rate. If the game does not hit a native 4K, the machine learning silicon should at least give a very close representation of how a full 3840x2160 resolution should present, assuming Rockstar uses it. And if the standard PS5 features RT support, the fundamental building blocks required for it (such as BVH structures to trace against) can be repurposed for more or better RT effects.However, assuming that the game is targeting 30fps, the extra performance simply isn't there to run the game's simulation systems at twice the speed to hit 60fps - which calls into question who this machine is targeted at and the expectations of that audience. PS5 Pro can take existing PS5 games running at 60fps and make them look much better - and this will address one of the fundamental concerns we've had with current-gen console games: performance modes with really dodgy image quality. Frame generation techniques could even be used to make those 60fps modes present nicely on 120Hz displays (sorry, but 30fps to 60fps is unlikely, owing to latency and artefacting challenges).However, I'm not sure PS5 Pro has the specs to dissuade users looking to buy another console instead of a more powerful PC. In a world where a Ryzen 7 5800X3D offers over double the performance of a console CPU for under £270/$280 and when even a more budget-minded Core i5 12400F or Ryzen 5 7600 are a lot faster, there are cost-effective ways to get that CPU boost that Sony is unwilling or unable to deliver. Ultimately, it's going to be down to Sony to make the case for PS5 Pro when it chooses to do so and we'll go from there.Going back to the original point though, assuming there are no delays, PlayStation 5 Pro will indeed be the most powerful hardware out there to run GTA 6 - and I'd hope Rockstar will make use of its capabilities. And while a PC may be more powerful, that won't help in a world where we have no ideawhenRockstar may release a PC port.","Speaking as a journalist, it feels somewhat odd to see things you say become news stories, but it sometimes happens owing to Digital Foundry's profile.

165,DF Weekly: new shirt designs and a returning favourite hit the DF Store,"You may remember thatwe relaunchedtheDigital Foundry merch storefor Black Friday last year, with a host of DF-adjacent designs for shirts, mugs, hoodies, posters and stickers. Today, we're happy to announce our first wave of new designs for 2024 - expertly modelled by Rich and Alex in this week's DF Direct show - plus the return of a fan favourite.Our two new designs are right there in the header image for this blog - we have theDF Approvedshirt on the left, in white, and theMotherboardshirt on the right, in grey. Both shirts are screen printed on 100 percent cotton Gildan softstyle midweight shirts, and they're super comfortable to wear. The DF Approved design certifies that you, the wearer of this t-shirt, are a cool and fashionable person, while the Motherboard design is a beautifully detailed take on a circuit board, complete with bespoke and full-fat embellishments of a nerdy nature.Meanwhile, the returning design is theDF Fightersshirt in the centre, which features some incredible artwork from community member Rachel Hams, showing each of the members of the team in the style of a retro beat 'em up. After selling out fairly quick the first time around, the DF Fighters is now fully restocked and available in all sizes from S to 3XL. This is a good chance to pick up the shirt - with amatching poster, if you prefer! - while supplies last.DF Direct Weekly #154: Rise of the Ronin PS5 Preview, Stellar Blade, New Nvidia DLSS RevealsDF Direct Weekly remains our weekly show where we talk about the latest gaming and technology news - here's #154.Watch on YouTubeWe've also reduced many shipping prices since the store first launched, so if you buy one shirt, untracked shipping to the UK should cost £3, while tracked shipping is £5. International tracked shipping is also cheaper, eg around $14 to ship to the US and €12 to ship to Germany.As always, these items are a nice way to support Digital Foundry and the work that we do, as well as being useful apparel and/or accessories in their own right - and we greatly appreciate the support. So: please docheck out the DF merch store!Finally, these March additions won't be the only new DF merch items released in 2024 either - we have a packed schedule planned, including some new product categories debuting in April and May which I'm really excited about, but we'll talk about those a little closer to their release!0:00:00Introduction and DF merchandise0:02:26News 01: Rise of the Ronin preview0:11:40News 02: Nvidia announces upcoming game enhancements0:35:55News 03: Intel unveils PresentMon 2.00:51:08News 04: Stellar Blade demo released, quickly pulled0:56:48News 05: Peter Moore questions the future of consoles1:12:11Supporter Q1: Should console platforms let you impose frame-rate caps yourself?1:19:39Supporter Q2: What rendering tech will we see pushed after path tracing?1:27:22Supporter Q3: Should more developers expose debug menus in their games?1:31:43Supporter Q4: What storage tech do you work off of?1:39:38Supporter Q5: What would Digital Foundry have looked like in the 1990s?Meanwhile, while DF Direct started with a little merch promotion, of course there were plenty of other headlines this week that deserved their own air time. The one I found particularly interesting was Oliver's early look atRise of the Ronin, Team Ninja's upcoming PS5 blockbuster. The review embargo for this game hasn't yet expired, but a preview embargo is now up - so we're free to discuss a bit about the game and how it's shaping up.From a technical perspective, there's a clear visual evolution here from the likes of Wo Long Fallen Dynasty, the development team's last outing in 2023. Oliver picked up on the apparent inclusion of a Virtual Shadow Map (VSM) solution, which produces extremely high-resolution shadows with variable penumbra across all three graphics modes. Those modes are performance, graphics and RT, with the RT mode including reflections on smaller bodies of water (think ponds and streams).Both of these upgrades are impressive, especially in outdoor areas, though Oliver noted that interior spaces and cities are somewhat less impressive by comparison, with a relatively naive solution for indirect lighting and ambient occlusion that doesn't measure up to the best examples we've seen on PS5. There are also some image quality concerns, including what looks like a checkerboard setup for resolution and some image breakup evident, but we'll have to wait for the full review embargo to show this in more detail.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsOverall though, it's a reasonable-looking game that eclipses anything Team Ninja have produced so far and is fun to play, even though it's not a graphical masterclass and performance isn't quite up to snuff in some areas. Tom is on the review for this one, so stay tuned for that as and when!Otherwise, the rest of the show includes discussion of upcoming Nvidia enhancements to a raft of games (think various flavours of RT and DLSS), fundamentally intriguing upgrades to Intel's open source PresentMon performance analysis tools, the accidental release of theStellar Bladedemo for PS5 and much more.We also received some great supporter questions this week, including the mooting of console-level frame-rate capping, a la the Steam Deck and RTSS on PC, fallout from the Spider-Man debug menu and insight into our own PC storage solutions - plus, what would Digital Foundry look like if it started in the 90s?We're almost always blessed with an abundance of fascinating questions, and if you'd like to ask some of your own to be answered on DF Direct orDF InDirect,consider joining us!","You may remember that we relaunched the Digital Foundry merch store for Black Friday last year, with a host of DF-adjacent designs for shirts, mugs, hoodies, posters and stickers.

167,Get a refurbished Xbox Series X or S from Microsoft for less with this wacky CDKeys gift card deal,"This is perhaps one of the wackiest, but most effective deals I've come across in a long time. Using a combination of a Microsoft Store discount code and the current discounted prices on CDKeys for Microsoft gift cards, you can net yourself substantial savings on both of Microsoft's current gen consoles. Arguably the better deal here is on the Xbox Series X for just under £300, netting you a £120 saving on the refurb price, while the Xbox Series S is available for £149, saving you nearly £70 on the £210 list price.Get the Xbox Series X (Certified Refurbished) for £297.26 from Microsoft Store (was £420, with CDKeys gift card and XBOX22XSX code)Get the Xbox Series S (Certified Refurbished) for £148.96 from Microsoft Store (was £210, with CDKeys gift card and XBOX22XSS code)The principle for redeeming both of these discounts is the same - as opposed to paying for the Series X or Series S by means of a card or PayPal, you can load up Microsoft gift cards onto your account to give you a balance equal to the amount of the console's purchase price with the respective discount code, and pay for them that way. If you'd be paying by more normal methods, the Series X would be £328 and the Series S would be £164. However, the way of getting them cheaper is through current discounts from CDKeys on Microsoft gift cards.To break this down further - for the Series X discount, you'd need enough gift cards to have £330 on your Microsoft account balance which works out to:13 lots of £25 cards (worth£22.49each)1 £5 card (worth£4.89)So, that works out to £330, which is enough to pay for the Series X when using codeXBOX22XSXat checkout - but, with the total cost of those discounted gift cards in mind, you're actually paying£297.26.For the Series S, it's the same principle, but obviously less in terms of the quantity of codes:3 lots of £50 cards (worth£44.99each)1 £15 card (worth£13.99)So, that total works out to £165, which is enough to pay for the Series S when using codeXBOX22XSSat checkout using the account balance - but, with the total cost of those discounted gift cards in mind, you're actually paying£148.96.This might seem like a faff for the both of them, but it is worth it considering what you're getting. These may be refurb consoles, but they're Microsoft's own, and come with a full 12 month warranty. Reports I've read of people purchasing these talk about the fact they're virtually in new condition, to provide you with peace of mind.There's also no getting away from the fact that you can get next-gen gaming for £149 with the Series S, which is immense value, while the Series X at £297 is an absolute steal for full-fat 4K/120fps gaming - whichever console you go for, it's for an amazing price.<","This is perhaps one of the wackiest, but most effective deals I've come across in a long time.

168,DF InDirect is a new supporter-only show - and here's a sampler,"TheDigital Foundry Supporter Programhas grown once again with the arrival of a brand-new show exclusive to backers.

The show is available to all backers on all tiers and it's available to watch or listen to right now - and there's a small sample on this page.The idea for InDirect came about owing to the sheer wealth of excellent supporter questions we receive each week. The truth is, we get far too many to answer on the main show (which already tops two hours) while some of the questions require a bit of research before we should respond. That's the case with the sampler below - supporter DaJaCo informed us of discussion surrounding a new upscaling patent lodged by Sony Interactive Entertainment and wanted to know what the idea was and its application in a potentialPlayStation 5 Pro.You can see our response below, but ultimately, therecent announcement from AMDitself that it's looking for machine learning-based upscaling solutions for 'game devices' isn't a particularly good fit for the mechanics of the patent. On top of that, many patents are filed but very few constitute detailed 'tell all' descriptions of actual shipping products. Based on our own thoughts and those of developers we've spoken to familiar with upscaling technology, this looks like an interesting thought experiment - but we'd be surprised to see this actually manifest in PlayStation 5 Pro.Sony Upscaling Patent - Introducing DF InDirectThis sampler for the new DF InDirect show sees Alex, Oliver and Rich offer up their thoughts on what looks to be a Sony upscaling patent. Is the technology viable for PS5 Pro?Watch on YouTubeAnyway, I hope you find the clip insightful - we answer nine more supporter questions in the full 87-minute show covering topics as diverse as resolution vs viewing distance (that old chestnut!), Microsoft's collaboration with Intel, why we don't see more 40fps game modes and the big 1440p vs 4K display debate. And this is just our first show - similar to DF Direct, we've got plans to build and evolve the concept over time, perhaps introducing a livestreaming element for supporters when we film.So, yes, we're finding our way on this one. InDirect may be monthly or bimonthly, for example, but the show itself will always be exclusive to our supporters. The one caveat? Excerpts may filter through toDF Clips, if it's a good fit.It's at this point where I feel compelled to address how important the DF Supporter Program is. In the current environment, YouTube revenue is declining and the idea of being wholly reliant on an algorithm-based platform over which we have zero control has always been daunting for us. We don't do clickbait titles, we don't do sensational thumbnails and sponsorships are few and far between.

169,DF Weekly: a multi-platform future seems inevitable for Microsoft and Sony,"In this week's DF Direct Weekly, the Digital Foundry Team shares their thoughts on the Xbox business update podcast and attempts to fathom strategy from the PlayStation team in the wake of some ominous announcements that resulted in a 10 percentage point dip in Sony's share price. The bottom line looks stark and very straightforward: the audience for PlayStation and Xbox consoles is not increasing gen-on-gen, while the costs of making games to service that audience is increasing dramatically. Something has to change.Let's deal with the Xbox business update first. My take on this is thatPhil Spencerand his team reallywantto take a multi-platform strategy forward, and it's the obvious, logical solution to addressing the problem of the limit in total addressable audience. Not only that, with its ownership of Minecraft and now Activision-Blizzard-King, it'salreadyone of the largest multi-platform publishers in the market. I can well imagine that the likes of Satya Nadella can't quite fathom why Microsoft is limiting its audience in the name of a legacy console model that seemingly isn't working for Xbox any more.However, the pitfalls are obvious. Why buy an Xbox console if you can buy a PlayStation and get access to the next games from both platform holders? This concept of exclusivity as 'specialness' clearly resounds with the console audience, and I would imagine that the Xbox team spent a great deal of time honing its message for the business update because if the rumours were left unchecked, we could have been looking at another PR disaster on the level of the Xbox One debacle from 2013. On a more practical level, Microsoft does need to continue to make its consoles attractive, even in the wake of its 'every screen is an Xbox' messaging. A mechanism to make console sales attractive is required because - in the face of a less than stellar response from Game Pass PC - a home platform is required on which to focus its drive for subscriptions.DF Direct Weekly #150: Xbox Business Update, Sony Financials Reaction - Is The Future Multi-Plat?Reaching its 150th edition, here's the latest Digital Foundry Direct Weekly.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:02:14News 01: Microsoft explains multiplatform strategy0:45:50News 02: Sony: PS5 sales have peaked1:05:22News 03: Rich 'downgrades' from 8K to 4K1:17:15News 04: Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore released1:23:01Supporter Q1: Why don't more games support Dolby Vision and HDR 10+?1:32:41Supporter Q2: Given the limited power of the consoles, should developers reconsider including performance modes?1:41:16Supporter Q3: Given Nvidia's tech lead in GPUs, aren't they an attractive choice for a next-gen console?1:47:00Supporter Q4: Can Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's image quality issues be fixed with a quick patch, or is there a more fundamental limit?1:53:09Supporter Q5: Whatever happened to the Vulkan graphics API?The answer, for now at least? Tentative support for existing, lower profile games to shift over to Nintendo and Sony platforms. Spencer wouldn't name the games, but at this point everyone seems to be aware that we're talking aboutHi-Fi Rush,Sea of Thieves, Pentiment and Grounded. It's a mixture of service games that can only benefit from more players, or under-appreciated gems that could find more of an audience on other systems. It's described as an experiment of sorts, to see how multi-platform could work for Xbox.However, in aninterview with The Verge, Phil Spencer refuses to rule out triple-A juggernauts transitioning to other platforms - and realistically, we should assume that this is a fait accompli. Realistically, ithasto happen for Microsoft to escape its current, limited addressable market. Making the likes of Indiana Jones a timed exclusive on Xbox and PC, then PlayStation support a year later is an obvious idea - but perhaps one that the Xbox team feels is too early to float right now.I have to admit that I remain baffled by the 'every screen is an Xbox' message - does this include screens attached to PlayStations? The idea doesn't work if it's only selected titles, while the obvious workaround - cloud streaming - appears to have failed to gain enough traction. I can't help but feel that Microsoft is eyeing Steam's huge success and wondering how to mirror that, while at the same time still limited by the baggage of legacy console strategy.The Sony financial reports are similarly challenging in terms of the cap on the audience size, but there are further revelations. The biggest headlines refer to the lack of franchise sequels until at least March 2025 and the idea that PlayStation 5 sales have peaked and will decline going forward. We are in the latter stage of its lifecycle, we are told. Prior strategy in previous generations was simple: lower the cost. We have the new, cost-reduced PlayStation 5, but Sony says that this has only balanced prices as the components have become more expensive to procure. The idea of a $299/£299 PlayStation 5 seems unviable. Regular readers of Digital Foundry may remember our Big Xbox Series S interview, where Microsoft explainedwhythis is why they made the junior Xbox in the first place. The cost per transistor in silicon terms is static, while other components seem to have increased in price too.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe solution appears to be a much more aggressive multi-platform strategy, of course! Xbox is highly unlikely to be a part of the picture, but a more focused commitment to PC seems to be the route forward - with theHelldivers 2success only serving to underline how a day and date multi-platform release can drastically alter the scale of success of a particularly hot game. While the story-driven titles may still have a time delay in place between PS5 and PC releases, I would expect that to diminish significantly and perhaps disappear entirely in the fullness of time - though the logistics in terms of delivering those PC versions is onerous.Returning to the Xbox business update, Microsoft seemingly committed to two new pieces of hardware. A handheld seems inevitable at this point, and what we should expect from that in terms of specs rests very much on when Microsoft intends to sell it. I also think that the revised 6nm Xbox Series S and the 'adorably all-digital' Xbox Series X are still likely to land later this year - why would Microsoftnotdeploy a cost-reduced console? However, it's the idea of new hardware that's a bigger generational leap than anything seen before that is obviously the headline grabber.Putting my realist's hat on for a moment, I would be massively surprised to see a leap larger than that of PS1/N64 to PS2/GameCube but a larger generational leap than any seen before in prior Xbox consoles is certainly viable. However, for the same reason that Sony is unable to cost-reduce PlayStation 5 and for the same reason that Xbox Series S exists at all, we need to be realistic about the nature of this technological leap. The Microsoft FTC leak lays out what we should expect in terms of key innovations from its next generation console and it's essentially the Nvidia RTX feature-set as we see it today: AI-driven upscaling and frame generation.If console makers can't brute-force increased performance and capabilities from more transistors alone, it comes via a combination of hardwareandsoftware. If we consider what DLSS 3 is doing, perfectly acceptable results are being delivered by just one pixel out of eight being natively rendered. The question is whether Microsoft partners with AMD or Nvidia to get the job done. Is the S/X console strategy dead? Perhaps, but equally, the way forward may be to reposition the S-level product as the handheld, which would cover two bases. And as for Sony? It'll be interesting to see ifPlayStation 5 Prodoes arrive this year - and how much of the AI tech (if any!) we'll get sooner rather than later.","In this week's DF Direct Weekly, the Digital Foundry Team shares their thoughts on the Xbox business update podcast and attempts to fathom strategy from the PlayStation team in the wake of some ominous announcements that resulted in a 10 percentage point dip in Sony's share price. The bottom line looks stark and very straightforward: the audience for PlayStation and Xbox consoles is not increasing gen-on-gen, while the costs of making games to service that audience is increasing dramatically.

170,DF's tools of the trade: digital callipers,"Digital Foundry's tools of the trade is a new series looking at the tools - physical and virtual - that DF members use to carry out their work analysing video games and hardware. In this first episode, Will Judd shares his thoughts on digital callipers, specifically the Hozo NeoCaliper.There are a handful of tools that should be in any PC gamer's toolkit, from the Phillips-head screwdrivers you'll need to build or modify pretty much every PC out there to the Allen keys that can help you adjust sim racing rigs, monitor arms and other more substantial furniture. However, one useful tool I've not seen mentioned much is a set of callipers - whether that's a traditional analogue set or more newfangled digital alternatives. I've used a set of the latter for several years now, and I'm always amazed at how useful these can be for PC building in general - and PC journalism more specifically.First, the general stuff: callipers are extremely useful for small form factor Mini ITX builds, where youcouldstart by just cramming every component into your case, but it's often better to measure your components before you begin to make sure you'll have enough clearance. Callipers won't replace a tape measure for extremely long objects - I'm thinking of graphics card length, for example - but smaller objects like CPU tower coolers or radiators can be measured quickly and accurately with digital callipers, allowing you to ensure that your intended setup is actually workable in the often limited space available. It's worth pointing out that as well as measuring the size of objects (outer diameter), you can also measure gaps (inner diameter) - the arms on the top of a set of callipers grip in the opposite direction, allowing you to see exactly how much space you have available.Yup, 3.22 metres sounds about right for a house.  |Image credit:HozoI've been experimenting with 3D modelling and 3D printing recently, and callipers are unsurprisingly quite useful here too. If you're trying to recreate a particular object - or create something that seamlessly attaches to something else - then being able to check a range of measurements quickly and accurately is key to avoiding the frustration of printing out something that looks right but turns out to be a few millimetres out of whack (ask me how I know!). The particular set of callipers I'm using at the moment,Hozo's NeoRuler(and itsNeoCaliper attachment), even allow you to set a scale for your measurements, so if you're printing a model that's meant to be 1:40, you can measure individual parts of that model to make sure they're a realistic size!I don't think that either SFF builds or 3D modelling are common enough use cases for digital callipers to be a must-have purchase for nerds everywhere, though they are fairly inexpensive and even occasional use might justify a cheap set. It's as a PC-focused tech journalist that these callipers have more often come in handy from everything from accurately describing the dimensions of objects when reviewing them to making modifications to sim racing gear.For example, it's common for there to be some variation in exactly how manufacturers measure peripherals like mice, where there are a bunch of different points that youcouldmeasure a mouse's width... and therefore while you may see accurate numbers on a product page or press release, it can be impossible to confidently compare mice made by different companies. That's why I tend to eschew those printed numbers and just check for myself, as I know I'm measuring in the same place in different mice - and with a good set of digital callipers, you can run through all of the various measurements - on camera if desired! - within a few seconds. You could do the same with a tape measure, but it takes longer, it's less convenient and there's more ambiguity in the measurement.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsI also find callipers useful when it comes to performing repairs and maintenance. Being able to precisely measure the diameter of a broken fan in a graphics card, or the length of a bolt that you need a few more of, can save a lot of time and grief versus eye-balling it or even using a tape measure. Sizes are relatively standardised in the PC space and you'll likely learn the look of the most common measurements before too long, but it never hurts to confirm that your suspicions are correct!There are quite a few callipers on the market these days, with the cheapest often being digital callipers that run off of a replaceable coin cell battery rather than traditional analogue versions. The Hozo NeoCaliper isa high-end option, but it is also demonstrably more advanced: rechargeable over USB-C and part of a smart ruler set with an integrated LCD display and buttons that allow you to set scales as I mentioned earlier, change between different units on the fly and much more.These are super cool, and they're accurate to a tenth of a millimetre which is impressive. Of course, they also have a lot of other measuring functionality, but if you're a PC gamer rather than a more general hobbyisy or machinist then a set of agood cheap set of digital callipersmight be a better option.I'm curious to hear whether anyone else uses (digital) callipers regularly - and if so, what you use them for! If you don't use them, do you think they'd be useful?

171,DF Weekly: what should expect from Xbox's business update this week?,"In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we spend some quality time withHelldivers 2, get to grips with theFinal Fantasy 7 Rebirthdemo and say a lot of positive things about the upcomingPenny's Big Breakaway- but discussion is dominated by the big Microsoft story. Just what's going on with its multi-platform plans? Why didn't the Xbox team provide immediate clarity and shut down rumours that have clearly spiralled out of control? If a 'business update' is coming this week, does that mean that some or all of the rumours are true?The rumours in question are suggesting that a number of Xbox-exclusive titles are on their way to other platforms. On the face of it, that's nothing new. A number of Xbox properties have transitioned across to rival platforms - including PlayStation. Acquired IPs such as Minecraft and Call of Duty have always been multi-platform and will continue to be. The notion of lower profile games such asHi-Fi Rushor Pentiment moving over to other consoles also shouldn't be that much of a big deal. Indeed, by exposing more users to these games, Microsoft may even gain some converts to its ecosystem - whether it's on console or PC.The bone of contention appears to be its higher profile exclusives, with the likes of Halo and Indiana Jones mentioned - and that's caused a spectacular backlash, particularly amongst the Xbox influencers on Twitter/X who have relationships with Xbox execs. The theory, as I understand it, is this: if the crown jewels of the Xbox experience are available on PlayStation, why would anyone need an Xbox? Buying a PlayStation would offer access to the best of both worlds, negating the need to buy an Xbox in the first place. In turn, this has led to conjecture that Microsoft may even exit the hardware market.DF Direct Weekly #149: Xbox Multi-Plat Meltdown, Helldivers 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Hands-OnDF Direct Weekly #149 is embedded here for your viewing pleasure, with Rich Leadbetter, John Linneman and Alex Battaglia at the mics.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:52News 01: Is Microsoft embracing multiplatform gaming?0:43:52News 02: Hands-on with Helldivers 20:54:41News 03: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth impressions!1:05:03News 04: Penny’s Big Breakaway preview1:11:42Supporter Q1: What’s the minimum advisable frame-rate when using frame gen with a controller?1:17:50Supporter Q2: Is Nvidia purposefully limiting frame gen to the RTX 4000 series to increase sales?1:27:18Supporter Q3: Given that the Series S is the best-selling current-gen Xbox, should we consider it the baseline experience this gen?1:34:14Supporter Q4: Has the use of FSR been good or bad for console gaming?1:43:14Supporter Q5: Why doesn’t AMD often pioneer new graphics techniques like Nvidia?1:51:44Supporter Q6: Can John recommend any 3D Sonic titles?For me, going into the business update due this week, the key questions are simple: what is the vision? What is the strategy? If Xbox is changing, what's it changing into? This gives rise to many more questions: is there a need for Microsoft to diversify its support for other consoles, and if so, why? Could it be that Game Pass is not financially sustainable or that its growth has plateaued? Is Game Pass actually fine and is Microsoft simply looking to increase profits - or to secure as much of an advantage from its mammoth acquisition run as it possibly can?Perhaps the strategy is simply to take another stab at increasing TAM (total addressable audience) in the wake of its cloud strategy failing to be the game-changer Microsoft may have hoped for. The more games there are on as many systems as possible, the better it would be for Microsoft. And then there are the statements coming from Microsoft itself. Though recognising the reality of the market, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is on the record as saying, ""if it were up to me, I would love to get rid of exclusives on consoles"". He's also said, ""we have the ability to really do what we've always set out to do, which is build great games and deliver them to folks across all platforms, right, which is Xbox and consoles, the PCs, and now even including mobile gaming and cloud gaming.""The signs point to a change in strategy - the question is, is it going to be an evolution or a revolution? The meltdown from select Xbox influencers, perhaps briefed by people in the know who aren't happy with the change in direction, does suggest that Microsoft is - or maybe was - set on radical and controversial changes. Porting lower profile games isn't likely to be the game-changing strategy that will transform Xbox's fortunes. However, going bigger and bolder could have consequences on the existing business.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsWhat I'm certain in saying right now based on our own sources is that there is no plan for Microsoft to exit the console market. Tenth generation consoles are in development - and I would like to see a more bold vision from the Xbox team here as delivering much the same hardware as Sony simply hasn't worked for them. How the team looks to make those consoles desirable if key titles are available on the closest competitor's hardware really is going to be a challenge to articulate.I would be intrigued to see Microsoft co-opt existing hardware into its ecosystem, however. We've got an Xbox app on PC, but what we don't have is the kind of tailored experience that defines a console experience. And perhaps that dovetails into Microsoft's anticipated handheld strategy.In our Direct this week, John Linneman talks about the concept of opening up Xbox's Windows-based operating system to work on more PC hardware, which would be challenging bearing in mind the infinite combinations of components out there. I've put more thought into this idea, but perhaps an interesting step forward would be to tie Xbox OS to specific PC hardware in the handheld space. A Ryzen 7 7840U or Z1 Extreme seems to be at the heart of every major Windows handheld right now, and as it seems that Microsoft is especially interested in the mobile space, establishing that as the baseline could deliver some intriguing results - a third Xbox tier, if you will, that sits below Xbox Series S.Similar to the existence of Steam Deck and Valve's stated aim to tailor SteamOS for other AMD-based devices, Microsoft could do the same thing. A flagship Xbox device would be excellent, but co-opting other devices into the mix could be compelling. Developing another Xbox SKU may be onerous for developers, but arguably we're heading in that direction anyway with the success of Steam Deck. It's a strategic move that Microsoft could announce sooner rather than later - unlike its plans for its actual tenth generation console.In truth, simply by committing to a new Xbox, Microsoft kills that particular rumour dead in its tracks - the question is more about the identity of Xbox if profound change is coming. And crucially, if there's a new policy in place on multi-platform releases - particularly on PlayStation - the leadership needs to be clear and unambiguous about it. But more than that, I get the idea that Microsoft is viewing gaming on a macro-scale we may not fully appreciate. If there's a bold and exciting plan in place, I can't wait to hear more about it.","In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we spend some quality time with Helldivers 2 , get to grips with the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo and say a lot of positive things about the upcoming Penny's Big Breakaway - but discussion is dominated by the big Microsoft story.

172,"As esports streams improve, live stage shows are evolving too","We've come a long way from the early days of esports, where video was rare and basic text or audio reports were the only way to follow along with a competition remotely. Now, it's possible to tune in at home and see a show as professional as any on terrestrial TV, with broadcast talent casting, experts explaining plays and comic interstitial segments to fill downtime and fulfil sponsor obligations - all cut with live views of LAN halls or arena stages showing competitors in the throes of sweet victory or torturous, heart-breaking defeat. Yet the advances in remote viewing can actually discourage live attendance - why spend hours or days travelling to an event in person when you can tune in on your phone, PC or TV anywhere in the world?Clearly, the answer isn't to make the online experience worse - it's to evolve the live show by making it meaningfully different. It was this thought that I was struck with while attending the IEM KatowiceCounter-Strike 2tournament in early February, where it was clear that those attending the arena in person were being rewarded with a unique production that went well beyond the the other esports events I've attended in the past from ESL and its rivals.To differentiate that live experience, tournament organiser and production company ESL is cutting away from the stream more frequently to make room for skits, crowd interaction, giveaways and other content. This makes attending the arena more of an experience and differentiates it from simply watching the stream on a large screen with the sound turned up. These are often helmed by broadcast talent, allowing fans in the arena to actually see the casters normally sequestered away in casting booths overlooking the show floor - and perhaps speak with them before and after the segment in impromptu photo and signing sessions, a nice bonus for those with more expensive tickets on the arena floor.The IEM Katowice opening ceremony was the loudest, most chest-rumbling thing I've ever heard. It didn't have to go this hard but I'm so glad it did.pic.twitter.com/BAl6XVhJY0— Will Judd 威廉 (@wsjudd)February 9, 2024To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsNot every interlude is a winner - crowd participants can set the arena alight with their natural charisma or cause an otherwise-promising segment to drag - but with familiar faces often in tow, even sponsor spots from Counter-Strike skin trading sites can be entertaining diversions.Of course, ESL isn't relying on these extras to sell the show - they're also using humungous screens and speakers that produce bone-shaking bass, with in-game bomb detonations represented with the release of smoke or gouts of flame. While many screens do show the stream - while custom segments aren't in progress - there are also bespoke portrait-orientation displays showing player stats, time-out progression and sponsors, plus long LED strips that show the progression of the bomb and defuse timers.It makes for an immersive experience even in an empty arena, but add in the chants and screams of thousands of Polish and international fans cheering their favourite teams and great plays, and you have an experience that goes beyond even live sport and into the realm of theatre.This segment had two Counter-Strike casters asking two members of the audience to guess the combined total value of five Counter-Strike skins. If you're curious, the answer was around $1700, with the nearest guesser winning $500 for their troubles. Other recurring segments included package 'deliveries' to those with the best signs by DHL-uniformed talent and call-and-response drum demonstrations by chicken-hatted fans.  |Image credit:Digital FoundryThat's not to say that stream viewers are missing out either. It's clear that there's a huge appetite for novel ideas when it comes to filling time, with light-hearted interviews and full-on comedic skits sharing screen time with expert recaps of past games and statistical analysis of upcoming matches. These pre-recorded sections serve a vital role, freeing up talent and production crew alike to take breaks between matches instead of filling for time endlessly, and there's no doubt having this kind of bespoke content improves viewing figures versus a loading screen too.Again, not every segment is a banger, but there are fewer duds than when esports productions started dipping their toes in the water with this kind of content half a decade ago - andsome skitsend up being more memorable than the actual matches they bookend.All of this production takes a lot of work to implement. The physical stage is being set up even as the group stages of the tournament are occurring a few weeks earlier, with a suite of dry runs before each live production to ensure displays, cameras, microphones, interfaces, effects and more are all working as they should. (One of my favourite experiences of the tournament was listening to the fake victory speech of a production manager thrust into the role of a team captain, explaining on stage how his imaginary team managed to bounce back from an early defeat to clinch the match to a backdrop of a meme-filled match overlay.) More than 4000 staff are working at IEM Katowice, a staggering figure even given that the headlining Counter-Strike tournament is joined by a smallerStarCrafttournament and a free expo for attendees.Beyond the drama of the Counter-Strike and StarCraft competitions themselves, it's been fascinating to see the machinery of esports production up close and personal - and I'm curious to see whether rival tournament organisers will take a similar approach to their live shows as esports continues to evolve.Disclosure: Acer UK paid for flights to Poland and accommodation in Katowice for the length of the tournament.","We've come a long way from the early days of esports, where video was rare and basic text or audio reports were the only way to follow along with a competition remotely.

174,DF Weekly: Tekken 8 reminds us how important low input lag is to great gaming,"This week's DF Direct Weekly - perhaps inevitably - kicks off with extended discussion on thePalworldphenomenon, while much time is spent mulling over theHorizon Forbidden WestPC features trailer Sony 'dropped' last week. However, what caught my eye in putting this piece together was our discussion on input lag in the wake of John'sTekken 8coverage, where it emerged that Namco had delivered the most responsiveTekkengame in the modern era. We don't focus too much on input lag, but really we should, especially as we enter the next era of graphics technology.Put simply, input lag is usually defined as the time taken between input from the player on his device of choice and that input playing out on-screen. Typically, the longer the delay, the more noticeable it is and the less enjoyable a game can be to play. Basic methodology in measuring it - in basic terms at least - has not changed since 2009,when ex-Neversoft (now UFO debunker) Mick West posted an article where he measured input lag by using a 60fps camera pointed at both joypad and screen. By moving frame by frame, you can see the precise frame where input is made and then you simply count the frames until the result is visible on-screen.Methodology was tightened up with the creation of the controller monitor board, which tied button presses to LEDs on a board you positioned next to your screen, again using a high speed camera to measure the difference between device input and game response. Fast forward to 2017 andremarkable work by Nigel Woodallpushed the science to the next level. By converting HDMI to component video and then disabling two of the three components whenever the button was pressed (producing a small border on-screen for the duration of the press), the high-speed camera was no longer required - you could use video capture instead to get input lag measurements that removed much of the prior ambiguity in camer-based results. Frame counting? That's still required, though Nigel has made some efforts on automation here.DF Direct Weekly #147: Palworld Mania vs Tech Jank, AMD AFMF Tested, Horizon Forbidden West PC!Digital Foundry Direct Weekly reaches its 147th 'Maximum Break' EditionWatch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:54News 01: What’s up with Palworld?0:25:45News 02: Capcom adds Enigma DRM to older games0:35:31News 03: AMD releases Fluid Motion Frames tech0:52:30News 04: Horizon Forbidden West PC features detailed1:05:22News 05: Tekken 8: a superb fighter1:15:53News 06: Input lag deep dive1:32:52Supporter Q1: What would you recommend spec wise for an upper-midrange PC?1:37:08Supporter Q2: Should id Software commercialize their id Tech engine?1:40:12Supporter Q3: Is the time of 1080p monitors over?1:43:55Supporter Q4: Could Nintendo, Microsoft, or Sony develop their own Proton-like translation layers to run games from other platforms?1:46:55Supporter Q5: With John’s new Direct background, isn’t he worried about burn-in?Ultimately though, what we're seeing is improved methodology to get a tighter lock on an important part of the gameplay experience - especially for competitive titles. There are big implications for PC graphics card reviews as well. Nvidia and AMD are working hard on technologies like Reflex and AntiLag to reduce input lag. Typically input lag reduces as frame-rates go higher - but we're now looking at scenarios where the more performant graphics card could possibly deliver slower-to-respond gameplay. Methodology here is somewhat simpler thanks to PC's open approach: tools are available that can measure what Nvidia calls 'PC latency' as part of the benchmarking procedure.The importance of input lag comes into even sharper focus as we move into the era of frame generation as the means by which to improve frame-rates, freeing up the GPU for next-level rendering - like path-tracing, for example. Current forms of frame-gen keep a frame in hand and have a processing cost of their own, two things that impact response. It's widely accepted that the end-game of frame-gen is that interpolated frames will match the refresh rate of your display. However, right now at least, it's a trade between game fluidity and response, so keeping input lag in check is vitally important - as is measuring it as part of a critique on game performance.Nvidia's 'PC latency' is useful as its prior methodology -LDAT- was in need of revision. In theory, LDAT should answer the question of how to measure input lag once and for all, by using a sensor attached to the display that measures a sudden change in luminance after a mouse button press, like the muzzle flash of a game in an FPS, for example.I used this to measure display latency improvements in Steam Deck OLEDbut it has one big limitation - if you're not playing an FPS, finding an area of the screen to measure is immensely tricky. For that reason, we only use LDAT sparingly - and indeed, for a current piece we're working on concerning cloud lag on the new PlayStation streaming service, we've reverted to the OG Mick West approach.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsOne way or another, internal metrics like 'PC latency' will solve this issue for PC games, but the path to getting good numbers of consoles remains tricky. It's likely the case that frame-counting will always be a part of the process, which is onerous, but is at least easier than pixel-counting (though it does require a somewhat convoluted hardware system). However, as we discuss in this week's Direct, there is the sense that the controller itself desensitises general gameplay, opening up a wider window of what feels like 'acceptable' response to many people.If we go back to Tom Morgan's work back in 2017 based on Nigel Woodall's component interrupt method, we can see that there's a gulf in response between games running at 30fps and those running at 60fps. So far, so logical. However, his testing primarily looked at 60fps games and it's remarkable to see a substantial divide in response time between games operating at the same frame-rate - a remarkable 47.5ms delta between Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (39.3ms) and Doom 2016 (86.8ms). And yet nobody had too many complaints at the time about Doom's response.This is just my personal theory, but I believe that the nature of the joypad itself dulls perception of fast response for many people and at the same time, even if Doom is laggier, if it's consistently operating at the same level of response, people adjust to it quite quickly. It takes a game with truly poor response, or highly variable response -Killzone 2on PS3, for example - for people to really start to cotton on that there's something not quite right. The controller introduces other issues of course, which may feel like input lag problems but are something quite different - the dead zone areas on analogue sticks for example.Input Lag Tested! Call of Duty vs Battlefield! Overwatch, Halo 5 And More!This DF video from 2017 looks at first-person shooter latency in console games, using the Nigel Woodall video interrupt technique. It's still valid today - but isn't compatible with VRR.Watch on YouTubeGenerally speaking, a faster-to-respond game feels better to play, but for console titles at least, our current thinking is that it's a case of doing the work when it 'feels' like something's wrong - there's seemingly a wide spread of seemingly acceptable input lag values and the response rates we get are often determined by aspects such as more complex game engines or double vs triple v-sync buffering. In the PC space though, it's one of my missions for 2024 to more heavily integrate latency analysis into general testing - especially on graphics cards and as frame generation gains more traction.In the meantime, enjoy Tekken 8 and if you are playing it, I'm curious if you notice the difference delivered by a crisper response - it's almost 20ms quicker to respond than Tekken 7! I'd also recommendfollowing Nigel Woodalland checking out hisinput lag database, which throws up a range of interesting results.I also hope you enjoy this week's DF Direct, which also includes some testing on AMD's Fluid Motion Frames driver, which brings frame generation to every DX11 or DX12 game out there (with certain caveats!).

175,DF Direct Weekly: Xbox's Developer Direct is the perfect vehicle for a big game reveal,"It's been just over a year now since Microsoft delivered its first Developer Direct - and back in the day I called it the ""best games show we've seen in years"". After its latest episode, I stand by those words and more than that, I also believe it's the perfect way to debut a big new game. I don't think they get much bigger with the hugely promisingIndiana Jones and the Great Circle.This new Developer Direct is the main point of discussion in this week's DF Direct (no underscore) Weekly, where myself, John Linneman and Alex Battaglia share our first thoughts on each of the key titles shown in the show - but the key point is that the formula for the Microsoft show fundamentally addresses a key concern we've had with platform holder event coverage and the 'trailerfication' of games. The truth is, it takes a lot of time, money and effort to make a game - so to boil the experience down into a sub-two minute slice of action, often with no context whatsoever, means a game has to work incredibly hard to command attention.DF Direct Weekly #146: Indiana Jones, Hellblade 2...

More than that, while the lines are obviously highly scripted and well-rehersed, the point is that it's the developers telling us about what they're working on. There's a compelling level of authenticity in factoring out the marketing execs and the 'suits' and letting the creators of the games tell us about what they're up to.As for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it's great to see Machine Games at work on a project of this magnitude - and this studio definitely qualified for the task. Key Starbreeze staff members still work at Machine, and it's great to see DNA from the Riddick games and The Darkness present in the new Indy game. That starts with the first-person perspective, giving way to third-person for cutscenes and traversal -justlike Riddick.Engine technology is confirmed as idTech - the engine Machine Games has used extensively in its prior Wolfenstein titles - meaning that Indiana Jones should be shipping on Xbox consoles running at 60 frames per second, while the pedigree of the tech should ensure a high quality, stutter-free PC experience. Everything seems to be aligning perfectly on this one and at Digital Foundry, we're very excited about this one.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsBeyond Developer Direct and the other titles discussed in the Microsoft showcase, we spend some time discussing the decision not to releaseHellblade 2as a physical media product. This, in combination with the Microsoft FTC's leak about an 'adorably all-digital' Xbox Series X suggest some momentum towards the discontinuation of Xbox discs. Perhaps it's what the audience wants at this point and to be honest, shipping discs that sometimes have no code on them isn't exactly ideal. Either way, we're concerned about this on several fronts: in terms of the preservation of games, not to mention the user's right to actually buy a piece of software and own it, share it or sell it.Meanwhile, we also discuss the negative reactions to The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's release - and its uncannily similarities to the existing PS4 Pro version, and we also field a range of questions from our supporters about the RTX 40-series 'Super' refresh, which kicked off with the nicely pitched RTX 4070 Super. There's also some reaction to our content on modded PS5s unlocking the frame-rate caps on a bunch of key PlayStation 4 titles, and the extent to which some of these mods could get some form of official release for everyone.DF Direct Weekly is a highlight of my week, and I hope you enjoy it too - and if you do, please do consider theDigital Foundry Supporter Program.

177,"Nvidia announces RTX 4080 Super, 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super graphics cards","Nvidia announced its latest slew of RTX graphics cards in a press conference today to kick off CES 2024, with the RTX 40-series being extended with three new 'Super' variants: the $999/£959 RTX 4080 Super, the $799/£769 RTX 4070 Ti Super and the $599/£579 RTX 4070 Super. We'd already discussed these cards on this week's DF Direct following comprehensive leaks, but the official announcement includes some fascinating extra details - and the combination of spec bumps plus price cuts in some cases could result in high-end GPUs becoming more affordable.These new Super cards are set to be released throughout January at one week intervals, with RTX 4070 Super cards on shelves on the 17th, followed by 4070 Ti Supers on the 24th and 4080 Supers on the 31st - an intriguing strategy that may shore up availability. The 4080S and 4070S are set to be available in Nvidia Founders Editions in addition to the usual third-party options, while the 4070 Ti Super goes without a first-party FE model. Note that the 4080 Super and 4070 Ti Super cardsreplacetheir non-Super counterparts, while the 4070 remains available at $549, creating a seven-card stack from the RTX 4060 to the RTX 4090.Looking at the confirmed specs of each card versus their same-tier predecessors, there are a few surprises alongside the expected bumps. For example, the RTX 4070 Ti Super gets the AD103 GPU previously reserved for the RTX 4080, with a healthy 10 percent increase in CUDA cores - plus a full 16GB of GDDR6X memory with a 256-bit bus, versus 12GB and a 192-bit bus on the original 4070 Ti. Boost clocks and rated power draw remain the same though, so we'd expect a relatively moderate performance increase here.DF Direct Weekly #144: 2024 Games/Consoles/Hardware Preview, MSI Claw Reveal, RTX 40 Series SuperHere's the full (nearly two-hour!)

It'll be interesting to see how this performs versus the original 4070, as Nvidia's pricing would indicate around a 10 percent performance boost - though third-party 4070 cards are now available around $535, some distance below that original $599 MSRP.Finally, the RTX 4080 Super still looks some way off the unassailable RTX 4090, with a paltry five percent CUDA core increase versus the base 4080 model, equivalent memory allocation and scant improvements to memory and core clocks. Here, the major change is to the MSRP, with the 4080 Super being $200 cheaper than the 4080 in terms of recommended retail pricing - welcome news, given that RTX 4080 models still go for $1149 or more.All told, the release of three new models means that it may be some time before we see RTX 50-series graphics cards, which were previously rumoured to debut sometime in 2024 - but perhaps we'll hear something about these before the end of the year? In the meantime, Nvidia also announced DLSS 3 forHorizon Forbidden West, DLSS 3 for social sandbox MMOPax Deiand both RT and DLSS 3 forDiablo 4.

178,Best graphics of the year: Digital Foundry ranks its top games of 2023,"Recently the Digital Foundry team met up online to discuss the best game graphics of 2023, with Alex Battaglia, John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie nominating their favourite titles. What struck me about the list - reproduced in full at the end of the article - was how many titlesweren'tthose that were pushing the absolute boundaries of graphics technology in terms of features. Instead, the games chosen - and especially the highest ranking options - were those that were smartly designed to both serve gameplay and take full advantage of the (often limited) hardware they were running on.Hi-Fi Rushand Super Mario Bros. Wonder are perfect examples of this, I feel. Both games were first-party releases that distinguish themselves with a bold, consistent sense of style, with colourful and imaginative environments populated by characters with exaggerated movement that emphasises particular poses. In Hi-Fi Rush in particular, this is heightened further by the cel-shaded appearance and decimated animation ""on twos"" that makes the gamefeel like a playable cartoon.In both cases, the graphics and animation styles chosen serve the gameplay beautifully, with responsive controls and a living, breathing world that reacts to your actions, whether it'senemy and flower reactions in Super Mario Bros. Wonderor the world gently vibing along with the music in Hi-Fi Rush.Digital Foundry's Best Game Graphics of 2023 - PC, PS5, Xbox, Switch - Another Amazing YearHere's the full 90-minute game graphics of the year discussion for 2023, hosted by John Linneman and featuring Alex Battaglia and Oliver Mackenzie.Watch on YouTubeAnd despite shipping on two of the most constrained platforms in terms of available horsepower - the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch - both games hit their performance targets, allowing for consistently responsive gameplay in a way that many console releases didn't manage - especially on Switch, which this year saw a number of perhaps over-ambitious releases. More importantly, these two titles achieved this without relying too heavily on image reconstruction techniques to counteract a low base resolution, a technique that was used more heavily in 2023 on all platforms - and one that left many console releases severely lacking in terms of sharpness and overall image quality.The top three slots on our list this year went toCyberpunk 2077withRT Overdrive,Avatar: Frontiers of PandoraandAlan Wake 2. All these games combinestylish and performant graphicswith genuinelyboundary-pushing ray tracing techniques, with two of the three supporting full path tracing on PC - essentially wholly replacing the faked lighting systems used for years in rasterised titles with a realistic alternative that ""just works"".Even at the start of 2023 I wouldn't have expected so many AAA games to be upgraded with path tracing so successfully, as the impressive path-traced retro remakes we've seen on PC over the past few years still came with massive performance concerns. Clearly, enterprising developers and graphics card makers have made a huge amount of progress here, and that's worth celebrating. I feel like game studios have also gotten better at making these RT upgrades more obviously good-looking, in comparison to early efforts that often tanked performance with only subtle fidelity improvements.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsWhen used correctly, these RT and PT techniques can also act as a force multiplier, letting smaller studios deliver a great-looking game without requiring a massive technical and art staff, eg by eliminating the need to manually place extra lights in a scene to get a desired look. We saw a similar effect in another top 10 pick, RoboCop: Rogue City, which used Unreal Engine 5 features Lumen, Nanite and VSMs (virtual shadowmaps) to produce incredibly realistic looking environments packed with detail on a AA budget.As we look into 2024, I hope other developers and publishers are learning lessons from the technical successes - and failures - of 2023. The best games of the year from my point of view were the ones that had the time to mature, that chose graphics techniques and technologies wisely to serve gameplay and hit performance targets, rather than the other way around.None of these decisions are obvious or easy, especially in the midst of development, but there are at least some indications that studios are moving in the right direction. After all, the end of 2023 certainly saw more technical competence (and excellence) than the beginning and middle of the year. With luck, we'll see that trend continue next year, and maybe even some new consoles and graphics hardware to keep things interesting...","Recently the Digital Foundry team met up online to discuss the best game graphics of 2023, with Alex Battaglia, John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie nominating their favourite titles.

181,DF Weekly: The goalposts have shifted again in assessing console image quality,"Every week, I like to choose one specific topic to discuss from the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly - and there's certainly an embarrassment of riches to choose from in another vast episode. We sat down to film our 141th show the morning after The Game Awards, and despite the usual downplaying of expectations fromGeoff Keighley, the 'wurld prm'ears' came thick and fast. For this blog though, it's actually a supporter question that prompts this article. DF Supporter Julian Sniter asked us whether upscaling technologies like AMD's FSR and Epic's TSR are making it harder for us to'count pixels'and ascertain native resolutions. The answer is yes, but the more verbose answer is that upscaling technologies have evolved at least twice since we first started image quality testing - and it's more difficult now than ever.It's been a couple of years now since I made it a personal mission to downplay - if not eliminate completely - revealing the native rendering resolution of any given game. Back in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 era, target resolution was typically 720p and upscaling from beneath that could have a significant impact on the image quality of any given game. However, moving into the PS4 Pro/Xbox One X era, the output resolution target moved to native 4K and a whole host of intriguing upscaling technologies came into play - the most popular being checkerboard rendering (as seen in the likes ofHorizon Zero Dawn,Days Goneand many others) and temporal super-sampling/jittering (Marvel's Spider-Man andFor Honorbeing two great examples). We often refer to that latter tech as TAAU - a combination of upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing.With a few obvious outliers (The Avengers used CBR on PS5, TAAU on Xbox), the direction of travel from developers was to favour TAAU and at that point, the argument to kill pixel counts once and for all seemed unassailable. Identifiable upscaling artefacts seemed to mostly disappear in favour of clarity: the higher the internal resolution, the less blurry the image was. And the more pixels you upscaled, the less the return. There are many great examples of 'native' 1440p resolutions that could convincingly pass for a 4K image - or at least, still looked great on a 4K screen. We worked with some fantastically talented people and produced some interesting examples of a 'clarity index' that worked by comparing TAAU-upscaling to native resolution rendering between 1080p and 2160p, and effectively removed the pixel count altogether in favour of quality comparison based on what the human eye actually sees.DF Direct Weekly #141: The TGAs Reaction - Hellblade 2, OD, Marvel's Blade + Avatar Consoles Tested!Rich Leadbetter, Alex Battaglia and Oliver Mackenzie take to the mics this week in perpetrating DF Direct Weekly #141.Watch on YouTube0:00:48News 01: The Game Awards - Senua's Saga: Hellblade 20:08:51OD0:17:48No Rest for the Wicked, Monster Hunter Wilds0:26:58Marvel's Blade, Light No Fire0:39:13Black Myth: Wukong, Persona 3 Reload, Metaphor Refantazio, Skull and Bones0:51:58News 02: Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora released!1:01:58Supporter Q1: How do you pixel count games with upsampling?1:09:06Supporter Q2: Do modern games avoid physics-based gameplay because of processing constraints or game design?1:12:19Supporter Q3: Does the addition of path tracing to Call of Duty’s lobbies suggest a wider implementation later on?1:16:07Supporter Q4: Should the console makers release jailbreak patches for older consoles?1:19:38Supporter Q5: Should GPU manufacturers introduce features from Special K into their drivers?1:24:25Supporter Q6: Can you pixel count The Game Awards?TAAU was a fantastic technology for its time and still holds up well today - Insomniac still uses its own version, ITGI. Pinpointing what the native resolution actually is has academic interest, but when each frame features injected detail from several prior frames, 1440p - or whatever - becomes so much more. Another great example isInfinity Ward's upscaler in Call of Duty. A couple of years back in the team's Polish studio, I got to see native resolution rendering vs the final output on the PS4 version of Vanguard and I was amazed at the difference. And prototype tooling based on Warzone replays once again allowed us to programmatically quantify the improved image quality on Xbox One X vs PlayStation 4 Pro.And yet, a couple of years on, Digital Foundry is still pixel-counting the old-fashioned way. And to answer supporter Julian Sniter's question, yes, it's a whole lot harder than it used to be. Games with poor anti-aliasing, MSAA or even FXAA could be relatively easy to count. You find an edge and pinpoint 'actual' pixels within the 'output' pixels of the final image and the ratio you find defines the native resolution rendering. TAAU make things a lot more difficult because those edges became harder and harder to find. Not only that, you could be looking at two pixel counts - the internal resolution and whatever output resolution the game is attempting to resolve.Even so, the 'clarity index' was looking good as a replacement, but doubt began to creep in as soon as we took at Nvidia's DLSS. Remedy's Control features a pretty basic form of TAA that has plenty of noise in it - but Nvidia's DLSS, even on a lower rendering resolution, has a lower degree of noise and an arguably more pleasing image overall. A clarity index here doesn't work when comparing different upscaling methods and more than that, revealed that noise and artefacting essentially generated 'false positive' detail levels. This demonstrated that a replacement for pixel-counting would rely on the exact same upscaling techniques used between versions - something that was not always the case. And if there was no PC version at all to generate ground truth 1080p and 2160p, we'd be stuck anyway.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsAMD's FSR 2 complicated matters still further. In theory, it's a significantly superior upscaler to TAAU - which explains why so many developers have ditched older techniques in favour of it (Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 being two good examples). However, in attempting to reconstruct a native image from a much lower resolution, FSR 2 creates its own range of artefacts - ghosting, fizzle and more. At this point, we've reached the conclusion that there's no programmatic way to express image quality. FSR 2's fizzling in particular simply tells an algorithm looking to gauge clarity that there's more detail - and perhaps there is, but it's unwanted detail. At this point, a subjective breakdown of image quality and, yes, pixel counting is the best way of explaining image quality, especially in an era where 4K consoles are using FSR 2 to upscale from anything as low as 720p. The picture can look poor and the base resolution helps explain why.Is there any route forward in eliminating pixel counts for good? We were recently pointed towards a machine learning model used by Netflix and others to judge video encoding quality. You feed it the same content with various encodes and each run is given a score between 0 and 1. One of our supporters did a lot of work in attempting to use this model to compare DLSS and FSR 2. And at first, results looked interesting. DLSS always scored higher than FSR 2, which we thought would be the case bearing in mind that Nvidia's upscaler tends to deliver significantly higher quality levels than FSR 2. But the more content we tested, the less convinced we were by the results.It turns out that using a video-based model just wasn't a good fit. However, the way this encoder model was put together was intriguing: essentially, the model was trained by showing people various video comparisons and asked to score which they thought looked better. It's likely that thousands of comparisons like this were done and the model took shape from there. So, perhaps something similar could be done by comparing the various upscaling techniques available today? Perhaps in the future, AI will solve the pixel-counting problem once and for all, but for now, we're back at square one. It's all about a subjective analysis better informed by figuring out base resolution the old-fashioned way. Pixel counts themselves don't mean much, but definitely help to explain some of the poorer examples of image quality we've seen in recent times.","Every week, I like to choose one specific topic to discuss from the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly - and there's certainly an embarrassment of riches to choose from in another vast episode.

182,DF Weekly: Arkham Knight on Switch is disastrously poor,"This week's DF Direct Weekly kicks off with our 'hot take' on the state of Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. We film the show on Friday morning and so only had an hour or so with the game before we sat down to record, but we had to know the answer to one burning question: can Nintendo's handheld hybrid really runBatman: Arkham Knight? Hopes were high for another 'impossible port' but alas, the final game is practically a disaster, brutally cutback in every conceivable way and plagued with profound stuttering problems.Lighting is savagely downgraded, texture quality is a total mess, shadows take a trip back to PS2 era standards and geometry is culled. Arkham Knight routinely fails to hit its 30 frames per second target, often lingering in the low to mid-20s but worse than that is the pervasive stuttering problem. Most strongly evident in the Batmobile sections, Arkham Knight is clearly facing system-level bottlenecks at every turn: streaming environmental detail at speeds has a clearly measurable impact on the CPU, while the addition of collision physics stacks on top of that, taking performance into the teens.We've got a deeper tech review coming soon, but ultimately, this collection should never have shipped. The quality of the porting is suspect in a world where Arkham Asylum drops frames under 30fps and where the more technologically demanding Arkham City actually seems to run better on aggregate - though of course, there are the predictable struggles in denser city scenes. There's the sense that the first two games in the trilogy required more optimisation work while the entire Arkham Knight endeavour should have been canned, perhaps in favour of an adaptation of the often-overlooked Arkham Origins... or else the entire project put on pause until Switch's successor finally arrives. All being well, we're looking to deliver our full review for the Arkham Trilogy tomorrow, but having reviewed first drafts of video and text, the news doesn't get any better - in fact, it gets a lot worse.DF Direct Weekly #140: Arkham Knight Switch Disaster, Baldur's Gate 3 Perf Boost, Half-Life 2 4K60Somehow, the DF team have managed to make 140 shows, this one being the latest.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:03News 01: Arkham Knight on Switch is a disaster0:15:46News 02: Larian boosts Baldur's Gate 3 performance0:26:06News 03: The Orange Box unlocked to run at 60fps on Xbox Series consoles0:37:56News 04: Dragon's Dogma 2 trailer released0:49:05News 05: Cheat codes discovered for Gran Turismo PSP0:58:39News 06: John's VR odyssey continues!1:09:25News 07: Duke Nukem games released for Evercade1:17:17Supporter Q1: To play an older 360 game, is the best option original hardware plus a RetroTink, or a Series X?1:22:38Supporter Q2: Have PC GPUs fallen behind in performance scaling relative to consoles over this generation?1:28:28Supporter Q3: Why do some UE5 titles skip over hardware Lumen, even on PC?1:32:30Supporter Q4: Could Sony improve the PS Portal with software updates?1:41:29Supporter Q5: Could frame generation be used to improve motion blur?There's better news elsewhere in this week's DF Direct Weekly as Alex spent some time getting to grips with the fifth patch forBaldur's Gate 3- and of course, our first port of call would be Act Three, set within the city ofBaldur's Gateitself. Larian has discussed a strong optimisation push, some of it dictated by the need to get the game working on Xbox Series S, but the bottom line is that our mainstream CPU champion - the Ryzen 5 3600 gains around 22 percent in performance compared to our launch metrics. Frame-time consistency is improved too, seemingly down to optimisation of the earthquake systems that caused real issues on the launch game - though this may have been fixed before patch five, of course. While the game is still some way off 60 frames per second, what this does mean is that less strenuous content is now more likely to hit the target, while more capable CPUs are also likely to see a boost, and again, 60fps locked may be more attainable.Speaking of 60fps, we're extremely late to the party with this, butthis video from ReveriePassfrom last year recently resurfaced on X/Twitter viaf4micomand it's fascinating. Essentially, config files that define the frame-rate limit of all the titles in the Xbox 360 version ofThe Orange Boxcan be extracted on PC, tweaked, re-inserted into the config file and uploaded to the cloud via an OG 360. Xbox's seriously cool feature of cross-generation cloud synchronisation then brings that hacked config onto Xbox Series consoles. Xbox 360 lacks the horsepower to run any of The Orange Box's games at 60fps - in fact, a double-buffer v-sync sees performance jump between 30fps and 60fps randomly - but Series consoles can get the job done.There are caveats and problems, but the fact is that it is viable to play through those games at the 'right' frame-rate, which raises the question: how many more games could benefit from this software approach to FPS Boost? The Orange Box benefits on two fronts: they are X-enhanced titles already, meaning Series S runs at 1440p and Series X at 4K. This 'hack' removes the poorly implemented 30fps cap and makes the games run as they should - and it's so simple, surely Microsoft and Valve could produce an official solution. We already have one example of this: FPS Boost is typically accomplished with DirectX-level tweakery, butDark Souls 3's frame-rate unlock was seemingly a software-based solution.  We'll be taking a closer look at The Orange Box this week, including tests on Xbox One consoles and Series S.Baldur's Gate 3's latest patch has highly significant performance improvements when CPU-limited, as seen here in comparing launch performance to how it is now on a Ryzen 5 3600.And sticking with the topic of Xbox 360, there's a great supporter question in this week's Direct about the best way to play 360 titles - should users tap into Series X for the performance boosts while outputting to a modern flat panel display, or should the most committed fans buy a RetroTink 4K and use the nearest neighbour upscaling to run the 720p (or indeed 1080p on selected titles) at 4K? It's a difficult question. Series X doesn't run every Xbox 360 game and it uses its own, less than impressive scaling to run 720p content at ultra HD. Seriously, nearest neighbour upscaling looks so much better.The problem is that the Xbox 360 era is one of the worst performing of any console generation - and Xbox back compat makes a big, big difference. John's solution for the ultra-elite, money-no-object user? Set your Xbox Series X to 720p and then use the RetroTink for nearest neighbour upscaling! It's an extreme solution to say the least, but maybe a simpler solution would be a nice new scaling option for Series users from Microsoft. That's just one of the fun, interesting ideas offered up by supporters this week, which makes DF Direct Weekly's supporter Q+A section so interesting.Also intriguing: will today's console-equivalent PC parts eventually get out-performed by PS5 and Series X? The answer is definitely yes, but we're putting the methodology into place to keep track of where CPU and GPU lies. Look out for that later this month or early next year!","This week's DF Direct Weekly kicks off with our 'hot take' on the state of Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. We film the show on Friday morning and so only had an hour or so with the game before we sat down to record, but we had to know the answer to one burning question: can Nintendo's handheld hybrid really run Batman: Arkham Knight ? Hopes were high for another 'impossible port' but alas, the final game is practically a disaster, brutally cutback in every conceivable way and plagued with profound stuttering problems.

183,DF Weekly: Do we actually need The Last of Us Part 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn remasters?,"DF Direct Weekly typically focuses on the week's gaming and technology news, but the latest episode actually kicks off with a story we missed from seven days prior: the announcement of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. Rumours have circled this project for months now and we've often wondered why Sony andNaughty Dogwould embark on a remaster for a game that doesn't need remastering - and already has 60 frames per second support for PlayStation 5. Now, everything has come into focus but is it a worthwhile endeavour?Well, with the details we now have in terms of features and pricing, I don't think there are any significant concerns remaining - just that perhaps that the term 'remastered' in the title is a little misplaced. Essentially, what we're dealing with here is broadly equivalent to a release along the lines ofDeath Stranding: Director's Cut. It's the original game with a dash of extra content and additional visual modes that tap into the power of PlayStation 5. Yes, Sony is likely to release this with a premium price, but there's a £10/$10 upgrade fee for owners of the original PS4 release - and of course, there's nothing stopping anyone from procuring a used disc and upgrading from there. A free upgrade for PS5 would have been welcome, of course, but similar to Ghosts of Tsushima, there's already a 60fps patch available that doesn't cost anything at all.Based on Sony's PR, other enhancements are in line with the changes made for The Last of Us Part 1 and the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection. Primarily, The Last of Us Part 2 becomes a native PlayStation 5 app, primarily gaining access to graphics features from the RDNA2 GPU liberated from back-compat mode, along with more memory. This opens the door to a native 4K fidelity mode, higher resolution textures along with increased level of detail and animation sample rates. The kind of HDMI 2.1 features we've seen previously also appear, meaning that the door's open to a 40fps fidelity mode along with unlocked VRR frame-rates. In combination with the new survival mode and 'lost levels' content, that's a pretty compelling package for the upgrade fee being asked, while the game is refreshed and ready to appear on the shelves for new PlayStation 5 owners to buy.DF Direct Weekly #139: The Last Of Us 2 Remastered, CP2077 Ray Reconstruction Revisit, Xbox SalesFancy spending upwards of two hours with the Digital Foundry team.

Do the American expats at DF celebrate Thanksgiving in their new European homes?What was curious was the lack of any kind of PC announcement for the project. We know that the game was leaked early, ahead of time, ruining Naughty Dog's marketing plans - so is this an attempt to keep hold of at least one further marketing opportunity? Or was the negative reaction to The Last of Us Part 1 so potent that Sony and Naughty Dog would rather side-step that particular for now? The truth is that after months of further development, the studio did manage to get PC into shape and although still somewhat heavy on both CPU and GPU, the PC version of the sequel should launch in a good state.Beyond that, concerns that Naughty Dog would be remastering a game that didn't need remastering end up being mostly irrelevant - what we're looking at is a next-gen update, if you will, along with some DLC-style bonus content. The Last of Us Part 1, this is not. However, the notion of a new rendition of The Last of Us Part 2 was just one part of a wider rumour (still unconfirmed) that also included a revamp ofHorizon Zero Dawn, a game that debuted in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro before eventually receiving a 60fps patch for PS5 in September 2021. Is a remaster actually necessary?In this week's DF Direct Weekly, my colleagues don't sound particularly keen on the idea and it would require a highly compelling pitch to sell us on a game that isn't actually that old. Whether it's Guerrilla itself or a closely-associated third party studio involved, there's the sense that developers' time may be better spent on an original new game. And if we're looking at a 'Director's Cut' project like The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, the impact may be quite limited - a limited visual revamp would not compare favourably withHorizon Forbidden Westin the way that TLOU Part 2 Remastered stacks up against The Last of Us Part 1.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe alternative would be a full remake based on the latest Decima technology - not an insignificant undertaking, but likely cheaper to produce than a completely new game and a sure-fire win for Sony in terms of sales success, assuming the software is up to par... and it would be unwise for anyone to underestimate Guerrilla's commitment to quality. A generational revamp to visuals, image quality, character rendering, animation quality could still be a highly impressive product, even before we consider gameplay revamps and the kind of commitment to accessibility features Sony now fully embraces. And if we consider the ninth generation of consoles to persist until 2028, a Horizon Zero Dawn remake would slot in quite nicely between Forbidden West essentially kicking off Guerrilla's contribution to this console generation, and the end of a potential trilogy closer to the end of it.Of course, as John points out in this week's Direct, there's a significantly stronger case for remastering theKillzonetitles from PlayStation 3 and Shadowfall on PS4 - games that would genuinely stand to benefit from the usual enhancements remastering delivers and where today's gameplay sensibilities could genuinely improve gameplay. However, for whatever reason, Sony and Guerrilla do seem to have left that particular franchise behind and there are few, if any, indicators that this situation is likely to change. And on a more general note, Sony's more avant garde experimentation with PS5 releases also seems to be over - we've yet to see any kind of successor to Astro's Playroom, for example: smaller, but still highly worthwhile and beguiling titles. Bring back Knack!That's just the first news topic in the latest DF Direct Weekly, which you can watch embedded further up this page. We also spend some time discussing the curious situation of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition - which seems to be more ultimate on one platform than another, while Alex discusses improvements to the game's DLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction technology - via both organic updates and by swapping in the Alan Wake 2 .dll. Alex is also pretty taken with the latest StarEngine game engine trailer, while I finally unbox the PlayStation 5 Slim! Yes, there is a console inside the box that I bought and I removed that console from within that box in front of a camera in the most compelling DF Direct segment yet!

186,DF Weekly: PlayStation Portal's quality is reliant on your home network set-up,"This week's Digital Foundry Direct Weekly kicks off with first impressions on Sony's PlayStation Portal, which we received around the same time that the embargo lifted. Since then, the device has already sold out and in my experience, it's already commanding anything up to a £150 price premium. Well, it's a bit of a stretch to justify its £199 sticker price and I wouldn't recommend paying a penny more. When it works, it's fine, but I can't help but think that a first-party device from a console manufacturer should not ship in a state where the core quality of the device is entirely reliant on third-party equipment it has no oversight over.That's the key thing about console gaming, in my opinion. Every device is the same, so by extension, the gameplay experience should be quantifiably and qualitatively identical for every user. By relying exclusive on its existing Remote Play functionality - a value-added extra, remember - the quality of gameplay on the Portal is reliant on a massive range of factors outside of Sony's control.Owing to existing commitments, I've only spent a few hours with PlayStation Portal and I've only tested it in two scenarios. I'd say that the first scenario is close to perfect conditions: the PlayStation 5 and my home router are within 1m of each other, hooked up via a LAN cable. This means that there's effectively no latency between the console and the router. Secondly, the Portal itself is within 1-1.5m of the router.DF Direct Weekly #138: PlayStation Portal Hands-On, Steam Deck OLED vs ROG Ally, Suicide SquadDF Direct Weekly #138 covers off a range of topics - and the PlayStation Portal is our lead story.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:52News 01: PlayStation Portal first impressions!0:26:47News 02: New Suicide Squad deep dive video lands0:45:01News 03: RetroTink 4K to cost $750 USD1:00:42News 04: EA WRC PC update1:08:59News 05: Steam Deck OLED vs ROG Ally!1:25:12News 06: John's continuing Meta Quest adventures1:37:23Supporter Q1: Will we ever see an arcade racing resurgence?1:43:53Supporter Q2: Did Starfield ship 'unoptimised'? Why did it take so long to improve performance and add DLSS?1:54:27Supporter Q3: Is it possible Nintendo’s next console will be a traditional home system?1:58:30Supporter Q4: Is the Xbox One the only console to be obsoleted completely by its successor?2:04:19Supporter Q5: Will you ever do a retrospective on failed past consoles, like the Ouya?In this scenario, the Portal works OK. By placing the Portal in front of my LG OLED CX running the console directly in low latency game mode, usingGran Turismo 7's on-screen timer, I can see that there's about 60ms of extra lag. That's not too bad, but definitely noticeable. Essentially, a 60fps game likeMarvel's Spider-Man 2running in performance mode feels like a 30fps experience, but it's OK - just not great. Bothersome are the banding artefacts, smearing in fast movement and occasional frame-drops. And that's in what I'd describe as a best case scenario.The second test I did was to leave the room, go downstairs and play in my lounge - about 12m away. The WiFi quality icon drops down a bar, connecting to the PS5 takes longer and gameplay is nothing like the same as it was next to the router. Video quality changes from best to what I guess is medium quality at points, there are times when the feed momentarily freezes and whatever the performance level is, it's certainly nothing like the close-to-60fps I had next to the router. I should stress that my home only has plasterboard walls - no brickwork or concrete involved!This is what makes PlayStation Portal reviews so challenging - and why you're seeing such a wide range of different experiences on social media. Everyone's home network experience will be different, so the quality of the gameplay experience will not be the same.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsWhere it will be the same is in terms of the nature of the device itself, which is perfectly fine. PlayStation Portal looks like a DualSense controller cleaved into two with a large LCD panel added in-between and that's exactly what it is. The quality of the display itself is good, with nice colour reproduction, let down only by relatively mediocre black levels. It is, however, bright and vibrant - and large. And as you're buying a DualSense, you're getting a DualSense with identical haptics and feedback to the real thing. This is all the kind of stuff you won't be getting from other Remote Play solutions and in that sense, the Portal is in a class of its own.I've not talked about image quality, but it's at best fine. It's good enough but easily discernable from a native image. On first boot, the Portal presents its own native representation of the PS5 front-end, but once you hook up to the console via Remote Play, the streamed version of the front-end is a disappointment with obvious banding. I'm just a little surprised that there's no evidence of any custom improvements made to Remote Play - such as higher quality streaming options for those whose networks can take it.So, that's where I sit with the Portal after a few hours of play. Sony promised a repackaged version of Remote Play and that's what you get. There's a lot more testing I'd like to complete before posting a full review, but assuming the chance to buy one crops up - and you're tempted - I'd say that you should try normal Remote Play first to see if your home network is up to it. You'll also get a good preview of how good image quality actually is and if that's good enough for you.","This week's Digital Foundry Direct Weekly kicks off with first impressions on Sony's PlayStation Portal, which we received around the same time that the embargo lifted.

188,DF Weekly: Testing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on the worst PS5 SSD money can buy,"There's an embarrassment of riches in the 136th edition of DF Direct Weekly, spread across almost two hours of 'content'. We discuss the good and the bad points of the Modern Warfare 3 campaign and EA's WRC, we spend time talking about how impressive the Switch port ofSuper Mario RPGis and share impressions on Apple's newly announced M3 processor line-up. However, for this Eurogamer blog, I'm going to talk about what it's like to runMarvel's Spider-Man 2on the slowest, quantifiably worst PCIe Gen 4 SSD 'upgrade' money can buy.Long-time readers/viewers of Digital Foundry may recall that back in the day, when the PS5's M.2 bay was enabled,we stacked up the internal storage solution with the best and worst PCI Gen 4 SSDs of the time. The Western Digital SN750 SE 250GB is a bit of a stinker to be honest. At just 3200MB/s of bandwidth, it falls well short of the 5500MB/s demanded by Sony, not to mention the 7000MB/s recommended by Mark Cerny when the PS5 was first revealed. It also lacks any kind of DRAM cache, which isn't helpful. Even so, while slower at transfers, the drive still performed well. It could even run Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart just fine.

Remarkably, the drive still works in the PlayStation 5. According to the PS5's internal benchmark tool, this gives the console just 1782MB/s of bandwidth to work with, suggesting that the drive 'might not be fast enough' to play PS5 games seamlessly.Enter Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Insomniac uses the I/O set-up of the PlayStation 5 to facilitate much faster traversal than prior titles and while I won't spoil the specifics, an earlier mission sees the studio bring back the portal technology of Ratchet and Clank, with a segment that sees Miles Morales not only travelling through New York at full pelt, but also switching between locations using portals. In a kind of ghoulish way, I was curious to see how Insomniac's systems may fail when its challenging technology meets a piece of hardware that's nowhere near the required specifications.But here's the thing: it still works just fine in the content I tested, the only noticeable difference coming from ultra-fast loading times losing a second or two when starting the game, with some in-game segments heavy on storage lagging a few frames behind - but with no signs of any actual performance drops.Not only the worst PCIe Gen 4 drive we're aware of, but we've also taped off most of the pins to restrict its bandwidth. On the right there, the PS5 attempts to warn us of our folly. Click on the thumbnails for higher resolution images.Put simply, even with already curtailed bandwidth savagely cut back, what we saw with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 mirrored the results seen in Rift Apart - and it's at this point that we should probably put solid state storage into context of the entire I/O system within the PlayStation 5 because the amount of bandwidth available to the system is just one component of the entire set-up. We see it all the time on PC, where in games, even SATA SSDs can hold up relatively well against NVMe alternatives in many applications - and where it's often tough to tell the difference between PCIe Gen 3 and PCIe Gen 4 SSDs in the general run of play.There are two further elements of the PS5's I/O system that should be highlighted and only one is actually to do with the SSD itself - the fact that there are no moving parts. This means that, unlike a mechanical hard drive, there is no head moving around the surface of the disk, seeking out required data. With an SSD, there's effectively instant access to any part of the drive. And perhaps with the kind of data being streamed by the Insomniac engine, massive levels of bandwidth aren't required. Many smaller chunks of data are far more likely to be required as opposed to larger chunks.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsThe other crucial element is the fact that PlayStation 5's Kraken decompression blocks seem to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting for the new console. Compressed data is streamed from storage, then decompressed via hardware with no real CPU impact whatsoever. We know for sure that Insomniac does a lot of work in optimising its systems to make as much use of this hardware as possible.So, I was expecting something to break with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 running on an SSD with this poor of a spec, but ultimately, everything seemed to work just fine and I played a couple of hours through with no issues. However, while I suspect that most games will run just fine on just about any kind of PCIe Gen 4 SSD you add to your PlayStation 5, we've now reached the point where drives that meet Sony's required specifications are very, very cheap. There's no need to opt for something cheap and cheerful when drives that meet the 5500MB/s bandwidth requirement are also inexpensive - and with Black Friday just around the corner, expect to see another deluge of deals.","There's an embarrassment of riches in the 136th edition of DF Direct Weekly, spread across almost two hours of 'content'.

189,DF Weekly: Alan Wake 2 delivers a day of reckoning for older PC GPU owners,"We'd been expecting a game to arrive that would practically demand that you upgrade your PC hardware, and it's not entirely surprising that it would be Remedy'sAlan Wake 2. However, what we didn't expect was it would be support for DX12 mesh shader hardware that would be the dividing line between a good experience and a bad one. Practically, what this means is that there's bad news here for owners of vintage 2016/2017 Nvidia GTX 10-series Pascal hardware as Alan Wake 2 performance is pretty dire, even on the majestic GTX 1080 Ti. The lack of mesh shader support also means that AMD's vintage 2019 RDNA 1 cards also suffer, though not quite to the same degree.You can read all about what mesh shaders actually areelsewhere, but the bottom line is that it more easily allows for the efficient processing of detail-rich scenes - and Alan Wake 2 is awash with incredibly high detail assets. On PC, fallbacks exist to allow the game to run on older GPUs, but you have to accept some alarming drops in performance. Even on GTX 1080 Ti, I noted that the game could drop into the teens running at 1080p, upscaled from 720p using FSR 2 quality mode. In those same scenes, the RTX 2080 - often cited as having similar rasterisation performance to the 1080 Ti - runs 6.3x faster.Those results are something of an outlier, but even in more standard AW2 gaming, there's still a stark divide between three GPUs that generally have similar rasterisation capabilities. In the forest at the beginning of the game, the RTX 2080 beats 1080 Ti with an additional 177 percent of performance, while the RX 5700 XT is 63 percent faster than the Pascal legend.DF Direct Weekly #135: Alan Wake 2 - A Tech Masterpiece, MGS 'Master' Collection, Star Citizen!Alan Wake 2 dominates discussion in Digital Foundry Direct Weekly #135.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:00:45News 01: Alan Wake 2: a tech masterpiece0:34:12News 02: New PS5 needs internet to pair disc drive0:42:18News 03: MGS Master Collection Volume 1 released0:58:16News 04: MGS Delta Snake Eater demoed1:07:37News 05: Star Citizen improvements, new content shown off at CitizenCon1:21:48Supporter Q1: Given that Alan Wake 2 doesn’t support Pascal GPUs, is it time for a GTX 1080/Ti eulogy?1:28:51Supporter Q2: Any thoughts on Intel's 14th gen CPUs?1:31:24Supporter Q3: How could Horizon Zero Dawn and TLOU 2 be meaningfully remastered for PS5?1:40:53Supporter Q4: Are better visual features really worth the image quality hit on consoles?1:49:10Supporter Q5: What are John's impressions of the Meta Quest 3?A day of reckoning was always coming for 10-series cards and up until the release of Alan Wake 2, the smart money would have been on mandatory support for hardware accelerated ray tracing representing the main reason to upgrade. The idea that it would be mesh shaders that would represent the dividing line does come as a bit of a surprise, but the bottom line is that the current generation consoles' support for RT is a little lacklustre, while mesh shading support clearly works, as Alan Wake 2 looks stunning on today's consoles. Even PlayStation 5, which features a less robust geometry engine, seems to deliver good results and strong performance.The general panic surrounding Alan Wake's PC performance was amplified somewhat by recommended specs from Remedy itself, which - I think it's fair to say - are somewhat conservative. Remedy lists the AMD Radeon RX 6600 as a base-spec GPU for Alan Wake 2, citing 1080p at low settings at 30fps in terms of expectation levels for that class of hardware. We must be looking at absolute worst case scenarios there, because even on the equivalent of PS5's quality mode (essentially the medium preset, with low quality post-processing), the game runs much faster than that.It also turns out that the mesh shader requirement for good performance means that GPUs that are far less capable than the RX 6600 work surprisingly well. Take Nvidia's GTX 16-class GPUs, for example. You can think of them as RTX 20-series offerings with the RT and tensor cores stripped out and while performance of, say, the GTX 1660 Ti is weaker than an RTX 2060 generally, I could still play Alan Wake at PS5 quality mode settings at 1080p resolution using FSR 2 quality mode and performance remained above 30fps. This is because some DX12 features such as variable rate shading and - yes - mesh shaders are still supported on those cut-back Turing GPUs.Alan Wake 2 PC - Rasterisation Optimised Settings Breakdown - Is It Really THAT Demanding?Looking at the console versions of Alan Wake 2 demonstrates how you can still get a fantastic-looking PC experience without needing to spend a fortune on an absolute top-end GPU.Watch on YouTubeThere are still a vast amount of 10-series GTX cards in use though, and the concept of effectively being forced to upgrade your PC can be troublesome because pricing in the graphics market hasn't been great in recent times. However, there are plenty of strong options that needn't break the bank. The RX 6600 may have limited RT performance, but it does support the full DX12 Ultimate feature set and it's typically available around the $180/£180 mark. Meanwhile, I noted over the weekend that the more useful RX 6650 XT now sits just north of $200/£200 on sale. There's also much to commend the RTX 3060 12GB and the RTX 4060 8GB. One has more memory, the other has better performance and frame generation - both are now available well below $299/£299. If you spent £500-£600 on the GTX 1080 Ti back in the day, a similar amount of money gets you an RX 7800 XT or RTX 4070, both of which represent solid upgrades.In short, Alan Wake 2 may be demanding an upgrade for those on older GPUs, but the game is scalable enough to ensure you don't need to be spending thousands on an RTX 4090 to be able to enjoy an excellent experience from the game. And the truth is, while Alan Wake 2 has very specific requirements with game-changing performance benefits, the move away from cross-gen releases towards titles specifically targeting PS5-class hardware has necessitated the need for more horsepower outside of the graphics arena.An SSD is essentially mandatory now for the latest games, but perhaps more impactful is the need for more powerful CPU. There was a time when Zen 2 class Ryzens like the classic Ryzen 5 3600 usually proved more than enough to hit a 60fps baseline - but more and more games are requiring something much meatier. Right now, I'd be recommending a Ryzen 5 5600 or Intel Core i5 12400F as the minimum for a mainstream build - and this in itself may require the purchase of a new motherboard and perhaps some memory too. At least Ryzen 5000 is compatible with a range of older boards and in the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, it's possible to extend the life of a 2018-class gaming PC to a surprising extent.Alan Wake 2 may represent a watershed of sorts for PC gaming, while mesh shader support practically demands a GPU upgrade for those with older video cards. However, console users have had to upgrade from Xbox One/PS4 to Xbox Series/PS5 and there always comes a time when a new game - or a new wave of games - demands some kind of PC upgrade. But to put it plainly: trust me, Alan Wake 2 is worth it.","We'd been expecting a game to arrive that would practically demand that you upgrade your PC hardware, and it's not entirely surprising that it would be Remedy's Alan Wake 2 .

192,DF Weekly: Is AMD's FSR 3 frame generation actually useful for consoles?,"The latest edition of DF Direct Weekly arrives today, discussing Red Dead Redemption's 60fps upgrade for PlayStation 5 consoles, plus controversy surrounding Microsoft's Forza Motorsport presentation - where debut media features ray tracing effects considerably more impressive than the shipping game's. We also follow up on our recent coverage on AMD's FSR 3 frame generation by seeing just how effective the technology is on console-equivalent hardware in the wake of Ascendant Studios suggesting that they're looking into its application forImmortals of Aveum.We're on the record in expressing some degree of caution about frame generation on consoles, for all the reasons statedhere. Essentially, frame generation has a computational cost of its own, so even if you have a game running at a rock-solid 60 frames per second, there's no guarantee whatsoever that your frame-rate is amplified to 120fps. The same thing applies when considering a 60fps upgrade from 30fps, of course. On top of that, there are latency concerns (input lag will be worse) plus the issues we saw with frame-pacing in our first look.However, I wanted to see what could be donepotentiallywith FSR 3 for consoles and we have PC components that are very close, or at least ballpark, to console hardware. On the CPU side, we have the AMD 4800S Desktop Kit,which is literally the Xbox Series X CPU paired with 16GB of GDDR6 memory. We also have the non-XT version of the RX 6700, which in terms of RDNA 2 compute units and texture mapping units is eerily similar to the PlayStation 5 graphics core. We call this our 'Frankenstein's Console' and with FSR 3 in Immortals of Aveum, there are some interesting results to share.DF Direct Weekly #132: Red Dead PS5 60FPS, Forza Motorsport RT Controversy, FSR 3 Console SimulationHere's DF Direct Weekly #132, with Rich Leadbetter, Alex Battaglia and a returning John Linneman perpetrating this one.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:25News 01: 60fps Red Dead Redemption patch released on PS50:12:03News 02: Forza Motorsport reaction - and what’s up with the game's RT downgrade?0:28:56News 03: FSR 3: could it work on consoles?0:43:42News 04: Ubisoft adds Denuvo DRM to Assassin's Creed Mirage post-release0:51:20News 05: Horizon Forbidden West to be first two-disc PS5 title1:03:03News 06: Intel Arc A580 budget GPU leaks1:11:34News 07: Nightdive mulling unofficial game enhancements1:17:30Supporter Q1: John, how was your trip to Japan?1:32:08Supporter Q2: Should Sony increase the internal storage on PS5?1:34:26Supporter Q3: If the Switch 2 uses DLSS at low handheld-class resolutions, will this hurt image quality?1:37:30Supporter Q4: What do you suggest to prevent OLED burn-in while gaming?1:43:07Supporter Q5: Can you end the show with 'This Is Digital Foundry, bidding you farewell und auf wiedersehen'?Let's begin with the most obvious application - 120 frames per second gaming. Ascendant Studio targets 60 frames per second in Immortals of Aveum, though a recent patch introduced a hit to performance in favour of improved image quality. Even so, there is the scope for a 1080p120 presentation using FSR 3, which I tested using FSR 2 performance mode at low settings, upscaling from a native 540p. The result? Anything from 70fps to 100fps, settling on an average 90fps across my capture. There's a potential application here then and perhaps a more bespoke implementation could improve those performance numbers. Even so, this would require VRR to work in order to be effective - and variable refresh rate support for FSR 3 on the PC side does not seem to work right now. These results falls into line with my expectations: we can't hit 120fps because frame generation has its own computational cost.The second test concerns using frame generation to hit 60 frames per second - and here's where I was genuinely surprised. Part of the reason why frame-gen 'works' is that at high frame-rates, the lower quality 'interpolated' frames are strobed at high speeds with higher quality 'native' frames. It takes recurring issues across multiple generated frames to register image quality problems. However, if you're targeting 60 frames per second, the generated frames persist for twice as long and therefore the issues are much easier to notice.In this week's DF Direct episode, you'll see that FSR 3 frame-gen actually holds up very, very well at 60 frames per second, running with FSR 2 balanced mode at an 1800p output (quality mode dropped too many frames for my comfort). Bearing in mind that aggressive FSR 2 upscaling doesn't look great, the ability to 'mix and match' with FSR 3 frame generation could actually increase quality. Frame-gen reduces the need to generate so many native frames and in return, FSR 2 quality levels could rise.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsIn terms of intrusive artefacts, in Immortals of Aveum at least, it's only really the half-rate update on UI elements that really sticks out. Those 30fps elements are actually a stark reminder of the 'native' frames you're seeing, so juxtaposed against the 60fps output, it makes the quality of the final presentation all the more impressive.So, are we looking at a 60fps console nirvana thanks to FSR 3? There are two problems. Firstly, frame generation does incur a latency penalty. I found an area in Immortals of Aveum that I could run at 60fps with frame-gen off, then ran input lag measurements with FSR 3 on and off. Without frame-gen, we got an alarmingly high (for a 60fps game) 95.2ms. Engaging FSR 3 bumped that up to 122.7ms - a 27.5ms increase to overall lag. That's with Radeon AntiLag enabled.To see how 122.7ms compares to a range of 60fps games, I've embedded below a table oflatency measurements Tom Morgan took back in the day across a range of console titles running (mostly) at 60fps. These are for PS4 era games, but I'd expect similar numbers to persist into the current generation. The conclusion you may draw is that a frame generated 60fps experience would be lucky to match the input lag of a 30fps game.TitleInput LagTarget Frame-RateCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare39.3ms60fpsCall of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered40.3ms60fpsBattlefield 156.1ms60fpsHalo 563.0ms60fpsBattlefield 463.7ms60fpsTitanfall 260fpsOverwatch76.8ms60fpsDoom 201686.8ms60fpsKillzone Shadowfall Multiplayer89.8ms60fpsKillzone Shadowfall Single-Player110.0ms30fpsThe second challenge is - once again - the fact that FSR 3 has a computational cost. I required a base frame-rate in the region of 40 frames per second to achieve something close to a locked 60fps with frame-gen enabled. In this scenario, I'd be tempted to opt for a 40fps cap in a 120Hz container - as seen in titles like Ratchet and Clank andA Plague Tale: Requiem. However, with that said, that's not necessarily an option for a majority of users, who may not have access to a 120Hz display.In conclusion, I'm still of the opinion that FSR 3 is not a cure-all for consoles that would make all 30fps games run at 60fps, or 60fps titles run at 120fps. However, there are obvious applications where the technology could be useful. First of all, for lower impact games that already run at 60fps just fine on consoles, there may well be the overhead left over to bump up performance well into high refresh rate territory - though I'd really like to see VRR working here to ensure a smooth experience. The second potential application would be in delivering more 60fps games, with the proviso that (once again) a good degree of GPU overhead would be required and that response time will be compromised.Whichever way you slice it, what we have here is another tool available to developers. Quite how it can be meaningfully deployed remains to be seen - but as it's part of AMD's GPUOpen initiative, there's nothing stopping game makers customising it. Beyond that, if Immortals of Aveum on consoles does receive a frame generation upgrade, I can't wait to see it bearing in mind the results I saw in my own testing.","The latest edition of DF Direct Weekly arrives today, discussing Red Dead Redemption's 60fps upgrade for PlayStation 5 consoles, plus controversy surrounding Microsoft's Forza Motorsport presentation - where debut media features ray tracing effects considerably more impressive than the shipping game's.

196,DF Weekly: Should we expect more than last-gen console performance on Switch 2?,"It's Monday, meaning it's time for us to publicly deploy the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly - and one of the topics covered this week concernsevidence from Activision's Bobby Kotickto the FTC during the Microsoft trial, more specifically the idea that he was briefed on the technology last year and believes that the hardware 'has closer alignment' with the last-gen consoles. This raises an interesting question: how can this be the case in a world where strongly sourced rumours suggests that Epic Games has its The Matrix Awakens demo running on target Switch 2 hardware?The concept of 'target hardware' has always raised some concerns when it comes to accurately representing what an actual retail console can deliver, but everything I'm hearing about the machine does sound quite promising. For now, let's focus instead on the concept of closer alignment to the last-gen systems. The issue here is that an assessment of basic horsepower factors out so much of what makes a particular piece of gaming hardware unique.The original Switch makes a pretty good case, but the Steam Deck is an even more obvious example. Where we've been able to benchmark the system in like-for-like terms against PlayStation 4 (for example, using God of War's PS4-a-like 'original' settings) I found that the Deck delivers at 800p what the Sony console offers up at 1080p. However, in other titles, we've seen closer parity between Deck and PS4. Contrary to this narrative though, it's also possible to run PS5 exclusive Ratchet and Clank rather well on the Valve handheld. There's a strong argument that it's not the level of horsepower that's important, but rather how well it is deployed.DF Direct Weekly #130: Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty Reaction, Can MK1 Switch Be Fixed?

Where the new Switch fits in is difficult to nail down, but we should expect more CPU performance from it than the PS4 could muster, while I suspect Nintendo would likely opt for eMMC storage internally as opposed to a small form-factor M.2 SSD (not quite as good as an SSD, but far better than an HDD). Even so, where Steam Deck benefits in terms of improved CPU and storage performance, I'd expect the same from the next Nintendo console.However, it's the GPU that could prove more exciting. In terms of basic grunt, likening it to the last-gen consoles is probably on point. However, there is much more to the graphics core than the limited functionality of technology designed well over a decade ago. Its application may be limited, but the mooted T239 chip heavily rumoured for thenext Switchfeatures hardware-accelerated ray tracing features and if The Matrix Awakens demo is using them, that's quite remarkable. The entire DX12 Ultimate feature set will be in there, meaning mesh shaders, VRS and even sampler feedback will be available. Outside of the GPU, T239 also has a hardware decompression block for faster loading too.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsIt's DLSS that could be the real gamechanger, however. Recently I've acquired a laptop with an RTX 2050, which despite its name uses the same Ampere GPU architecture as the T239, but has a complement of 2048 CUDA cores up against the 1536 suggested for the new Switch. Even so, even with clock speeds on the RTX 2050 massively throttled back to match OG Switch, DLSS is profoundly useful. I'll be sharing more of my testing soon, but in a living room environment, DLSS at 1080p and 1440p in quality and performance presets still passes muster. Both of those are upscaling from an internal 720p. Even running at low clocks,Death Strandingat 1080p using DLSS quality mode ran 28 percent faster than the same content rendering at native 1080p.What really excites me about a new Switch isn't just the hardware though. It's the continuity of the spirit of innovation and optimisation that saw the existing Nintendo hybrid deliver games we'd never have thought possible when the hardware was announced. When the Digital Foundry staff first saw Switch hands-on, we got what we expected to see - essentially a handheld form of performance more in line with the Wii U or Xbox 360. However, as the generation progressed, we saw so many remarkable ports via the developers like Rebellion North, Saber Interactive and Panic Button. They got to know the hardware, they exploited its strengths and worked around its weaknesses.Have a read aboutZombie Army 4or watchour interview with id Software and Panic Buttonon Doom Eternal. Now imagine that same level of application and enterprise applied to a brand new Nintendo hybrid. It's mouthwatering stuff - and that's before we've even started to consider what Nintendo itself will be delivering on its new machine.","It's Monday, meaning it's time for us to publicly deploy the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly - and one of the topics covered this week concerns evidence from Activision's Bobby Kotick to the FTC during the Microsoft trial, more specifically the idea that he was briefed on the technology last year and believes that the hardware 'has closer alignment' with the last-gen consoles.

197,Inside DLSS 3.5 and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty: discussing the future of PC graphics,"UPDATE:Digital Foundry has just completed its review ofCyberpunk 20772.0 on PC, with a strong focus on the new ray tracing innovations added to the game in the form of DLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction. This new technology aims to drastically improve denoising. With current forms of RT, rays are traced - but they are limited in number compared to reality, producing a 'noisy' image that requires processing to increase coherency. Different effects may require different denoisers and all of them are tuned by human input. Ray reconstruction aims to take that task out of the hands of the developers, relying on machine learning to do a better and faster job.The end result is a cleaner image with more detail, less ghosting and faster response when lighting conditions drastically change.Alex Battaglia calls it ""a wastershed moment for real-time ray tracing""while at the same time acknowledging that it's an emergent technology that still needs finessing - similar to DLSS 2.0 when it launch a few years back. Posterisation effects, oversharpening and some smearing artefacts are eerily reminiscent of the weaknesses we saw with DLSS 2.0 and particularly in low-light scenarios, they can surface here. If the fidelity of the tech follows the same course as DLSS 2.0, we would expect these artefacts to improve and eventually resolve in due course.We hope you enjoy the video and find it to be a useful addition to the DLSS 3.5 roundtable we published earlier in the week. The embargo for publishing video review content forPhantom Libertylifts next week, and we'll be reporting back on that, looking more closely at the console releases.Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 - PC Tech Review - DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction Deep DiveWith Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 now available and the DLSS 3.5 enhancements in place, here's Digital Foundry's 26 minute deep dive into ray reconstruction, how it works, why we need it, where it excels and where we hope to see improvement.Watch on YouTubeOriginal Story:How's this for a crossover episode? Alex Battaglia recently hosted a roundtable discussion on AI and the future of game graphics, sharing the stage with representatives from GPU maker Nvidia, Cyberpunk 2077 developersCD Projekt REDand the PCMR subreddit. The talk comes on the eve of the release of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 and the game's Phantom Liberty expansion, featuring a newly expanded range of technologies includingDLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction.It's a fascinating chat well worth watching in full via the embedded video below, but I'd like to dig into one aspect of the conversation that I found particularly interesting: the idea that while image upscaling and frame generation techniques could be seen as crutches used by developers to ignore optimisation work, but viewed another way they are tools that allow visuals to reach heights that wouldn't otherwise be possible.Jakub Knapik of CDPR makes the point quite eloquently by comparing Cyberpunk's path-traced graphics with that of Big Hero 6, the 2014 release that was one of the first path-traced animated films - and another project that renders a dense cityscape in many of its scenes. Rendering each frame of the movie took several hours, but less than a decade later, consumer graphics cards are able to render a scene within roughly the same ballpark of graphical complexity in Cyberpunk 2077 at 60 frames per second.Inside DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction + Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty - AI Visuals RoundtableHere's the full roundtable interview, featuring DF's Alex Battaglia alongside Bryan Catanzaro (vice president, applied deep learning research at Nvidia), Jakub Knapik (VP and global art director at CD Projekt RED), Jacob Freeman (GeForce evangelist at Nvidia) and Pedro Valadas (PCMR subreddit founder).Watch on YouTube00:00:00Introduction00:01:10When did the DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction project start and why?00:04:16How did you get DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction up and running?00:06:17What was it like to integrate DLSS 3.5 for Cyberpunk 2077?00:10:21What are the new game inputs for DLSS 3.5?00:11:25Can DLSS 3.5 be used for hybrid ray tracing titles and not just path traced ones?00:12:41What is the target performance budget for DLSS 3.5?00:14:10Is DLSS a crutch for bad performance optimisation in PC games?00:20:19What makes machine learning specifically useful for denoising?00:24:00Why is DLSS naming kind of confusing?00:27:03What did the new denoising enable for Cyberpunk 2077's graphical vision?00:32:10Will Nvidia still focus on performance without DLSS at native resolutions?00:38:26What prompted the change internally at Nvidia to move away from DLSS 1.0 and pursue DLSS 2.0?00:43:43What do you think about DLSS mods for games that lack DLSS?00:49:52Where can machine learning go in the future for games beyond DLSS 3.5?It's incredible progress and only possible thanks to these many 'cheats' - image upscaling, frame generation and now ray reconstruction - alongside significant progress in terms of hardware that accelerates many parts of the ray tracing pipeline.As Jakub says, basically anything that allows for greater performance could be considered a cheat in the same way - even now basic technologies like level of detail (LOD), which simplifies distant geometry to save performance - so what really matters ishowthese tools are used.As we saw inImmortals of Aveum, it's possible to be perhaps rely too heavily on image reconstruction, which exhibited anoverly soft image on consolesandhigh hardware requirements on PC... whereasStarfielddidn't use all the tools that were available,arriving without DLSS or XeSS supportand with subpar performance on Nvidia and Intel graphics cards.NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 | New Ray Reconstruction Enhances Ray Tracing with AIHere's the initial DLSS 3.5 announcement video from Nvidia, featuring roundtable participant Bryan Catanzaro.Watch on YouTubeAs Bryan and Jacob go on to mention, the development of these sorts of technologies are all about being smarter with how you render each frame and while there can be differences in how effectively developers use the technologies available to them, the goal is to let both developers and end users attain a good balance of performance and fidelity.There's plenty more discussed than I have time to cover here - including the development of different DLSS versions, how denoising improvements impacted the development of Cyberpunk's art and more general musings about what machine learning could be used for in game graphics beyond DLSS 3.5.It's all fascinating stuff, so do check out the video embedded below. While there is a visual component, I found the talk also worked well as an audio-only podcast, so if you fancy an hour-long discussion to accompany you as you drive or do chores, you've got that option too.Thanks to Bryan, Jakub, Jacob and Pedro for joining us for this one, and of course stick with us for more on the graphics of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. We'll be taking a much closer look at DLSS 3.5's innovations as presented in the 2.0 version of Cyberpunk, and of course we'll be examining PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of the game in due course.","UPDATE: Digital Foundry has just completed its review of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 on PC, with a strong focus on the new ray tracing innovations added to the game in the form of DLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction.

198,Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways fresh footage shows Ada in action,"Resident Evil 4's brilliant Separate Ways campaign starring fan-favourite Ada Wong has now been confirmed for launch as DLC for Capcom's equally brilliant Resi 4 remake. And today, we can now bring you more of a look at what to expect.Looking at the brand new footage, Ada seems to play very similarly to Leon, with the new parry mechanic very much in action, R2 knife opportunities to silence downed enemies, and silent knife takedowns for unaware ganados. The big difference for Ada, however, is that she comes equipped with her trademark grappling gun for tackling enemies at a distance and reaching new locations. Using the grappling gun to initiate a melee attack in particular looks a lot of fun, and it's also worthwhile noting that it seems grappling to a distant location can be immediately followed up with a melee attack to nearby enemies upon landing.The grappling gun adds some much-needed spice to what would otherwise be a retread of familiar locations. It's really fun to see Ada zipping around Leon's old stomping grounds of the castle ramparts and the village outskirts. Keeping distance from enemies by whizzing from one tower to another and plugging them with bullets from afar seems just as viable as grappling them in the chest and zooming in for a brutal up close kick to the head. It's nice to see a tool that is believably useful for both traversal and combat, especially one that allows Ada to execute her literally every single move with pure style. If Leon is the internet's babygirl, then Ada is most definitely Mother.Resident Evil 4 Separate Ways - Resident Evil 4 DLC New Gameplay and Impressions! RE4 DLC gamplayEurogamer's Aoife Wilson takes a look at what Ada's been up to.Watch on YouTubeAda might help Leon out if it benefits her in the long run, but Ada is here on her own mission. As in the original Separate Ways, she's been employed by favourite Resident Evil bad guy Albert Wesker to retrieve something valuable and destroy anyone or anything that gets in her way, but also just like the original game Ada doesn't always play by Wesker's rules.There does seem to be a bit of a divergence from the story of the original DLC, however, in that at the end of the new Separate Ways trailer it's hinted that Ada has been infected with the virus, which didn't happen originally. We'll be interested to see how that changes up some of the events to come.Other new additions include requests like the ones seen in the main campaign of the remake. Ada too can destroy blue medallions for rewards.The gameplay section that perhaps had us most excited for the DLC features Ada facing off against El Gigante, swinging from rooftop to rooftop to keep out of harm’s way, before using the grappling gun to tumble through the air like Spider-Man, slashing and swinging around to get to the parasite on its back. If all the boss fights in the DLC are like this, sign us up right now.Resident Evil 4 Separate Ways - Launch TrailerResident Evil 4: Separate Ways launches on 21st September.Watch on YouTubeSo what else do we want to see from this Separate Ways reimagining? Well, a nice long runtime for one, and more time with some of the game's iconic characters. Ada will almost certainly be having to babysit Luis to some extent, and we're looking forward to seeing more interaction between those two. Getting a bit more Wesker screentime will be very interesting too - he featured more in the remake so it's possible we're gearing up to seeing him in an even bigger role in the DLC.Could either Luis or Wesker possibly be featured in a playable role? That would certainly be unexpected. But Wesker as a playable character becomes a slightly more viable theory when you factor in that both he and Ada will be be added to The Mercenaries mode, as part of a free update for the base game launching on the same day as Separate Ways, 21st September. While Separate Ways needs to be bought separately, Ada and Wesker's appearance in the Mercenaries mode is a free update.But back to Separate Ways. We'd love to see more Luis and just generally more interesting character moments. There has been some criticism of Ada's depiction in the main game, more specifically that her interactions with other characters have been quite flat and emotionless. Though you could say that her delivery is deliberate so as to keep everyone - Leon included - at arm's length, which makes sense for a double-crossing spy, it seemed a bit of a shame to lose Ada's turns at being sassy, flirty, funny, and sarcastic, with effortless quips in the original game all reasons why she's so many people's favourite character in the whole of the Resident Evil franchise. Maybe expanding her role in Separate Ways, showing her in more vulnerable moments, allowing her to let her guard down - especially if she's been infected - will mean we get to see more of the real Ada, and see her real personality shine through.More content we'd love to see includes encounters that were cut from the main game, such as the U3 boss fight. We saw in the gameplay footage provided to us that it looks like the second Verdugo is on Ada's trail so there will almost certainly be some sort of showdown there. Will she use her infected status to gain the trust of some individuals - maybe even big cheese Mendez - to infiltrate Illuminados ranks from the inside? Will we see another Krauser showdown? Obviously there are things that narratively Separate Ways simply has to do in order too line up with the events of the main game, but there are also some big gaps to be filled creatively, and hopefully Capcom takes the opportunity to do just that.","Resident Evil 4 's brilliant Separate Ways campaign starring fan-favourite Ada Wong has now been confirmed for launch as DLC for Capcom's equally brilliant Resi 4 remake.

199,Triple-A games are coming to iPhone 15 Pro - and the implications are mouthwatering,"Triple-A gaming on mobile phones? Up until now, the chances of it happening seemed vanishingly slight owing to the sheer range of hardware with a staggering breadth of horsepower and the correspondingly fragmented audience. Why attempt to port a game likeDeath Strandingto a phone if the vast majority of the audience can't run it? And do games like Death Stranding actually work as a mobile experience to begin with? We're about to find out, as last week's Apple keynote revealed two new iPhones - the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max - running games includingResident Evil 4,Resident Evil Village,Assassin's Creed Mirageand, yes, Death Stranding.Apple says this is all made possible owing to the new GPU found within its cutting-edge A17 Pro silicon - the first 3nm processor to hit a mainstream consumer device. That GPU supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing on top of a mooted 20 percent increase in general performance over its predecessor. The A17 Pro in general looks phenomenal, adding further CPU horsepower to its already market-leading performance, along with a larger, faster Neural Engine. Accelerated machine learning features? That'll be useful for the Metal FX upscaler, which we've already seen working on Mac, delivering results comparable with the market-leading Nvidia DLSS.Other features of the iPhone 15 Pro range also impress, with a 120Hz variable refresh rate display, HDR and a relatively manageable screen resolution. Combined with Metal FX upscaling, the A17 Pro should be able to deliver a good level of GPU horsepower per pixel while retaining excellent image quality. This topic is just one of a range of items covered in the new DF Direct Weekly, conveniently posted for your audiovisual enjoyment below.DF Direct Weekly #129: PS5 State of Play, Nintendo Direct, Starfield Patch Upgrades, iPhone 15 Pro!In addition to the iPhone 15 Pro talk, DF Direct Weekly #129 tackles last week's State of Play, Nintendo Direct and much more.Watch on YouTube0:00:00Introduction0:01:35News 01: Sony September State of Play0:37:42News 02: September Nintendo Direct0:49:58News 03: Starfield post-release update plans detailed!0:55:03News 04: Horizon Forbidden West to hit PC?0:59:04News 05: Immortals of Aveum patched, developer cuts staff1:07:16News 06: iPhone 15 Pro gets ray tracing support, big budget games1:15:16Supporter Q1: With compromised releases like Jedi: Survivor, don't publishers realize they are leaving sales on the table?

The good news is that as time progresses, those hardware requirements will gradually permeate down to lower-end, more affordable phones. The precedent is already there as the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are running the A16 Bionic from last year's iPhone 14 Pro flagship.In terms of the addressable market for developers, there's more good news here as it seems that the ecosystem that delivered Resident Evil Village on Mac makes for easier porting of Mac versions of games to iPhone. In being able to bring expensive-to-develop games to iPhone, developers and publishers also stand to benefit from an increasing market delivered by the continuing sales of higher-end Apple cellphones while also supporting the Mac platform. A more fully formed ecosystem is developing that suddenly makes development for all modern Apple devices a lot more appealing.Resident Evil Village on Mac Review: MetalFX Upscaling Challenges DLSS!We've looked at Resident Evil Village on Mac, an excellent showcase for Apple's Metal FX upscaling.Watch on YouTubeIn terms of consumer excitement about this announcement, I can only offer anecdotal evidence but certainly in terms of the questions posed by the Digital Foundry supporters for this week's DF Direct Weekly, it was by far the most popular topic. We had more questions about this announcement than we did about the PlayStation State of Play or the Nintendo Direct.The question is: can the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max deliver good experiences on higher-end games? Bearing in mind screen resolutions, Metal FX upscaling and the raw horsepower provided by the best-in-class Apple Silicon, I'd say the chances are good. The only potential fly in the ointment concernssustainedperformance. The longer a mobile processor runs at maximum power, the hotter it becomes, and as smartphones typically don't have active cooling, performance throttles back. The basic idea of putting a phone into a case in order to protect it doesn't exactly help with heat dissipation either.To see this content please enable targeting cookies.Manage cookie settingsI'm reminded of a conversation I had back in the day with Epic Games aboutFortniterunning on iPhone 10. The silicon had the performance to run the game at 60 frames per second - but it was capped at 30fps anyway, to save on battery life and to ensure that the phone didn't overheat. Only when faster, more efficient processors came along did Epic unlock the performance.According to IGN, frame-rate capping at 30fps is in effect on Resident Evil Village at least, and that makes sense.We're hoping to look at this new wave of games as and when they launch towards the end of this year and the beginning of the next, assuming we can get a decent video output feed from the hardware that doesn't compromise performance - but on a more general level, it would be fantastic to add a new platform to the range of hardware we cover at Digital Foundry.","Triple-A gaming on mobile phones?

Apple'snext software update will be iOS 18.3, or at least, that's what everyone expects right now. SinceiOS 18.2just came out, that would make sense. It should be noted that we don't know specifically when iOS 18.3 will launch or entirely what it will entail when it does come out. However, per9to5Mac, the x.3 update for each of the last three versions of iOS came out in late January, so expect iOS 18.3 to launch in late January, unless something weird happens. As for big new features coming to iOS 18.3, we really only know about one right now, and ""big"" might be a generous word to use for it: robot vacuum control. Specifically, you'll be able to use the Home app tocontrol robot vacuums, in the same way you can currently use the app to control smart home lights and other devices. The weird part is that Apple doesn't currently produce a robot vacuum of its own, but thatcould happen in the future. Everything else that's currently in the developer beta for iOS 18.3 fits under the umbrella of ""bug fixes and minor improvements,"" unfortunately. That doesn't mean there won't be bigger features eventually to be unveiled, but things like Apple Intelligence will probably need to wait until iOS 18.4, at the earliest.

208,Supposed expert reviews of Google Gemini outputs are coming from non-experts,"Like any genAI model,GoogleGeminiresponses can sometimes beinaccurate, but in this case it might be because testers don't have the expertise to fact-check them. According to TechCrunch, the firm hired to improve accuracy for Gemini is now making its testers evaluate responses even if they don't have the ""domain knowledge."" The report raises questions about the rigor and standards Google says it applies to testing Gemini for accuracy. In the ""Building responsibly"" section of the Gemini 2.0announcement, Google said it is ""working with trusted testers and external experts and performing extensive risk assessments and safety and assurance evaluations."" There's a reasonable focus on evaluating responses for sensitive and harmful content, but less attention is paid to responses that aren't necessarily dangerous but just inaccurate. Google seems to disregard the hallucination and error problem by simply adding a disclaimer that ""Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it,"" which effectively absolves it from any responsibility. But that doesn't account for the humans doing the work behind the scenes. Previously GlobalLogic, a subsidiary of Hitachi, instructed its prompt engineers and analysts to skip a Gemini response they didn't fully understand. ""If you do not have critical expertise (e.g. coding, math) to rate this prompt, please skip this task,"" said the guidelines viewed by the outlet. But last week, GlobalLogic changed its instructions, saying, ""You should not skip prompts that require specialized domain knowledge,"" and to instead ""rate the parts of the prompt you understand,"" and note that they don't have the required expertise in their analysis. Expertise, in other words, is not being treated as a prerequisite for this work. Contractors can now only skip prompts that are ""completely missing information,"" according to TechCrunch, or those that contain sensitive content that requires a consent form. TopicsArtificial IntelligenceGoogle",A firm hired to test Google Gemini for accuracy has reportedly changed its policy from letting analysts skip prompts outside of their expertise to evaluating them even if they don't fully understand the responses.,Mashable,https://mashable.com/article/google-gemini-testers-reportedly-forced-to-evaluate-responses-outside-of,

212,Hawk Tuah girl Haliey Welch has disappeared from public view after crypto rug pull,"Haliey Welch has gone MIA. The ""Hawk Tuah"" girl has not released a new episode of her popular weekly podcast, Talk Tuah, in two weeks. There was no previously announced hiatus of the show. Welch also has not posted on her social media channels in weeks either. Welch became aviral sensationover the summer after dropping what would go on to become her catchphrase ""Hawk Tuah"" in a video clip that spread across the internet like wildfire. Welch capitalized on her internet fame by selling merchandise like t-shirts and then eventually launching a weekly podcast called Talk Tuah, which rocketed to the top of the Spotify podcast charts. Everything appeared to be coming up roses for Welch. And then shelaunched her own cryptocurrency. She hasn't been heard from by the public since. On Dec. 4, Welchannouncedthat her Hawk Tuah memecoin, $HAWK, had gone live. The memecoin exploded in value, with a market cap in the hundreds of millions of dollars – before quicklycollapsing. Many who bought $HAWK had lost a significant sum of money in a matter of minutes. Welch's fans who had invested started to blame those directly involved in the project. Investigations into the memecoin found that the vast majority of the tokens were held by just a few wallets, with those that had invested claiming that insiders received pre-launch access to the cryptocurrency before it went on sale to the public. After it launched, some said, those insiders dumped $HAWK for a profit, leaving Welch's fans holding the bag. Welch and OverHere, the crypto team she partnered with, held a public Spaces stream on X, formerly known as Twitter. During the live audio chat, Welch and her partners were heavily criticized by listeners, including the popular YouTube crypto scam investigatorCoffeezilla. Before $HAWK holders could get any real answers about why $HAWK had crashed, Welch interrupted the stream. ""Hey guys!"" Welchsaidon the late night Dec. 5 stream. ""I hate to interrupt you, Nick, but hello there. Anywho, I'm gonna go to bed and I'll see you guys tomorrow."" And that was the last the public has heard from Welch since. While Welch has yet to make a statement, her partners at OverHere have recently attempted toaddress the situation. The group placed the blame on Alex Larson Schultz, also known as Doc Hollywood, who OverHere claims ""'controlled all token decisions, fees, treasury."" Schultz is a music producer, DJ, and crypto promoter who is best known to the public as comedian Howie Mandel's son-in-law. Schultz has yet to comment on OverHere's statement. Mashable attempted to reach out to Welch but has yet to hear back. The Talk Tuah podcast was launched on Sept. 3 and has released a new episode every week since. The last episode of Talk Tuah was released on Dec. 3, one day before the launch of $HAWK. Welch also has not posted on social media since the failed cryptocurrency launch on Dec. 4. However, we may hear from Welch or at least other members of her $HAWK team soon. Hawk Tuah memecoin investorsfiled a lawsuiton Thursday against the creators of $HAWK, alleging that they had unlawfully sold unregistered securities.

TheLenovo Yoga 9i (Gen 9)is the best 2-in-1 laptop we've tried, earning praise from our reviewer for its gorgeous 2.8K OLED touchscreen, its peppy (albeit piping-hot) CPU, and its clear Bowers & Wilkins soundbar. For a twist on the hybrid form factor, we also highly recommend the beautifulAsus Zenbook Duo. We've got additional picks for specialty users — theAlienware m16 R2is thebest gaming laptopwe've tested thus far, and theAcer Swift X 14is our go-to Windows laptop for photo and video editing. We've got several newer Windows laptops in hand for testing, including aDell XPS 13with an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processor and a tandem OLED display; the HP Omnibook Ultra Flip, which is a Lunar Lake convertible; and the upgradable, repairable Framework Laptop 13. We'll update this guide in the near future if we think any of them are worthy picks. Also, stay tuned for Mashable's coverage of theConsumer Electronics Show(CES), a massive tech trade show that goes down in early January. We expect lots of new and refreshed Windows laptops to come out of it. We recently finished trying theHP Omen 17, a 17-inch gaming laptop that retails for $1,799 as tested. Our reviewer appreciated its in-game and thermal performance, calling it ""more than capable of playing AAA titles at high settings with a smooth refresh rate and practically no retained heat."" However, its mediocre keyboard, speakers, and battery life hold it back. It's nice if you just want a powerhouse that doesn't cook your desk, but it's not well-rounded enough to be our top pick.

That's a 50% discount off the typical price of $599 and a savings of $299.01. Capable of cleaning both hard floors and carpet, the Shark AI Ultra works hard to keep your floors sparkling clean without being a bother. Shark employs the help of LiDAR vision to make an accurate map of your home's layout. Not only does this help the lil' robot make its way around your home to clean, it also gives you the ability to tell your robot to go vacuum the family room but avoid the kitchen, for example.

The match will take place at Notre Dame Stadium in Indiana on Friday, Dec. 20, and is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT. Indiana is 11-1 overall and 8-1 in the Big Ten Conference, but came in second in conference to the No. 1 overall team, the Oregon Ducks.

The highest ranked winner of a fifth conference will take the 12th seed, if the team is not ranked higher than 12.

220,The perks and pitfalls of hypervisible polyamorous breakups online,"The popularity ofpolyamory and other non-monogamyhas been on the rise in recent years, with some experts citing the first Trump election andCOVID-19 for challenging sexual and romantic norms. Regardless of the reasons why,dating appsandsearch engine trendstell us that non-monogamy is on our minds. For individuals known online by tens of thousands of people for being polyamorous, there can be some unique challenges to their relationships — especially when they end. Social media can be a blessing for any minority community, many of whom are desperate to see themselves represented and to find opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. But for those in the spotlight, their public persona adds a singular element to heartbreak. ""Some people have a weird entitlement towards content creators,"" says Michelle Hy (@PolyamorousWhileAsian), a Portland-based polyamory content creator. ""I've kept pretty good boundaries and rules when I post about a breakup or de-escalation — if it's amicable, I'll use it as an example in my stories or just to show that de-escalations can happen. If it's more tense than that, I won't talk about it publicly at all."" De-escalation is a term used in the polyamorous community to mean reducing the level of intimacy or commitment between partners, while still staying connected. For example, a couple who decides to stop living together but continue dating might describe that process as a de-escalation of their relationship. ""Sometimes people want to know who did what, which I understand, but can definitely feel invasive,"" says Hy. Hy's experience with prying eyes is echoed by other polyamory content creators. ""When I was grieving my breakup, people would comment things like, 'Aw, you guys were so cute, I'M grieving your breakup,' which kept me feeling kind of stuck,"" reports Gabrielle Alexa Noel (@gabalexa), a queer sex and polyamory educator. ""People expected a statement from me, my partner, and his other partner. We all ended up agreeing not to post about it to avoid having our opinions and experiences weaponized. But even still, a lot of people expected a story — with a beginning, middle, and neat, tidy end. That's just not real life."" While important for destigmatizing alternative lifestyles, social media also blurs the lines between the personal and the public. It's easy to forget that the people who share parts of their lives for the purpose of education and community are offering something very generous, often at some personal expense. ""We get used to some parts being public and forget that that's just the surface level. It looks cute on paper, and it is cute in real life too, of course,"" observes New York-based queer artist, Jonzu (@jonzu). ""But you're not always going to see the day-to-day work."" It's important to remember that social media can never capture the full nuances of anyone's life, but at its best, it can offer a slice of hope in the form of representation and shared joy. We already know thatwomen, people of color, and queer people experience disproportionate harassment online. Unsurprisingly, this is reflected in the experiences of polyamorous influencers as well. Hy, who specifically creates content about intersectional polyamory as a queer Asian woman, shares: ""I want to display more examples of diverse polyamory, and I definitely feel bummed that I can't do that without putting my loved ones at risk.""  Followers can become demanding about personal details and bring highparasocialexpectations for how influencers conduct their personal lives. Hy isn't the only polyamorous influencer facing these unrealistic expectations of unofficial ambassadorship. Followers can feel invested in the representation they want to see, forgetting that influencers are just living their lives. ""My ex is Black, and so am I, but none of my other partners are. After we broke up, I received overwhelming pressure online to date another Black person next,"" says Noel. ""I lean towards dating other people of color in general, but I don't want to be measuring my dating interactions based on public expectations!"" While influencers' fans can see their breakup and have opinions about their personal decisions, so do the haters. ""When we were breaking up, I remembered comments like, 'I'm just following to see this crash and burn' from people who hate polyamory. I never want them to think they were right!"" adds Noel. ""I have specific conversations with people from the beginning, even on early dates,"" says Noel. ""Like when we take a picture, if I post them and tag them, people might go to their page and interact. Sometimes 5,000+ people will click on my friends' profiles after we take a vacation together!"" While most of this engagement is harmless, it follows that higher visibility online creates a higher likelihood of harassment. ""My Puerto Rican partner of 4+ years experienced a lot of racial harassment, and it wasn't in response to anything in particular, just the existence of our relationship,"" Noel continues. ""That made her reticent to be tagged for a while. She's okay with it now, but it's something I realized I have to give new partners a heads up on."" Other influencers agree that there have to be intentional choices when deciding which parts of their personal life to make public and which parts to keep private. While there is value in vulnerability and visibility, finding the balance is a crucial part of these influencers' well-being. ""I didn't really post about breakups, but recently my published writing has become more personal. I wrote about my last breakup, but kept it pretty open-ended,"" says Jonzu. ""I keep names anonymous and I don't post photos of partners or friends,"" Hy agrees. ""Having a public page also makes me more careful about who I date in general — it has happened more than once on a first date that someone will say 'I follow you on Instagram' and I realize they automatically know a lot more about me than I know about them. In general, it makes me feel a lot more cautious than I was 5 years ago."" Despite this plethora of challenging experiences, it's a relief to know that our polyamorous content creators aren't going anywhere. ""I wouldn't be polyamorous without social media,"" says Noel. ""It's where I found helpful information, made connections, and knew what to expect at NYC polyamory events. Eventually, it opened doors for writing opportunities and the events that I host, which I find rewarding."" ""We booked some fun gigs — we were a power throuple!"" says Jonzu. ""It was a unique time for us to collaborate as queer artists and writers. It felt good at times being told that people look up to us for our dynamic.'""",Polyamorous content creators speak to Mashable about the perks and pitfalls of posting about their relationships and breakups.,Mashable,https://mashable.com/article/polyamorous-influencer-breakups,

237,Scientists find 2 stars thriving on the brink of a giant black hole,"Just on the outskirts ofa supermassive black holeroughly 4 million times more massive than the sun, a pair of stars locked in a dance is thriving. Astronomers discovered the duo orbitingSagittarius A*, the Milky Way galaxy's central supermassive black hole, using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. Thebinary system, the first ever found in the vicinity of an enormous black hole, is dubbed D9. Black holes are some of the most inscrutable phenomena inspace. They don't have surfaces, like a planet or star. Instead, they have a boundary called an ""event horizon,"" or a point of no return. If anything swoops too close,it will eventually fall in, never to escape. Thenew discovery, published inNature Communications, may help astronomers better understand how stars can survive in regions of the cosmos with extreme gravity. The finding also leads scientists to wonder whether such a pair, forming and coexisting near an enormous black hole, could also hostexoplanets. ""Black holes are not as destructive as we thought,"" said Florian Peißker, one of the researchers at the University of Cologne in Germany, ina statement. Black holes were little more thana theory 50 years ago— a kooky mathematical answer to a physics problem — but even astronomers at the top of their field weren't entirely convinced they existed. How thesupermassivekindform is even more elusive. Astrophysicists believe these invisible giants lurk at the center of virtually all galaxies. Hubble telescope observations havebolstered the theorythat they begin in the dusty cores of starburst galaxies, where new stars are rapidly assembled, but scientists are still teasing that out. Now black holes are getting their pictures taken by a collection of enormous, synced radio dishes on Earth. Humanity saw a clear view of the Milky Way's own central black hole, Sag A* for short, for the first time in 2022. It is about 26,000light-yearsaway from Earth. TheJames Webb Space Telescope, a collaboration ofNASAand the European and Canadian space agencies, is also doing its part to revealhow these mysterious behemoths formin the first place. The research team found D9 in a dense cluster of stars orbiting Sag A*. Within this group are so-called ""G objects,"" mysterious things that act like stars but look more like clouds of gas and dust. In their paper, the scientists propose that G objects might be a combination of other binary stars and leftover material from other pairs after they've merged, due to the strong gravitational clutch of the nearby black hole. That's right: Astronomers suspect the two stars in D9 will soon merge into a single star because of the close-by gravity. They are estimated to be only about 2.7 million years old — for comparison, thesunis 4.5 billion years old — and they'll likely only have another 1 million years or so before they ultimately smash. Though no one checked the D9 stars' driver's licenses for their ages, co-author Michal Zajaček, a researcher at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, said astronomers can tell the pair is young by the gas and dust around them. Other young stars, though not binaries, have been found in this region before.","Astronomers have discovered a first: a binary star system in the vicinity of Sagittarius A*, the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.",Mashable,https://mashable.com/article/binary-stars-black-hole-sagitarrius-a,

241,Hondas new 0 Series electric car prototypes go hard on the 80s future aesthetic,"Honda is about to reveal two new electric car prototypes, and judging by an early teaser, they'll look like something that came out ofBlade Runner. The company shared a teaser on X, showing silhouettes of two 0 Series EVs without revealing many other details. That one picture is not much to go on, we know. Honda's 0 Series ideas aren't a complete unknown, though — the company revealed the first 0 Series prototypes in January 2024, during this year'sCES. The two cars are (tentatively, we hope) called the Saloon and the Space Hub, with the first one being an elongated sedan, while the second is more of a family-hauling minivan. You can find out more about the currentprototypes here. As for the new prototypes, we'll learn more about them at CES 2025, as the company has scheduled an event for 10:30 a.m. PT on January 7. Honda will also tell us more about a new System on Chip as well as a proprietary vehicle operating system, which will run on the 0 Series cars. We'll also learn more about the company's new automated driving tech. All of these have to do with the ""wise"" bit in the company's 0 Series motto of ""Thin, Light, and Wise."" Honda plans to bring these cars to market in 2026, so the new prototypes are particularly interesting as they're being shown fairly close to launch. But there's currently no word on the rest of the cars' specs, such as battery, powertrain, and range. The news comes shortly after reports thatNissan and Hondaare in early talks to merge in order to strengthen their position in the EV market.

242,The Six Triple Eight review: Kerry Washington rescues Tyler Perrys war drama,"At a time when a vital public good like the U.S. Postal Servicecould be privatized, a film about going above and beyond to deliver mail ought to hit different(ly). Unfortunately,The Six Triple Eighthits the same as most sentimental dramas that treat war as a postcard. A story about an underestimated battalion delivering long-delayed mail to soldiers on the front lines, it's a decent watch with some intriguing historical tidbits about the United States' only World War II Army Corps made up predominantly of Black women: the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. However, when it comes to material requiring a deft dramatic hand, writer/director Tyler Perry rarely answers the call of duty. ThisNetflixoriginal also is (or rather, should be) a film about just how the the 6888th managed such a gargantuan achievement, but it seldom finds a balance between the ""what"" and the ""how"" of its own subject matter. IfThe Six Triple Eightexcels — and it seldom does — it's because of the movie's cast, who do their best to bring a sense of lived reality to the proceedings, if only to craft a lukewarm, passive experience for a couple of hours. You could throw on in the background this Christmas without too much fuss, though the women on screen might deserve better. That little ofThe Six Triple Eightunfolds on the front lines is a mercy. Its opening prologue, however, does, making war seem like a hoot, with cartoonish explosions right out of a Quentin Tarantino film, or the Italian war and Western movies that inspired him. Alas, pure entertainment is the last thing on Perry's mind in this scene (ironically set in Italy in 1943), which culminates in a pilot being shot down, and a bloody letter being retrieved from his pocket. The earnest drama then flashes back a year prior, to the blossoming Pennsylvania romance between young Black teenager Lena (Ebony Obsidian) and her white, Jewish boyfriend Abram (Gregg Sulkin), an interracial pair whose free-spirited frolic is looked upon with derision. Their broad, soap-opera dialogue suits the warm tones of this flashback setting, though this in turn steeps the film in a bizarre (if unintended) wistfulness. The opening text touts it as being based on the recollections of still-living battalion members, and this bright palette fits awkwardly with the many reminders of Jim Crow laws and socioeconomic segregation. Lena, for instance, works as a server at Abrams' going-away party before he's to be shipped out, and he asks her to wait for his return. However, news of Abram's demise months later hits her like a freight train, and propels her to enlist. The film never quite loses its nostalgic glow, even in moments the camera gazes upon with disgust, like when white soldiers openly admonish Lena and her fellow Black female cadets. The group she spends time with are a lively bunch, but it isn't until we meet their commanding officer, Major Charity Adams (Kerry Washington), thatThe Six Triple Eightgains a sense of weight and occasion, en route to its tale of their corps being tasked with sorting through a 10-month backlog of mail in Scotland. The variety of personalities in the movie's ensemble makes it mostly watchable. Obsidian, for instance, shows great care in her approach to Lena, whose grief prevents her from accepting the advances of a handsome soldier (Jay Reeves) or diving headfirst into the banter and camaraderie of her makeshift friend group. Among them are the voluptuous, foul-mouthed Southerner Johnnie Mae (Shanice Shantay) and the uptight preacher's daughter Elaine (Pepi Sonuga), whose friction is amusing. Meanwhile, mixed-race cadet Dolores (Sarah Jeffery) becomes a headstrong standout, for the kind support she offers. However, no matter how committed the cast is to their interpersonal dynamics, the writing seldom affords most of them the chance to expand beyond the broad archetypes with which they're saddled. In the process, they feel cordoned off from the movie's larger drama, and from the time period itself — which is where Major Adams comes in. As soon as Washington appears, she lights the screen ablaze with her poise and commitment. Immediately, she appears like the only actor who was allowed to explore the dramatic boundaries ofThe Six Triple Eight. It's a war film first and foremost, and while Adams' battalion never sees action, the character is locked in battle with larger forces from the moment we first glimpse her. It's a wonder the film wasn't entirely about Adams, whose story involves the delicate tightrope walk between holding back her anger towards white superiors who dismiss her and paving a path for women like herself to be treated as equals. The task of sorting through tens of thousands of letters (both to and from homesick infantrymen) comes her way as a challenge, courtesy of a side plot in which big-name actors show up for a scene or two. The movers of history, like President Franklin Roosevelt (Sam Waterston), First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (Susan Sarandon), and her friend and Black Cabinet leader Mary McLeod Bethune (Oprah Winfrey) have minutes of what feels like purely nominal screen time, as their characters set the wheels for the 6888th in motion. Their relatively minor roles help create the sense that these heavy hitters of the screen are ceding space for the younger cast. Of course, a story about racism would be incomplete without its racists, andBreaking Bad's Dean Norris makes for an especially detestable presence as General Halt, whose de facto purpose is throwing wrenches in Adams' operation. The movie never needs to offer an explanation for his actions, since the bitter indignance with which Norris carries Halt speaks for itself. Unfortunately, an aspect of its story the film could've been more overt about is its actual plot mechanics, i.e. the immense logistical operation the 6888th had to undertake. What makes a challenge cinematically interesting is seeing how it's overcome.The Six Triple Eightis primed for the kind of observations and montages that make films about complex undertakings — heists, journalism, or the inventing of Facebook — such a sensory delight. The film's leading women are quick to improve the material conditions with which they're saddled, via a slick montage of them cleaning and fixing up a bombed shelter as soon as they arrive in Europe. However, the same approach is rarely applied to them decoding, sorting through, and delivering letters to keep up morale. Several scenes and dialogue exchanges stress the importance of their task, from mothers and other relatives back home awaiting long-delayed communication, to Lena herself lamenting how little she heard from Abram while he was deployed. In fact, the film's central thesis on racist mistreatment boils down to how well (and how ingeniously) the women of 6888th can overcome the particular challenges of tracking down mail recipients from smudged addresses, or even clues as minor as fabric threads in family care packages. Whether or not they're capable of connecting loved ones becomes intrinsically tied to proving their worth. Unfortunately, they seem to solve these problems largely off-screen. Most of their methods don't even come to light until after they've been implemented and are being shown off to their white inspecting officers. It's nominally validating that they can prove naysayers wrong, but the joy of seeing how they do is robbed from the audience. Perry, though he seems to understand the strife his characters face, isn't as interested in cinematic pleasures as he is in gestures toward conquering bigotry and adversity. For instance, when Adams first reacts to the monumental piles of letters, stored in a hangar, that she and her troupe will have to sort through, the camera rightly stays affixed to her shocked expression. But the film never actually cuts to what she's looking at. It never affords the viewer the chance to experience Washington's gradual realization about the immensity of the mission before her. Even in a film about the eponymous squad, Perry keeps us at a distance from the rigors of their duties. This is, by and large, the movie's approach to all drama. It renders its audience as mere observers, rather than participants in its story. Despite the tremendous efforts of its cast, it leaves us to look upon the 6888th as artifacts of history, rather than real flesh-and-blood people with enormous hurdles thrown in their paths.

243,"Sleepmaxxing is TikToks latest wellness trend, but does it really work?","Off the back of astressful election cycle, an ongoingcost of living crisis, and winter cutting our sunshine short, anxiety and restlessness are common right now. So it's no surprise that the latest trend in wellness is all about scoring the perfect night'ssleep. It's been labelled ""sleepmaxxing."" With nearly125 million postson TikTok, sleepmaxxing is a catch-all rebranded term for maximising your sleep potential through all sorts of existing hacks ranging from the unusual to the eccentric, like wearingblue light glassesand weighted sleep masks,eating kiwis before bed, and evenpineal gland meditation— a breathing exercise that promises to put you to sleep in under 10 minutes. But does sleepmaxxing really work? I spoke to a sleep expert and a sworn sleepmaxxer to find out. ""Sleepmaxxing is a current social media trend for optimising sleep quality and quantity by focusing on (and obsessing!) about products, techniques and strategies to help you to get more restorative sleep,"" sleep expert and physiologistDr. Nerina Ramlakhantells Mashable. ""It's a growing viral trend because, although innately our physiology is perfectly designed to enable us to get good sleep, the way we are living our lives is very contrary to the way we are actually designed to live,"" she explains. Asurveyof 2,000 adults by Norwegian health site Helsestart found that more than one in five U.S. adults suffers from insomnia, a disorder that makes it difficult to fall or stay asleep, and a shocking 50 percent of adults experience insomnia once a month or more. Separately,research from the CDCin 2020 has found 14.5 percent of U.S. adults had trouble falling asleep, and nearly 18 percent had difficulty staying asleep. Online searches for ""insomnia symptoms"" are trending upward over the last five years, with notable peaks each January, according toGoogle Trends data. This sleeplessness phenomenon is a combination of factors keeping us awake at night, according to Ramlakhan: too much city light, mental stimulation, anxiety, fear, and — of course — unlimited access to our mobile phones and social media, resulting in a 24/7 online culture that makes it nearlyimpossible to disconnect before bedtime.And not everyone likes using dark mode. ""People are obsessed with getting a good night's sleep and are looking for solutions,"" said Ramlakhan. And that's where sleepmaxxing comes in — prioritising sleep through tech, luxury products, and unconventional lifestyle changes. There's an almost endless list of long-existing sleep hacks and techniques now trending as sleepmaxxing, including avoiding liquids for two hours before bed, using wearablesleep trackers, sipping herbal teas withmagnesiumormelatonin,light therapy lamps,special pillows,guided breathwork sleep companions,smart bed frames,noise machine apps,smart pyjamas,lettuce waterand more.Sleep stories are big businessfor mindfulness apps like Calm and Headspace, audio streamers like Spotify have whole Sleep sections, and there areentire podcastsdedicated to making you fall asleep. Perhaps the oddest of all sleepmaxxing methods involvesplacing skin sensitive tape over your mouth before sleeping. After hearing about the benefits of sleepmaxxing, Rachel Carrell, aged 44 in London, decided to try mouth taping because it's easy and cheap — though the science on the benefits of mouth taping is limited (more on that below), and you shouldcheck with your doctor before trying this. ""I have three kids and I run a childcare startup — I was exhausted all the time. I'm always looking for ways to optimise my sleep because I don't get very many hours,"" Carrell said. ""I decided to give mouth-taping a go. From one day to the next, I felt an incredible difference. I felt like there was this fire and energy inside of me that would last all day."" After forgetting to use mouth tape a couple of nights in the last several months, Carrell immediately felt a difference waking up the next day. ""I felt so groggy. I could instantly tell that I had forgotten to do it and so for me, it's been the most life-changing thing I've ever done."" A2022 studyfound that during sleep, mouth taping improved both snoring and sleep apnea amongst mouth breathers with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), though the sample size was low (20 patients). Anotherstudyof 30 mouth breathing patients with OSA found that their snoring and sleep improved when wearing a patch on their mouths. While Carrell has seen success with mouth taping, this is one anecdotal case. Some sleepmaxxing methods have been researched — somewhat, but remember, tech moves faster than regulation sohealth and wellness companies can make broad claims. A2021 studyon white noise found it improved sleep quality for people struggling to sleep with city noise.Researchhas also suggested a link between magnesium and sleep quality, as well asexposure to blue light, although there's more research needed to draw definitive conclusions on all these methods. ""There are definitely sleep aids and techniques that work,"" Ramlakhan says. ""Often sleep problems are created by underlying issues such as fear, anxiety, not feeling in control or safe in your body, past traumas or relationship challenges. While sleepmaxxing might help for a time, the deeper work lies in finding inner safety and settling the nervous system,"" she explained. ""I recommend magnesium glycinate [a supplement that increases your magnesium levels], white noise for those who wake at the slightest noise, having a simple fan in your bedroom, reducing exposure to blue light in the evening and I do believe that there can be some value in mouth taping,"" she said. Carrell hasn't experienced any side effects of sleepmaxxing and intends to mouth tape for the rest of her life. She's even noticed changes to her breathing patterns during other activities. ""Now when I walk up a steep hill, I don't have to puff through my mouth. I'm breathing more through my nose during exercise. I've even tried spin class with my mouth taped, just to see what happens,"" she said. There is a word of caution though, for anyone determined to optimise their sleep. ""While it is good and healthy to prioritise and value your sleep, there is the danger of becoming so obsessed with measuring your sleep, finding your next sleep aid and creating the 'perfect sleep' that this in itself creates anxiety about sleep — and ends up keeping you awake,"" warned Ramlakhan. And it's important to take aholistic view of your health, instead of zooming too far in on your sleep alone. ""The occasional poor sleep is normal and while sleep is really important, we also need to look at all of the other factors that impact our health, happiness, and energy levels: food, hydration, the way we breathe and move, our relationships, and doing things that bring us joy and purpose,"" she said. Yet when it comes to getting good quality sleep, it's often about what you don't do, rather than what you do. ""The biggest hindrance to getting good sleep is our obsession with our phones and in my extensive experience, there is no one product out there that can ameliorate the effects of constant usage of phones and our obsession with social media,"" said Ramlakhan. She shared her five top tips to truly sleepmax for a good night's sleep – no kiwis involved: Eat a nutrient rich breakfast everyday within 30-45 minutes of waking up. This helps to stabilise your blood sugar levels, reduces morning cortisol levels and alleviates anxiety, which are all important if you're experiencing sleep problems, according to Ramlakhan. Avoid caffeineand don't use it as a substitute for food. Hydrate for optimal brain function, including regulating your body temperature and to help produce sleep hormones like melatonin. Drink ideally 1.5 to 2 litres of water everyday. Get to bed earlier, ideally around 9.30pm. Read something relaxing, meditate or journal before falling asleep. Cultivate a healthier relationship with technology. Most crucially, don't keep your phone in your bedroom. Create an electronic sundown at least one hour before getting into bed and don't look at your phone during the night.

244,NASA performs extreme test on its moon spacecraft and releases footage,"NASA's preparing to put astronauts on its newmoon-bound spacecraft. Every system is being rigorously tested. Thespaceagency released footage of engineers assessing the Orion craft's essential launch abort system, wherein a cover must blast off the crew capsule before parachutes deploy.NASAalso tested Orion's response to lighting strikes and other extreme abort conditions at its Neil Armstrong Test Facility in Ohio. ""These tests are absolutely critical because we have to complete all of these tests to say the spacecraft design is safe and we’re ready to fly a crew for the first time on Artemis II,"" Michael See, a manager for the Orion Program, said in a statement. Artemis II, scheduled for April 2026, will send four astronauts on a voyage around themoon. They won't, however, land on the chalky lunar surface — that'll happen during Artemis III, set for mid-2027. During Orion's launch to space, if an anomaly or emergency occurs, the craft may have to rapidly propel away from theSpace Launch System rocket. Such launch aborts aren't common, but they do happen: In 2018, a Soyuz rocket's emergency abort systemblasted the crew capsuleaway from the damaged rocket, likely saving the lives of NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. The slow-motion view below, posted on X, shows the last part of Orion that must eject (called the forward bay cover) before the spacecraft's parachutes can open. An abort is an intense event. ""This event would be the maximum stress and highest load that any of the systems would see,"" said Robert Overy, the Orion Environmental Test Article project manager. ""We’re taking a proven vehicle from a successful flight and pushing it to its limits. The safety of the astronaut crew depends on this test campaign."" This energetic test occurred inside the Armstrong Test Facility, built with a simulation chamber that can fit full-sized spacecraft. ""The facility is unique because there’s no other place in the world capable of testing spacecraft like this,"" Overy explained. When astronauts do eventually land on the moon later this decade, they'll land in themoon's south poleregion, a place where the sun barely rises over the lunar hills. It's a world of profoundly long shadows and dim environs. One of the primary missions, over the course of a week, will be to look for invaluablewater iceand collect surface samples to bring back toEarth.

After six seasons, the documentary crew ofWhat We Do in the Shadowsis packing up their gear and wrapping production on the location in Staten Island where a houseful of vampires have frolicked, fucked, and sucked blood for ages. And if you're not ready to say goodbye, well, you're not alone. Human familiar turned bodyguard turned fledgling vampire turned non-vampire Guillermo (Harvey Guillén) is having a breakdown about the news of this conclusion. Maybe he worries the confessionals will rob him of the one place he felt safe to vent his frustrations about his dunderheaded master Nandor (Kayvan Novak), the lascivious Laszlo (Matt Berry), the wrathful Nadja (Natasia Demetriou), and the gleefully boring Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch). But more than that, maybe he worries that this ending means closing the book on his time with the vampires. Well, the vampires aren't worried. But not for the sentimental reasons of their human companion. In this finale, each beguiling bloodsucker will get one last moment to shine as bright as the moon, flashing their strengths and their insecurities with equal magnificence.

One of ourfavorite horror films of 2024, Tilman Singer's movie about a teenager being stalked by a stranger in the mountains was described by Siddhant Adlakha as ""a fun midnight genre romp that works despite its goofiest elements"" in hisMashable review. ""A mountainous horror film reminiscent ofThe Shining— albeit with far more overt body horror — it follows the travails of a family of four as they take up residence near a fancy lodge in an isolated corner of the German Alps,"" he wrote. ""When strange sounds emanating from nearby forests begin to have bizarre bodily effects on some of the guests, moody 17-year-old Gretchen (Hunter Schafer ofEuphoria) ends up stumbling upon an ongoing investigation into something both silly and sinister. With its tightly wound atmosphere and an impeccable ensemble that throws everything at the wall,Cuckooemerges as a largely unique work despite its many familiar elements, thanks in part to its increasingly twisted implications surrounding gender and biology. It's incredibly strange and deviously fun.""*— Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor Starring:Hunter Schafer, Jan Bluthardt, Marton Csokas, Jessica Henwick, and Dan Stevens How to watch:Cuckoois now streaming on Hulu. 22 years after they played mother and son in the charming British comedyAbout a Boy,Toni Collette and Nicolas Hoult face off in the Clint Eastwood-directed courtroom dramaJuror No. 2.He stars as Justin Kemp, a model citizen, family man, and journalist, who turns up for jury duty with an open mind and an eye toward justice. A hard-nosed prosecutor (Collette) believes she has the accused murderer pegged, beyond a reasonable doubt. But when Justin realizes he's had a part to play in this case, the paths of right and wrong become much harder to navigate.

Inhis review for Mashable, Siddhant Adlakha cheered, ""Clint Eastwood paintsJuror #2with subtle, masterful brush strokes,"" adding, ""Deep-seated symbols and ideas become fluid, making space for captivating drama that both pays homage and paves its own path: a constant tussle between old and new.""

In a star-making turn, Mikey Madison (Scream 5) stars as a sex worker whose professional relationship with a young Russian client swiftly swings into a quickie wedding in Vegas.

246,The Last Showgirl review: Pamela Anderson leads a shattering ensemble as an aging burlesque entertainer,"Gia Coppola'sThe Last Showgirlis a spellbinding film about aging, made with tremendous texture and soul. The wistful Vegas drama follows a fifty-something burlesque dancer in her career twilight, played by '90s sex symbol Pamela Anderson — her ostensible comeback role. It's one of just several strokes of smart meta-textual casting, resulting in an ensemble that grounds the movie's visual chaos in distinctly human melodies. At a mere 85 minutes in length, it zips by in the blink of an eye. However, it remains so captivating that by the time the credits roll, the film practically embodies the sensation of looking back at one's life and wondering where all that time went. It's a story steeped in regret, but one that reckons with past mistakes as a common, perhaps even necessary experience, especially the life of an artist. The Last Showgirlopens on Shelly (Anderson) about to audition with a provocative dance routine, as she lowers the brim of her bedazzled police hat and lies about her age (she claims to be 36). The camera remains tethered to her hesitant expression, awash in spotlight and surrounded by the darkness of an empty stage as though she were unmoored from time and space, and up against not just some phantom director but the entire world. When and where this brief framing scene occurs is irrelevant, at least at first. It comes back around eventually, but here, it serves as a gateway into the character's dueling self-doubt and persistence before the movie begins in earnest. The movie's world — its chintzy glitz and glamor — comes pouring through the screen all at once as we enter Shelly's daily routine in a lengthy, propulsive take backstage at her nightly job as a showgirl, at the low-rent Vegas revueLe Razzle Dazzle. She and several younger dancers pour in and out of their collective dressing room to make quick costume changes. It's brisk but humdrum, a mechanical energy the movie immediately punctuates with overlapping dialogue that gets lost in the shuffle. Much of it, however, is delivered by Shelly. During scenes like these, Shelly either complains, reminisces, or rambles, and is looked upon by her novice peers with both adoration and saintly patience. They love her. They put up with her. She's a mother figure who's been at this job since the '80s, so she knows the ropes, but she has an inflated opinion of what she does — or at least, that's how she frames it to other people, if only to convince herself that her lifelong sacrifices have been worthwhile. After hours (which is to say, during the day), she usually catches up with her work friends, including former burlesque co-dancer Annette (Jamie Lee Curtis), now a waitress at a casino. During one fine off-the-clock hangout, she's joined by two of the younger showgirls, Mary-Anne (Brenda Song) and Jodie (Kiernan Shipka), as well asLe Razzle Dazzle's curt stage manager Eddie (Dave Bautista), who comes bearing bad news about the revue's future. This gathering not only illuminates the ensemble's delightful interpersonal dynamics, but it creates a domino effect through which we, the audience, learn more about each character as the film goes on, since they're forced to reckon with their respective prospects. In the case of Shelly, she decides to check up on her estranged daughter, Hannah (Billie Lourd), a fraught relationship whose fissures seem to grow deeper each time the mother-daughter duo interacts. With the show's closure looming, the characters' pasts and futures begin to fade into focus. It essentially becomes a point of crisis, given how the revue (and their collective camaraderie) have formed a fragile new normal for them to take shelter from whatever they're each escaping. With that normalcy threatened, they're left with little choice but to reflect on what their lives might become without this temporary safety net, leading to a filmwhose plot is unmoving on paper, but whose underlying anxieties and ruminations are gently expressed through the dazzling aesthetic flourishes, as Coppola presents alluring portraits of women at pivotal moments in their careers. After her middling debutPalo Altoand her disastrous sophomore effortMainstream, Gia Coppola has levelled up withThe Last Showgirlin a way few American directors have — at least not since her grandfather followed upFinian's Rainbowwith acclaimed New Hollywood breakthroughThe Rain People, and soon after, withThe Godfather. The film is immediately captivating, thanks in no small part toLokicinematographer (and longtime Gia Coppola collaborator) Autumn Durald Arkapaw, whose images aren't just sensational but sensory, weaving thoughts, dreams, and memories into the frame's very shape and texture. The movie's use of 16mm celluloid yields film grain that dances, especially in low-lit interiors and against the backdrop of Vegas' bright neon signs, making the movie feel alive whenever the characters are captured in close quarters. The flaws in the film stock don't just feel like artifacts but gemstones, akin to the ones sewn into the showgirls' clothes. It’s as if they were at one with the picture, or we were viewing them not as objects on the other side of a lens but as elements within the lens itself, bringing them closer to our gaze. Coppola makes the intriguing story decision to omit the characters' actual dance performances for much of the runtime. In seldom revealing them on screen, she prevents the casting of judgement (by the camera, or by the audience) on what they do until she can ensure just the right circumstances in which to present them on stage — the right emotional context, once the movie's drama has dispensed with every possible argument about whatLe Razzle Dazzleis or isn't. Is it a job between jobs? A cheap nudie show? Or something refined, descended from Parisian artistic tradition? It depends on who you ask — Shelly believes it's the latter — but all these opinions and more end up colliding when the show is finally revealed, and ""what"" it is pales in comparison to what it means to each dancer. In the meantime, the frame dances and sways to capture their movements through cramped spaces like narrow backstage corridors and solo rehearsals, but this isn't just achieved through the camera's physical motion. The lenses themselves — anamorphicUltra Panatar— curve the plane of focus, warping and wobbling as the camera pans. They provide distinct blurs around the edges of the frame, not unlike the painterly flourishes Roger Deakins brought to the modern WesternThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Here, Coppola's Wild West is the heightened cultural un-reality of the Las Vegas strip with its fake Eiffel Towers and the like. It's the last frontier of possibility, after which it feels like someone can travel (or fall) no further. No matter where the characters turn for help — be it financial or emotional — they're all up against a wall, just as the idealism of showbiz cast in the city's bright lights is constantly confronted by its façade. These dueling realities and artificialities are also embodied by the movie's impeccable cast, on multiple narrative levels. The actors deliver immensely thoughtful work, and Coppola, in casting each performer in their respective parts, pulls something fundamental from them too, using their star power to magnify her narrative tenfold. Anderson, having once been a near-ubiquitous celebrity, feels like the most overt and obvious of the movie's tongue-in-cheek casting choices, but this doesn't mean she's ineffective. On the contrary. Her life as a woman in the spotlight, someone who's been both elevated and embarrassed by it, seems to inform her relationship to the camera, and  how much she opens up and closes herself off to it at any given moment. But make no mistake: This isn't a case of Anderson playing a version of herself. Shelly is a richly formed, often rankled, frazzled character, whose constant verbal diarrhea may as well be a symptom of insecurity. This year,The Substancewas lauded for its depictions of aging women in entertainment, and while its various genre metaphors were too scattered to be coherent, Demi Moore's role (and her private, vulnerable moments) left an impact. For instance, the moment in which Moore's character furiously wipes off her lipstick before a date and decides to stay home. Anderson belongs in that same conversation, for the sustained manner in which she lives in that exact mode of self-loathing, constantly on the precipice of breakdown. What's more, upon crossing that threshold, Shelly's vulnerabilities are distinctly ugly. Her breakdowns make her deeply unpleasant to those around her, especially her friends, making Anderson's performance all the more stunning in its honesty. Each supporting character is cast with a similar eye for real-world experience too. Curtis, a long-time entertainer and""final girl"" progenitor— once defined by her youthful innocence — found recent Oscar success as a wildly different character inEverything Everywhere All At Once: a frumpy, pouty old woman who couldn't seem to find happiness. And yet, in nailing that role, she appears to have found a comfortable new niche, making her appearance here as someone who has escaped the life of a showgirl feel oddly radical, if only because she plays a woman who, on some level, misses being the center of attention. Does being a cocktail waitress come with more dignity? Perhaps on occasion, but she still lives and works at the mercy of a misogynistic Vergas entertainment industry that can — and in the movie's case, does — turn on her on a dime. Coppola similarly casts former child stars Song and Shipka (ofThe Suite Life of Zack & CodyandMad Menfame, respectively) as young performers whose bodies are constantly on full display. Song's character, Mary-Anne, is a mediator of sorts, and often tells things like it is whenever Shelly rambles too long, while Shipka's Jodie is much more of a quiet observer, though in her own vulnerable moments, she feels (and fears) quite deeply. Both end up at the mercy of how interchangeably and disposable they're viewed by the world of live entertainment. Jodie especially feels the isolating brunt of being a young entertainer, in her subplot of being rejected by loved ones and searching for a maternal substitute in Shelly. Shelly, meanwhile, is preoccupied with trying to win back Hannah, whose bitter rejections pierce and hurt Shelly's sense of self and femininity. Hannah looks down on what her mother does, but her anger comes from a place of abandonment. For Lourd, whose own mother was a huge part of show business — Carrie Fisher ofStar Warsfame — being the daughter of an entertainer and struggling to comprehend both her mother's desires and her sacrifices feels equally charming and challenging, a wink at the audience that also pushes the actress to uncomfortably bitter places with her accusations. However, perhaps the movie's sharpest commentary alongside casting Anderson is Bautista's role as Eddie, the awkward, soft-spoken producer with a flowing mane; he looks out for Shelly and the other showgirls, though he's separated from them socially and structurally. He's afforded relative safety despite the show's potential closure, the way people in more traditional jobs might be (compared to most entertainers), and as a man, he isn't necessarily exposed to the same rigorous judgements as his female counterparts. Eddie is someone who seems to quietly understand all this, despite occasionally putting his foot in his mouth. Bautista brings not only an engaged thoughtfulness to the role, through sensitive eyes that seem to want to reach out to those in pain, but he brings the baggage of his past life as a wrestler too, a former WWE headliner whose own body (and bodily changes) have been the topic of media conversation. Having similarly had a physically demanding job with an expiration date — and one with all the camp and showiness ofLe Razzle Dazzle— simply placing the actor in this environment creates a relationship to it for the audience, one Bautista seizes upon through stray and wordless glances. As all these warring perspectives collide, Shelly is pushed slowly over the brink, as Anderson portrays a woman outliving her perceived usefulness — as a mother, as a friend, and as a physical entertainer whose youth and agility are paramount. The moreThe Last Showgirlgoes on, the more it feels like she's been covering up deep wounds with constant, nonsensical conversation, to the point that she can no longer honestly express herself without exploding. It's a masterclass in naturalistic performance, as Anderson dives into some of the heaviest emotional material of any actress this year — perhaps alongside Marianne Jean-Baptiste inHard Truths— creating meaning out of lifelong pain, while teetering on the edge of obsolescence. The Last Showgirlopens Dec. 13 in Los Angeles, and nationwide Jan. 10.

There's nary a phone or a mention of DNA samples in sight, but there is still hardboiled case-cracking — with plenty of atmosphere and historical intrigue to boot."" Set in Tudor England during the dissolution of the monasteries, the series sees Arthur Hughes (The Innocents) as titular barrister Matthew Shardlake, who lives with scoliosis and all the 16th century abuse that comes with it. He's ordered by Thomas Cromwell (the illustrious Sean Bean), the king's right hand, to investigate the murder of an emissary in the church of Saint Donatus, Scarnsea — where the monks are a little shady and politics is embedded in the very foundations. Anthony Boyle joins Hughes as Shardlake's trusty (and handsome) sidekick Jack Barak, and this odd couple of detectives form the true heart of the show.— Shannon Connellan, UK Editor How to watch:Shardlakeis now streaming on Disney+.

Wait, what? That's Rhiannon (Ella Purnell,Yellowjackets,Arcane,Fallout), an administrative assistant at a local newspaper who's blatantly dismissed by the people in her life — her boss basically uses her as a coat rack, and her high school bully (Sense8's Nicôle Lecky) continues to make her life hell in adulthood. When Rhiannon loses her one champion, her father, and her life gets turned upside down, she reaches boiling point — and that list of people she'd like to kill becomes pretty doable. Purnell is superb, as Rhiannon initially seems to want the ground to swallow her up in scenes where others steal the air from the room, before turning that fear into murderous rage, relishing in her newfound empowerment. ""By actually being comfortable with herself, looking in the mirror and being okay with what she sees, with being messy and breaking the rules, that allows her the confidence that she's been looking for,""Purnell told journalist Hanna Flint for Mashable.""No one over here is endorsing murder [but] watching a woman learn how to stand up for herself especially when she's gone through so much and been treated so badly, it feels good.""

Jack Rooke’sBig Boysreturned for a second season this year, solidifying itself as one of the simultaneously sharpest and sweetest comedies on TV. Season 1 was a riotous introduction to these wonderful characters — Jack (Dylan Llewellyn,Derry Girls), Danny (Jon Pointing,Sweetpea), Corinne (Izuka Hoyle,Boiling Point), and Yemi (Olisa Odele,It's a Sin) — whereas Season 2 moves them all into the bunker together for a second year at Brent Uni.

Why on Earth didMy Lady Janeget the cancellation curse? Gemma Burgess' flamboyant adaptation of Jodi Meadows, Brodi Ashton, and Cynthia Hand's novel series was binned by Amazon after just one season, despite being one of the best British TV shows of the year. The revisionist historical fantasy series sees Emily Bader in the revered role of Lady Jane Grey, England's ""Nine Days' Queen,"" a 17-year-old Protestant crowned after the death of her cousin Edward VI to stop a Catholic ascension, then executed at the Tower of London for treason. Taking history as a comment, this series takes magical liberties with the facts — mainly, that humans are able to transform into animals, known as Ethians, and they're deemed outsiders to humans without such a skill, known as Verity. ""This fantastical take on the much-less-fun conflict between Protestants and Catholics that raged in England at the time sets up a tense political divide,""writes Meg Walters in her review for Mashable.Stacked with a great cast — Rob Brydon, Jim Broadbent, Anna Chancellor, Dominic Cooper, Edward Bluemel, Máiréad Tyers, Jordan Peters, and more —My Lady Janerewrites history, ditching Lady Jane's oft-woven ""damsel in distress"" tale in favour of a fierce heroine at the centre of lusty politics.

Not only do we get new high-profile characters (played by the likes ofGame of Thrones' Kit Harington andBarry's Sarah Goldberg), we also get flashbacks,drug-induced visions,solo character episodes, and references to everything fromUncut Gemsto period dramas.

258,The very best digital gifts and subscriptions you can send via email,"There are two kinds of people in this world: Those who get all their holiday shopping done in November, and those who wait until the very last minute. If you fall into the latter category, there's a loophole that'll not only hide the fact that you're a procrastinator (which happens to the best of us) but will also guarantee that your giftee gets something they actually want or need. We're talking about digital gifts and subscriptions. Sure, knowing how to give a good virtualgift— good as in more personal than a Visa gift card — is basically an art form. But with this gift guide, you'll find we've rounded up a gift that'll fit the bill for just about anyone on your list, from family and friends to coworkers to lovers and everyone in between. Each of the following gifts is delivered online or with a recurring delivery to their door, so you don't have to worry about shipping costs or delivery times. No one is gonna turn down new stuff to watch. If you're gifting to someone who already has the go-to's likeNetflix,Hulu, andDisney+, consider other cable alternatives: Paramount+ (Paramount+ Essentialstarts at $7.99/month):Paramount+ is the go-to place for nostalgic Nickelodeon shows, reality icons likeRuPaul's Drag RaceandLove Island US, plus access to live sports. Paramount+ also offers a SHOWTIME subscription (Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) for $12.99/month. Max (starts at $9.99/month):Max is home to HBO originals likeHouse of the DragonandThe White Lotusand non-HBO content likeAbbott ElementaryandFriends. It's also the streaming service that many new movies hit first when they come out. Shudder (starts at $5.99/month):Horror junkies who have already tackled Netflix's hit-or-miss collection will dig Shudder's massive library of (actually good) scary moviesonly. Aside from a few classics likeHellraiser, a big chunk of the lineup is made up of films that probably weren't in theaters — but that blow mainstream disappointments out of the water.Mashable's Sam Haysomhas some suggestions. Walmart's Amazon Prime competitor might be a wiser choice for your friends who makewaytoo many trips to Walmart each week. It's another ""free shipping"" situation, but with no order minimums — and for just $12.95/month. Other perks include fuel discounts, early access to deals during major sales like Black Friday, and a bonus Paramount+ Essential subscription worth $59.99/year on its own. Plant parents could use a babysitter sometimes — whether they're nurturing their first plant ever or taking a stab at a feisty orchid. A paid Planta subscription ($9.99/month) goes past watering reminders: The app recruits their phone's camera to diagnose sick plants and make suggestions based on the amount of light in the room. Planta Premium also offers fertilizing, misting, repotting, and pruning help. Milk Bar's multi-tiered confetti cakes are definitely prettier than any of us, but that's what makes them such an iconic long-distance birthday gift. Loved ones with an eye for aesthetically pleasing foods would also appreciate a just-because tin of Milk Bar cookies or truffles. Prices range from $27 to $161 plus delivery fees. Gluten-free options are available. Picture this: Falling asleep to ASMR or a binaural beats playlist *without* being jolted out of a trance by an ad. For $13.99/month, YouTube Premium bars ads and continues playback when the YouTube app is closed. YouTube shares membership fees with content creators who otherwise profit from viewers watching ads. Flowers as a last-minute or long-distance gift is only cliché if you let it be. The online flower delivery service UrbanStems puts a modern twist on its floral arrangements with thoughtfully chosen color schemes and vases outside the traditional glass. The bouquets blow away anything you could find in the flower section at Whole Foods, and subscription prices start at $60 per delivery. You can choose weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. If your loved one always talks about mastering a particular skill, there's probably a MasterClass course for it. MasterClass doesn't offer just any online courses — they'll be coached by, well, famous people. Annie Leibovitz teaches photography, Jane Goodall teaches conservation, Gordon Ramsey teaches cooking, and more. With a subscription starting at $10/month, your loved one can choose from more than 200 instructors, with new classes added every month. On the rare occasion that they get tired ofMario Kart, anything from Jackbox is going to be a good-ass time. Jackbox's on-screen games are played on a phone app and are perfect for long-distance Zoom hangs. (Only one person has to have a Jackbox account. The others just have to download the app and enter the room code). Priced at $24.99 to $29.99, each Party Pack comes with four to five super unique games that really make you think — and confirm the funniest person in the group. Perfect for the Urban Outfitters, Free People, and Anthropologie stans,Nuulyis a $98/month service that offers rental pieces from sweaters to dresses to jeans (from the aforementioned brands and more). If they end up loving one of their rental items, they can buy it.Rent the RunwayandStitchFixoffer similar deals, but StitchFix has a $20 styling fee per order and only gives you three days to decide whether to buy the clothes. If you're looking for a kids' gift that's notMoanaor Marvel, consider CodeSpark Academy, which stars cute, memorable monster characters called The Foos. Parents will love it because it's educational: It teaches coding through challenges that require kids to devise their own chain reactions. For kids, though, it's just fun. Gift memberships start at six months for $59.99 ($9.99/month), but 12-month and lifetime subscriptions are available. Greeting cards may be a ""duh"" gift, but are heartwarming nevertheless.Punchbowl's selection probably blows that of your local CVS out of the water, and it offers myriad customization options — you can even throw in a gift card from stores like Amazon, Target, Disney, and Sephora. Cards can be sent to multiple recipients for free, but removing ads or scheduling a date requires a paid membership. Know a fitness obsessive or self-care fanatic who wants to shake up their routine? Enter: ClassPass, a wellness subscription service for dabbling in different studio classes, gyms, and spa/beauty treatments. Plans start at $19/month for eight credits they can put toward boxing sessions, yoga classes, facials, massages, manicures, and more. A free year of multiplayer gaming and access to online gaming catalogs is a great gift for anyone with any console.PlayStation Plus Essentialis $79.99 annually (with a bonus Sony movie credit), and you can getXbox Game Pass Corefor $9.99/month. For Switch players, a $19.99 yearlyNintendo Switch Onlineindividual membership will let them playMario Partywith friends and dip into a library of classic games. Getting groceries can bethe absolute worst thing when you're already tired or stressed out. Instead of dealing with long lines, missing items, or people breathing too closely as you reach for the last roll of paper towels, why not gift your loved ones an Instacart+ subscription? They can skip the grocery run and have their groceries delivered right to their doorstep in as fast as 30 minutes. Their membership includes free delivery on orders over $35, plus extras like Peacock Premium (worth $79.99/year) and aNew York TimesCooking subscription (worth $50/year). One doesn't have to be a graphic designer to get a ton of use out of Photoshop — it's a must-have software for anyone with a creative side. Folks in marketing can make ads and cool emails, aspiring photographers can learn layering and blending, or anyone who draws in their free time could bump things up to animation. Prices start at $9.99/month for Lightroom and Adobe Express, and go up to $59.99/month for the full Creative Cloud suite. Learning a new language in adulthood isn't off the table just because you can't remember a thing from high school Spanish. Rosetta Stone is one of the OG language-learning services, known for its deep dive into accent pronunciation, culture, andnotpressuring you like theDuolingo owl. Plans start at $239.40 for 12 months of access to a single language — good for a giftee who's planning a trip abroad. Know someone who thinks in long form? They need Scrivener. It's like a hybrid of Microsoft Word and a notes app like Evernote, aimed specifically at writers organizing large projects like novels, screenplays, or research papers. Different templates and tools for honing in on chunks of writing make it easy to organize thoughts. A standard license will run you $59.99. Trying new recipes is fun. Planning one of those recipes when you're dead tired after work is not fun. Meal boxes from services likeDinnerlyandBlue Apronallow you to customize meals online and receive pre-portioned ingredients for those meals right to your door. Meals can be tweaked depending on dietary restrictions (like gluten-free or vegan) and how many people are eating. Although subscription prices vary on portion sizes, they're way better than what grocery stores charge nowadays. Other meal kit options includeHelloFresh,Purple Carrot(for plant-based meals), andSplendid Spoon. Peopleloveto say they don't want to pay for Tidal on top of Spotify or Apple Music — and then they complain that theyreallywish they could listen toPrince's posthumous album. While Tidal used to be big for exclusive albums from Beyoncé and Jay-Z, it's now the go-to for audiophiles thanks to its glorious hi-fi streaming. Individual subscriptions go for $10.99/month. The idea of using clues to escape afakelocked room within a time limit is fun. The knowledge that there are multiple horror movies based on getting stuck in one? Not so much. Best of Cratejoy winner Escape the Crate brings the problem-solving adrenaline of an escape room to their home. Boxes start at $26.50 apiece; each one is filled with a set of themed puzzles and riddles that one to six people can complete in a couple of hours. If their relationship to makeup is like Ron Swanson's to tools, opt for Birchbox. If they're interested in beauty but have never been inside a Sephora, go forBirchbox, too. Boxes start as low as $22/month, but if they'd prefer to pick out their own stuff, a Birchbox gift card still gives them access to way more makeup than they'd find in a store. Plus, Birchbox frequently offers discounts on premium brands that Ulta and Sephora rarely discount. FabFitFun is like having a birthday four times a year. Once every three months, eight to 10 full-sized products arrive at your door, and it'sreallynice stuff. The variety is impressive: Boxes could contain anything from hair and makeup products to exercise gear to blankets and other cozy items. A gift card can be applied to a box ($69.99/each or $219.99/year), member-exclusive sales, or single purchases directly from the website. Meditation apps have become an increasingly popular way to de-stress, sleep better, and get a better grasp on mindfulness in general. Headspace has hundreds of guided meditations anchored toward everything from stress and anxiety to productivity and exercise, providing an excuse for much-needed breaks throughout the day to get back into the rightheadspace. Gift a three-month subscription for $38.99 or $69.99 for one year. You can think of Craftsy as MasterClass for people who could spend three hours in Hobby Lobby. Its Premium subscription tier unlocks over 2,000 expert-taught video classes on everything from embroidery to sourdough baking, plus a huge pattern library. Gift a membership for $10.25/month or $113 for the whole year. Keeping kids busy for a Saturday can be a task, let alone for a whole winter or summer break. Kid-friendly subscription boxes pick up where TV leaves off, offering hours worth of hands-on activities to do alone or with parents each month. Our favorites include learning about other countries withLittle Passportsor making math and science fun withKiwiCo. The quest for effective, natural household products shouldn't require a trip to some expensive specialty shop. Grove Collaborative has one of the best online selections of eco-friendly cleaning, baby, pet, and bath brands like Mrs. Meyers and hello. You don'thaveto subscribe to shop here, but VIP members get free shipping on orders over $29, exclusive discounts, early access to new products and deals, and seven free gifts for just $29.99/year.

Paying $14.95/month will get your gift recipient one monthly credit for a full audiobook they can keep forever, plus access to thousands of other titles and podcasts. Some books are read by well-known talent like Michelle Obama and Jonathan Van Ness. (And others by professional audiobook narrators who have their own fandoms, such asJulia Whelan.) Being in a book club with strangers across the country is a bookworm's dream. That's essentially what Book of the Month is: The company's judges (which include up-and-coming authors themselves) feature five must-reads each month. Then, the subscriber chooses which one(s) they want based on synopses and reviews from other readers. Give a gift subscription starting at $59.99 for three months.

They come in the form of grounds, whole beans, or pods that are compatible with Keurig and Nespresso machines. Indoor plants are an easy solution for loneliness — not only because they can take a space from drab to homey, but also because it just feels good to take care of something. If you're not sure of their skill level (or of the collection they already have), a gift card to The Sill lets them pick out some new greenery on their own. Its houseplants start at $39 and can be upgraded with different-colored planters. The gift of not having to walk in the rain or take public transportation with heavy groceries is a godsend.

The company showcases women and non-binary authors, and their subscription options include quarterly ($54/each), semi-annual ($51/each), or yearly packages ($48/each).

259,Apple reportedly cancels plans for iPhone subscription service,"Apple has apparently shelved its plans for aniPhone hardware subscription service. It's just as well — the last thing anyone needs in this economy is yet another ongoing expense. Bloombergreports that Apple is no longer working on its iPhone subscription service, according to sources close to the matter.First rumoured in 2022, the tech giant's hardware subscription would have given customers the option to pay a regular monthly fee to essentially rent their iPhone. They'd also be able to upgrade to the latest iPhone as new models were released. This iPhone subscription service had reportedly been planned for launch the same year it was leaked, but was delayed by issues such as software problems and legal concerns. Now it seems the service won't arrive at all. Judging from the scant details that have emerged, Apple's proposed subscription service seemed to have borne some similarities to itsiPhone Upgrade Program. Introduced in 2015, this program allows customers to enter a two-year monthly payment plan for their iPhone, with current plansstarting at $39.50 per monthfor the 128GB iPhone 16. Once they've made 12 payments, they're eligible to upgrade their phone when the next model arrives, entering a new loan. However, the iPhone Upgrade Program enables customers to ultimately own their device outright if they complete the payment plan. In contrast, Apple's previously planned service sounded more akin to renting a device, with customers presumably required to return their iPhone if they cancelled their subscription. Apple alsodiscontinued its Apple Pay Later serviceearlier this year, a possible indication that the company is reassessing its financial products. Initially announced in 2022,Apple Pay Laterwas a Buy Now Pay Later service that allowed customers to split payments into multiple smaller installments spread out over several weeks.

Nothing makes you feel exhausted like watching kids go full pelt. Indeed, kids have the kind of energy that most adults could only dream of. Most of the time they spend all day running around just, well, because. It's exhausting just thinking about it, never mind watching them charge around the place with boundless energy. For that reason, you might not think that kids need to track their activities, but in this increasingly sedentary society, it's important to make physical movement a priority from a young age. For the sake of their future health and fitness, it's important that little ones don't lose that energetic spark. That's where fitness trackers come in. Fortunately, there are a number fitness trackers made specifically for children. They're focused on encouraging an active lifestyle (rather than weight loss, which isn't healthy for kids to obsess over). Trackers can also build good habits, like keeping up with homework and chores. If you're still not sure, check out the below information — along with a round-up of the best fitness trackers for kids right now. Fitness trackers for kids are simplified versions of adult models. They typically trade out advanced metrics like an ECG app for motivational games and rewards. They're a cheaper, simpler, more durable option. The band size is also tailored to little wrists, of course, with kid-friendly designs and fun colours. Kids' fitness trackers are all about setting goals — fitness or otherwise. Many offer parents the opportunity to set daily reminders for their kids to do things like brushing their teeth, completing their homework, or cleaning their room. Mundane tasks are more fun when they're integrated into a model of games, tiered rewards, and maybe even a little friendly leaderboard competition among siblings. Older kids are fine to graduate to afitness tracker for adults— it's likely that they'll already have a phone at that point, anyway — but the functionality of a full-fledged smartwatch probably isn't ideal for kids. Adult fitness trackers that graze smartwatch status, like the Fitbit Sense, can access payment apps or social media apps. Some parents may prefer that those not be an option at all. We'd be remiss not to mention the fact that most kid-specific fitness trackers (even the leaders from Fitbit and Garmin) can't be used as a standalone device to track a child's location. If the peace of mind that comes with onboard GPS is important to you, opt for a kid-friendly smartwatch with GPS (included below) or a relatively-affordable Fitbit. The companies behind the leading kids' fitness trackers — the likes of Garmin andFitbit— have both stated that their activity trackers put parents in control of approving any friend requests for fitness-based challenges. Parents can access these things via the corresponding app. The location of the wearer is also never shared. The basic functions of a fitness tracker are pretty standard across the board: Step counting, active minute tracking, and distance traveled are big ones, and heart rate monitoring is becoming more common. With those solidified, there are a few other features to compare on your must-have list. Consider how long the battery life lasts. Will your kid remember to charge the tracker regularly? Sleep tracking is another metric that could be important. Quality shut-eye is important for physical energy as well as their attention, behaviour, memory, and learning skills.Water resistanceis also crucial between spills, splashes, rain, and sweat. We've checked out everything on offer from the biggest brands in the fitness tracker game, and lined up a selection of standout devices. These are the best fitness trackers for kids in 2024.","We've lined up all the best fitness trackers for your kid, including popular models from top brands like Fitbit and Garmin.",Mashable,https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-fitness-trackers-for-kids-uk,
264,NASA just jumped online to correct outrageous space station misinformation,"Sure, the agingInternational Space Stationhas a well-known,ongoing leak. But it's not nearly in danger of imminently crashing. NASAresponded to apostonX, formerly Twitter, claiming that the ""ISS is going to crash soon via de-orbit,"" and included a screenshot from a4chan postwith a blurry graph showing altitude data. The space agency likely responded in an attempt to get ahead of a dubious post that's picking up decent traction (with nearly 9,000 likes and hundreds of shares by the afternoon of Dec. 18). ""The International@Space_Stationcontinues to orbit the Earth as planned, and the crew aboard is safe. You can track the space station’s current path anytime athttps://spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm,"" NASA posted on X. The post is an example of thedeluge of misinformationavailable on X. Indeed, X has a feature, Community Notes, that the platform says allows users to ""collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts"" — and it can sometimes address egregious misinformation. But not always, and not immediately.Misinformation can thriveon the platform. In this case, NASA's busy communications team thought it wise to respond. Such a response probably won't stop the conspiracy-minded — who can crave ""knowledge"" that makes themfeel unique or superior— from sharing and amplifying the space station post, but perhaps it can inform some users and stem this particular wave of misinformation. NASA expects the space station to continue orbiting Earth and performing science through around 2031. A U.S. Deorbit Vehicle built bySpaceXwill attach to the ISS and bring it down toEarthin a controlled, safe manner, specifically avoiding populated regions. In the 2030s, the space agency expectscommercial space stationsto take responsibility for providing a U.S. presence in low-Earth orbit. You can often easily spot the space station, the largest structure ever built inspace, when it passes above your home. Check outspotthestation.nasa.govfor an overhead sighting near you.

265,"Supreme Court must halt TikTok ban, ACLU argues","UPDATE: Dec. 18, 2024, 11:36 a.m. ESTThis story was updated after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges on the TikTok ban. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court toblock the expected TikTok ban, which looms over the social media company as January approaches. Meanwhile, TikTok had made its own case for intervention — and the court has now responded to the call. ""The Constitution imposes an extraordinarily high bar on this kind of mass censorship. The Supreme Court should take up this important case and protect the rights of millions of Americans to freely express themselves and engage with others around the world,"" wrote deputy director of ACLU’s National Security Project Patrick Toomey in the appeal. Theamicus briefwas submitted on Dec. 17 by the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. On Dec. 18, the U.S. Supreme Court formallyagreed to hear challenges filed by TikTok and ByteDance, with oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10. TikTok and its allies have called the ban a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech, and the company has consistently denied any connections to Chinese government intelligence or the sharing of American users' data, which is the leading justification for the forced divestment of TikTok from Chinese ownership. Barring a decision by the highest court, the ban,signed by President Biden in April, willgo into effect Jan. 19. TikTok could have divested from its parent company, ByteDance, to comply with the law and halt an outright ban, but it had resisted any sale, most likely pending another court decision. Earlier this week, the District of Columbia Court of Appealsdenied an emergency injunctionsubmitted by TikTok that would delay the ban's effect until the Supreme Court could render an opinion understrict scrutiny. The Appeals court argued that highest scrutiny had been reached, and that national security interests justified the U.S. government's action. The ACLU and its partners argued the court's reasoning was incorrect. ""The D.C. Circuit failed to fully address the law’s profound implications for the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans who use TikTok,"" wrote the ACLU. ""While the lower court’s decision correctly recognized that the statute triggers First Amendment scrutiny, it barely addressed users’ First Amendment interests in speaking, sharing, and receiving information on the platform. The court also perplexingly attempted to cast the government’s ban on TikTok as a vindication of users’ First Amendment rights, which it is not."" The ACLU has retained that the TikTok ban is a violation of federally protected rights, including free speech, calling the forceable sale ""unconstitutional"" in a statement released in March. A few months prior the civil rights organization argued that a ban on any such social media app would be ""a dangerous act of censorship."" ""Restricting citizens’ access to foreign media is a practice that has long been associated with repressive regimes,"" wrote Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, ""and we should be very wary of letting the practice take root here.""

266,Nissan and Honda could merge to compete in the EV market,"Two of Japan's auto giants, Nissan and Honda, are reportedly in early talks to merge,according toThe Nikkei, in a bold move to strengthen their position against China’s growing clout in theelectric vehicle(EV) market. While no concrete plans have emerged yet — and both companies remain tight-lipped on the subject — Japanese broadcaster TBS suggests that an official announcement of these discussions could come as early as next week. Back in March, Nissan and Honda signaled their willingness to collaborate by agreeing to explore a strategic EV partnership. But,as the BBC points out, a full-blown merger of two of Japan’s automotive heavyweights would send ripples through both the political and economic landscape — a merger risks jobs and partnerships with other companies like French manufacturer Renault. According to the BBC, Honda and Nissan have been steadily losing ground in China, a market that represented nearly 70 percent of global EV sales as of November. Despite their combined global sales of 7.4 million vehicles in 2023, both brands are struggling to hold their own against cost-effective EV Chinese manufacturers like BYD.

268,OpenAI now lets you call ChatGPT on your phone,"OpenAIis taking a big step towards makingChatGPTthe ""everything app"" by allowing users to call it on their phones and message it on WhatsApp. As of today, you can call ChatGPT or message it in WhatsApp. By adding 1-800-ChatGPT, to your contacts list, you can call it and chat with it on a phone call. In the live demo, OpenAI shared how users can call ChatGPT on a road trip and ask it questions about sites and landmarks like the ""Flintstone House."" This was demoed on an iPhone, but OpenAI also shared how users can make calls with an old flip phone and a rotary phone, and lo-and-behold, ChatGPT picks up the phone and answers your questions. Calling with ChatGPT comes with15 minutesof free calling for users with a phone plan in the U.S. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that data from voice calls and WhatsApps messages will not be used for model training. ChatGPT phone calls wasn't on our12 Days of OpenAIbingo card, but in hindsight it makes sense as part of OpenAI's overall strategy to embed its technology into our daily lives. ""The mission of OpenAI is to make artificial general intelligence beneficial to all of humanity. And part of that is making it as accessible as possible to as many people as we can,"" said CPO Kevin Weil in the livestream. Over the past few weeks OpenAI has launched ChatGPT features likeCanvasfor iterating on writing and code,Projectsas smart folders for organizing your conversations, and full availability of its search engineChatGPT Search.

269,Strava was the only good Wrapped this year,"Spotify Wrapped and its many dupes sucked this year on just about every platform — except Strava. Spotify was the first company to take all of the data we gave it throughout the year, neatly package it into a shareable format, and give us a Wrapped that we all actually enjoyed. It started a phenomena of Wrappeds, which seemed to peak this year with such hits as ""Asana Wrapped"" and Vanguardretirement accountWrapped. But we owe all good Wrappeds to Spotify's impact. Unfortunately, those are all the compliments I can give Spotify this year. Wrapped 2024was a disappointment. We didn't get genres,potentially thanks toSpotify laying off key data scientists this year, and it was way too much AI and not enough real creativity.As one Reddit user wrote, ""This year's wrap is what happens when you replace creatives with AI."" ""Past years had fun, unique ideas, like telling you what city your listening habits were most similar to or giving you an MBTI-like listening type. This year we don’t have any of that, just a bunch of AI 'features' that aren't very good. They didn’t even do as well with basic stats — where are my top 5 genres or the number of genres I listened to? And the graphics are incredibly uninspiring,""another user wrote on Reddit. ""I don’t want AI, I want something creative."" Spotify Wrapped was so bad that it has peopleconsidering moving to Apple Music, even though that Wrapped waspretty boring, too. But there was less AI, it was less annoying, and, frankly, there's less hype about it — so it's not quite as disappointing when it doesn't hit. Earlier this week, we got another Wrapped people were looking forward to and then, immediately, disappointed by: Goodreads Wrapped. It was designed by what I have to assume was a raccoon wading through peanut butter to click the wrong buttons on the most boring Canva template to ever exist. Just look at this: The images aren't built in the dimensions necessary to share on social media, which kind of defeats the purpose of designing a social-forward Wrapped. It was at least expected —all Goodreads does is disappoint its users. We're still waiting on Wrappeds from other book tracking apps like Fable and StoryGraph, which tend to have more interesting visuals, so hope is still alive for the readers in the chat. By my estimation, there was just one Wrapped that didn't disappoint: Strava Wrapped, also called Year in Sport. It has everything you want: Interesting visuals, fun takeaways like who likes your posts the most, your top sports, your total time working out, your total days active, your total distance and elevation, and more. It was good because it was simple and data focused. There was not a lot of AI junk or weird, useless millennial-coded drivel a la Spotify'sPink Pilates Princess. Nearly every single post on X or Reddit about Year in Sport is some version of ""forget your Spotify Wrapped, Year in Sport was actually good."" There's an argument to be made that we use these apps to better ourselves with our own data. Spotify and Goodreads show us how our music and book taste might lack diversity, which could encourage us to listen and read differently. Strava shows us how much work we actually put into our fitness this year. But, more realistically, these appsmake living performative and competitive, ultimately watering down the reason we actually enjoy reading, running, or listening to music. To that end: Wrappeds are intended to be shared. Maybe you are more evolved, and you post your Wrapped on social media without the need for validation. Maybe you don't imagine anyone responding, ""Wow, you have incredible taste and your dedication to bettering yourself makes you definitively better than everyone else."" Not me, though. I would love to be evolved enough to say that I read, run, and listen to music purely for the beauty of art and love of the game. Unfortunately, like seemingly everyone else online, I'm a hungry little rat scouring my tiny world for as much attention as I can possibly gorge myself on. And I was given nothing to eat.","Spotify and GoodReads Wrapped flopped this year, but Strava's Year in Sport delivered the simple, shareable experience we wanted.",Mashable,https://mashable.com/article/strava-goodreads-spotify-wrapped-2024,

271,Pornhub will block Florida to ring in the new year,"Florida Manwon't be able to access the internet's biggest adult website soon. Pornhubwill block visitors from Florida starting Jan. 1, 2025, according to the porn site's parent company Aylo. ""You will lose access to Pornhub in 14 days,"" reads apop-up messagethat displays on Pornhub for users accessing the site from the state of Florida. ""Did you know that your government wants you to give your driver's license before you can access Pornhub?"" the pop-up prompt continues. ""As crazy as that sounds, it's true. You'll be required to prove you are 18 years or older such as by uploading your government ID for every adult content website you'd like to access."" Pornhub's Florida ban is a response to Florida state law HB3, which Governor Ron DeSantissigned into lawearlier this year. The law officially goes into effect at the beginning of 2025. Florida's HB3 basically prohibits anyone under the age of 14 from having an account on a social media platform. However, the language in the bill can be construed to basically cover any online platform that serves material that can be considered ""harmful to minors."" Under the law, tech companies will be required to verify users' ages and delete any account belonging to users under the age of 14. If a child is 14 or 15 and wants to sign up for a social media platform, they would be required to get their parents consent. If a company fails to act based on the law, companies can be sued on behalf of the child and fined tens of thousands of dollars for allowing that child to set up an account. Civil rights organizations like the ACLU have shared theiroppositionto the law, blasting it as ""censorship."" “Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide, including Florida, have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard and dangerous,” reads a statement regarding Pornhub from Aylo, as first reported byFlorida Politics. “Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy. Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.” Aylo says that the company supports age verification and restricting access to minors but believes this law goes about it the wrong way. The company has cited user safety and privacy issues as problems with the law's implementation as well as being an ineffective way to protect children from adult content. Florida isn't the first state banned byPornhub. Lawmakers in Republican-led states across the U.S. have passed strict age verification laws specifically targeting adult websites in recent years. Louisiana was the first state to require pornography websites to require visitors to upload ID before accessing the site in 2022. States like Arkansas, Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia followed suit.

That's according to testing done byTom's Hardware, who found that playing PC games while running the recently launchedNvidia desktop appcan reduce in-game frame rates by as much as 15 percent in some cases. Tom's Hardware tried this out with several different games, includingBlack Myth WukongandBaldur's Gate 3, and found performance dips of varying degrees in all of them. So, what the heck is going on here? It turns out that the Nvidia app, which Nvidia launched last month to give users a one-stop shop for downloading new drivers and whatnot, has some AI-fueled ""game filters"" that are theoretically supposed to make games look a little better. These are turned on by default, and if they're on, they can reduce frame rates in games, even when the filters aren't being applied to the game in question. Nvidia gave a statement to Tom's Hardware acknowledging the issue and giving simple instructions for how to turn the feature off and fix your performance problems: Open the Nvidia app and go to Settings Go to Features Go to Overlay Go to Game Filters and Photo Mode and turn off the game filters Apparently, this will cure what ails you.

278,How to cope with heartbreak during the holidays,"It was Christmas Day night and I couldn't sleep. Not through excitement for continued Twixmas celebrations, but because I knew I had a difficult and almost certainlyheartbreakingconversation ahead of me. Myself-esteemwas at an all time low and asituationshipof mine had developed into an emotionally torturous interaction.Sexwith a good friend meant catching unreciprocated feelings. Despite the friendship, he'd gone quiet and ghosted me during a winter lockdown. It felt terrible. Rotating all possibilities, my mind searched for answers during this period of silence. My inner critic used the situation as a stick to beat me with, evidence of all my shortcomings, proof that I was deficient in other people's eyes (not just my own). When he got back in touch to search for guilt absolution, to make sure his reputation remained unscathed in our friendship group, I was confused by his intentions and, I'll admit, I hoped he'd had a change of heart. Things came to a long overdue head as I sat next to my parents' Christmas tree sipping a gin and tonic — I knew I needed to end my misery and ask him what he wanted from me. Deep down, I realised the answer possibly wasn't going to be what my heart wanted, but I needed to be set free from this waiting room of sorrow. My anxiety was mounting to unbearable levels and I knew I couldn't put off the conversation any longer. So, on Boxing Day morning, I rolled over in bed and awoke to a message from him, apologising yet again for his behaviour. I sighed in recognition of what I needed to do. After I'd sent the dreaded message, I sat in silence waiting for the inevitable. When his message arrived, the contents weren't surprising to me — but that didn't make it any less painful. And though I was free from the turmoil, that's when anxiety gave way to heartbreak, a feeling that wasn't exactly what I'd hoped to be dealing with over Christmas, a time of year I usually love. A neverending stream of tears rolled down my face as I sat watching my favourite films with my family. My mum looked at me with pity and concern, as I muffled tragic sniffs on the sofa. It was, as you can imagine, not a great time. And no amount of pigs in blankets or Terry's Chocolate Oranges would make me feel better (though you can't say I didn't try!). Heartbreak, sadly, doesn't take a day off when it's a special occasion. And the holidays can be particularly difficult when you're in the throes of a breakup, or the ending of a situationship. As writer Annie Lord, author ofNotes On Heartbreak, tells me, ""It's pretty horrible because everyone's so loved up during Christmas."" ""There are couples everywhere, holding hands at the Christmas markets, looking for rings in shops, and when you turn on the TV they're still there, kissing in cozy cottages inThe Holiday,declaring their love inLove Actually.I think the coldness makes people want to cozy up with someone they love,"" she says. Just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to put up with it, though. Mashable spoke to psychotherapists for tips on coping with heartbreak during the holidays. If there's anything guaranteed to make you want to throw your phone at the wall, it's seeing endless pics of engagement rings with the caption ""so, this happened!"" You simply don't need to see it right now. Fiona Yassin, family psychotherapist and founder and clinical director ofThe Wave Clinic, says it's a good idea to limit your social media use so you're not bombarded with what your friends and internet pals are up to during this period. ""When we see others having fun on social media and we feel we are not, it can trigger negative emotions like loneliness and isolation,"" says Yassin. Here are some tips onhow to limit your Instagram usageandTikTok usage. The holidays are a time that champions joy. And that can be particularly challenging when you feel, well, pretty rotten. Giving yourself permission to feel sad is important in validating the difficult emotions you'll be (understandably!) feeling during this time. Dr. Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder ofThe Chelsea Psychology Clinic, says, ""A big break up is comparable to grief, particularly if that person was very embedded in your life. Instead of rushing out to date again and trying to 'get over it,' be gentle with yourself and give yourself time and space to process the loss."" Also, don't feel bad for feeling sad. ""Don't feel like you're ruining other people's good time,"" author Lord says. ""You are not a burden. It's an honour to be able to be there for people when they need it."" If you've beenghosted, Mashable hassome tips on how to move on. Heartbreak is a universal emotion and chances are, everyone around you right now will have gone through it at some point in their life. Opening up to others about what you're going through can make you feel less alone. ""Speak to your parents or any older members of your family. Most of the time they have been through this before and they survived, knowing this can give you hope,"" says Lord. ""Christmas means you're often surrounded by your family and friends. Celebrate the love you get from them, a love that is often less intense or glamorous, but a lot more enduring than romantic love."" Want moresex and dating storiesin your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weeklyAfter Dark newsletter. Going home or to safe spaces can sometimes give you an opportunity to reconnect with your younger self. ""Going home can be quite grounding,"" she adds. ""You're surrounded by all this stuff from when you were younger which can put things into perspective. I remember finding an old diary of mine where I was crying over a guy and though I was now upset about another one, I could still see that I was dealing with it in a much better way."" Not everyone has access to a support network at this time of year. If your heartbreak is impacting your mental health or if you're experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody. You can reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988; the Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860; or the Trevor Project at 866-488-7386. Text ""START"" to Crisis Text Line at 741-741. Contact the NAMI HelpLine at 1-800-950-NAMI, Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. ET, or email[email protected]. If you're based in the UK,contact the Samaritans(116 123). If you don't like the phone, consider using the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline Chat atcrisischat.org. Here is alist of international resources. As a practical daily means to cope with heartbreak, Yassin recommends equipping yourself with some grounding techniques, which can be helpful for people to manage and work through emotions they wish they weren't feeling. Grounding techniques are exercises or activities that help you refocus on what's happening in the present moment, distracting yourself from triggers, anxious feelings, or difficult emotions. ""By using grounding techniques, we are not saying that we will not deal with or process the emotions and sensations, but we are saying that right now, at this moment, this is not going to intrude in what I’m doing,"" says Yassin. ""Walking can be really good to bring you back into the moment. When we walk and put one foot in front of the other we are actually stimulating both sides of the brain in a process called Bilateral Stimulation (BLS) which can feel soothing for some."" Here aresix free grounding meditationsto help you get started. Repetitive activities like cross-stitch or crochet can have a soothing effect for some, while others like to keep themselves in motion. ""Journaling or watching a good movie can also be effective grounding techniques,"" says Yassin. Touroni also recommends journaling as it ""helps get difficult thoughts and feelings down on paper so you can gain greater clarity and a new perspective.""Check out Mashable's non-intimidating guide to journaling to get started. When you're feeling low, it can be difficult to muster the energy to look after ourselves. Taking care of your immediate physical needs can be a way of making yourself feel a little better, despite not being able to shift the difficult emotions that come with heartbreak. Make sure you're hydrated, eating, and getting plenty of rest. ""Make sure you’re doing activities that keep you both physically and mentally healthy e.g. regular exercise, eating healthy, nutritious meals etc.,"" Touroni says. ""Avoid turning to substances to numb any difficult thoughts and feelings. They might provide relief in the short-term but are likely to make things harder in the long run."" Can't sleep? Here are some tips on tangible things you can do to help you drift off. Heartbreak can also be accompanied with feelings of panic, especially if you have been contending with anxious thoughts about""running out of time.""If you can resist some of these feelings and try to reassure that anxious voice in your head, know that you are allowed to take time to heal, and that you are enough on your own. Yassir advises against rushing into another relationship straight away— often referred to as a ""rebound"". ""People that rebound tend to be those who are already struggling around interpersonal relations and relationships. Build a relationship with yourself before having a relationship with someone else. It’s unlikely a rebound relationship will be healthy if you don’t give yourself the time and space to be able to work out what you’re feeling."" As the queen of reading-into-text-messages, I feel highly qualified in saying that it's completely natural to want to search for signs of hope in any contact you might have had from the heartbreak-inflicter. But this habit can also prolong your agony and make it difficult to accept what's really happening. ""If they message you 'Happy Christmas' don't start thinking it signals anything,"" says Lord. ""They're probably just trying to be polite. At the same time if you're the one who ended the relationship don't send a text, it will confuse your ex."" A good rule of thumb is to assume that there is never a hidden meaning to their messages. If a person wants something badly enough, they'll find a way to make sure their meaning and intention are fully understood. Tell yourself that if they want to communicate something important, they will likely do so in an explicit manner. When you're feeling sad, the last thing you need is another voice inside your head telling you what a misery you are. Your inner critic can rear their annoying head during this time to convince you that you're bringing down the vibe, but most people understand that heartbreak truly is the worst. ""Be really kind to yourself,"" advises Lord. ""Don't get annoyed if you don't get off the sofa for the entire day, that's what Christmas is for and everyone's doing it too. It might feel like in doing these things you're going backward, but you're not you're getting somewhere because stewing and feeling miserable is all part of the process."" If you're really struggling, don't suffer in silence. Speak to amental health professionalif you can.Shout is a 24/7 free mental health service in the UK(Text SHOUT to 85258). If you're in the U.S., text ""START"" to Crisis Text Line at 741-741. ""If you find yourself stuck in the same recurring relationship patterns, it could be a sign to dig a little deeper,"" Touroni advises. ""Negative early life experiences can sometimes impact the types of relationships we form — and choose —in later life. If you suspect there are things in your past that you haven’t dealt with, therapy is a great place to start this process."" Lean on your support network and don't bottle up your feelings. ""If you’re struggling, reach out to friends and family,"" Touroni adds. ""These are the moments when we need their support the most, and the right people will want to be there for you."" If you're nursing a bruised or shattered heart this Christmas, know that you're not alone. And know that it won't be forever. Take care of yourself.

283,Death of a Unicorn trailer: Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd run over a unicorn. Chaos ensues.,"Jenna Ortega (Wednesday) and Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) commit the most magical hit-and-run in the trailer forA24'sDeath of a Unicorn. The directorial debut for Alex Scharfman (producer ofHouse of Spoils) centers on Elliot (Rudd) and his daughter Ridley (Ortega) as they head to a weekend retreat hosted by Elliot's billionaire boss Dell Leopold (Richard E. Grant,The Franchise). On the way there, they hit and kill a unicorn with their car. But what they see as a bizarre tragedy — and possibly a crime? — Dell sees as an opportunity. He and his ultra-rich Leopold family (played byThe Bear's Will Poulter andOnly Murders in the Building's Téa Leoni) decide to research the poor, dead unicorn's curative properties. According to the film's first trailer, it might even be the cure for cancer. (""That's the biggest one!"" Poulter's character exclaims.) But if you thought killing a unicorn (and exploiting it for dubious studies) was already crazy, the second half ofDeath of a Unicorn's trailer kicks it into high gear. Turns out, there's another unicorn on the loose. This one has more of a snarling, werewolf vibe — and it is bloodthirsty as can be. Basically, it looks like that one killer unicorn scene fromCabin in the Woodswalked so this could run. Death of a Unicornhits theaters this spring.

Inside the Look Around view, you can click and drag with your mouse to turn around, zoom in and out with a pinch gesture on your trackpad, or double tap anywhere to move the camera forward. It's a little different than Google Maps' Street View, which enables you to drag the little yellow man anywhere on the map to get a view of that precise location. On Apple Maps, you have to activate Look Around, and then click on a precise location on the map to see the surroundings there. Also, Apple Maps lets you move around in smaller increments, which can be useful if you need to check something in a very precise location, such as a street number. Unlike Street View, Apple's Look Around is not available just about anywhere; you'll find it in some cities in the U.S., most of Europe, the UK, Japan, and Israel, to name a few places. For a full list,check Apple's website. The feature works in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari; you can check it outon Apple Maps.

297,OpenAIs plan to make ChatGPT the everything app has never been more clear,"OpenAI is making major moves as it sets the table for 2025. To the casual observer, OpenAI has spent the past week flooding the tech world with announcements and rollouts — not all of which gel into any sort of clear product agenda. It's all part of a holiday-timed event called ""12 Days of OpenAI,"" a plan to ship a product or feature every day for 12 days marketed by the AI giant as bold and ambitious, even though some of the announcements, like afolder systemfor organizing your ChatGPT conversations, might seem like filler. But if you step back and look at the sum of its parts, you can see that OpenAI is deliberately laying a roadmap for ChatGPT to become the next ""everything app."" The term comes from Elon Musk when talking about transforming X, into ""a single application that encompasses everything,"" as he told employees in a leaked 2023 all-hands meeting. ""You can do payments, messages, video, calling, whatever you’d like, from one single, convenient place."" Musk's plans to build X into an everything app have yet to come to fruition. But it's still a useful description for the strategy of embedding a technology so deeply into users' lives that they use it for all of their technological needs. OpenAI seems to be doing something similar with ChatGPT by launching user-friendly tools oriented around never having to leave the app. There'sChatGPT Search, its Google search engine competitor for accessing the web,Canvas, a kind of digital notepad for iterating on writing and code,Projects, a tool for creating and customizing projects that works with ChatGPT Search and Canvas, andAdvanced Voice Mode, avisionand voice modalities tool that can see your screen and walk you through tasks. Beside you the whole time is ChatGPT, underpinned byGPT-4o, that can generate responses with text, audio, voice, and images. ChatGPT ison your iPhonenow too, thanks to a partnership with Apple, the original lifestyle embedders. In thenear future, OpenAI will take one step closer toward its goal of ""achieving AGI"" by putting all these tools together in anagentthat can perform multi-step tasks on the user's behalf. This isn't just speculation. CEO Sam Altmansaidat OpenAI DevDay that ""2025 is when agents will work,"" and CPO Kevin Weil reinforced this in a Reddit AMA,sayingChatGPT being able to perform tasks on its own will be ""a big theme in 2025."" Indeed,reportsfrom Bloomberg and The Information say OpenAI's agentic tool, codenamed ""Operator,"" will be able to book flights, write code, and generally browse the web. Meanwhile, AI model development might berunning out of high quality training dataand experiencingdiminishing returns. And generative AI has a persistent hallucination problem thatmight not everbe fully resolved, which leads to the proliferation ofAI slop, and also harmfulmisinformation,defamation, and potentialcopyright infringement. But despite genAI's proven unreliability for certain things andAI-weary public sentiment, OpenAI is doing its damndest to make the case for ChatGPT as the everything app with billion dollar stakes. Imagine you or your partner is pregnant for the first time and you have no idea what to do. You frantically use ChatGPT Search to research baby books, pregnancy diets and workouts, the best prenatal vitamins, birthing classes, why doctors hate doulas, baby gear, etc. You create a ChatGPT Project called ""Baby Deliverables,"" and upload all of your research and notes, asking ChatGPT to help you plan a timeline of tasks before the baby's arrival and a budget for all the new expenses. As the pregnancy progresses, you use Advanced Voice Mode with vision to ask ChatGPT if the amount of swelling in you or your partner's feet is normal. You might even find yourself confiding in Advanced Voice Mode about the difficult hormonal changes or sharing ultrasound photos with the warm and friendly disembodied voice who's never busy, unlike family and friends. Soon, you might even be able to compile a list of gifts and automatically populate a baby shower registry, or ask ChatGPT to research the best strollers and buy the best-rated one within your price range. All of this is already or likely soon to be possible within ChatGPT. And that's exactly what OpenAI wants — particularly since this scenario seeps beyond the 9-to-5 work productivity use case and into everyday companionship. The everything app concept isn't something Musk came up with. In fact, he was referencing apps in China like WeChat, a messaging, calling, social media, news, and payment app all rolled into one. But it was really Apple that championed the concept with the ""walled garden"" ecosystem. Apple is famous for slick, beautifully-designed products that seamlessly integrate with other Apple devices, while beingincompatible with non-Apple products. Apple sells its users on the promise of realizing their untapped potential, or as Mashable's Chris Taylorcalls it, ""aspirational creativity,"" thus locking them into a neverending product cycle. With itsreality distortion field, Apple's best trick is to simultaneously make consumers feel like they need Apple devices to be the most productive and creative versions of themselves while defending its anti-competitive business practices. As Cory Doctorow puts it in hisdescription of the cult of mac, ""Apple’s most valuable intangible asset isn’t its patents or copyrights — it’s an army of people who believe that using products from a $2.89 trillion multinational makes them members of an oppressed religious minority whose identity is coterminal with the interests of Apple’s shareholders."" When you look at OpenAI's recent launches, it seems like Sam Altman has taken a leaf out of the Steve Jobs playbook. ""We really want to make ChatGPT as frictionless and easy to use everywhere,"" said Altman in a meta moment announcing theChatGPT and iOS integration. ""We love Apple devices and so this integration is one that we're very very proud of."" ChatGPT's new features and updates seem to be carefully designed with the consumer in mind: paying special attention to the needs of a user's workflow or overall online behavior. In other words, the promise of enhanced productivity and creative fulfillment is just a monthly payment away. ChatGPT subscriptions are a critical part of OpenAI's revenue model. According to financial documents reviewed by theNew York Times, around 10 million users pay $20 for a ChatGPT Plus subscription and OpenAI plans to raise the price to $44 a month over the next five years. And that was reported before OpenAI announcedChatGPT Profor $200 a month. Combine that with OpenAI's revenue projections of $100 billion by 2029 and you can start to see the company's plan from novelty chatbot to everything app unfold. That all hinges on making ChatGPT more valuable to its users. ChatGPT has already started to move away from the restricted chatbot experience. In a few short years, it's evolved to support image, audio, and video in addition to text and will soon have more autonomous abilities. Speaking at Stanford University last spring, Altman called GPT-4 ""the dumbest model any of you will ever have to use again,"" and described the forthcoming GPT-5 as a ""significant leap forward"" during an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival. That's assuming the much-hyped GPT-5 isstill part of the plan. In the meantime, OpenAI is rounding out ChatGPT with updates and features that emphasize its everyday usefulness. But just as OpenAI's allegedly altruisticmission""to ensure that AGI… benefits all of humanity,"" merits new scrutiny in the company'sattempttobecome for-profit, so does the intention behind its flurry of product announcements. OpenAI is a business and the goal of any business is to sell you stuff. Some of the new features may seem minor, but it's all part of a broader plan to hit that revenue projection. And maybe achieve AGI along the way. TopicsChatGPTOpenAI","OpenAI's 12-day livestream marathon saw a mix of minor (Canvas) and major (Sora) launches.

300,More People Should Watch This Canadian Alien Christmas Cartoon Cult Classic,"While many folks love the Rankin/Bass Christmas cartoons like Rudoph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and others prefer classic animated holiday specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas or How the Grinch Stole Christmas, my holiday tastes run a big less mainstream. The 1977 holiday specialCosmic Christmas-- the first-ever cartoon from the longtime Canadian animation powerhouseNelvana-- has been my December comfort entertainment ever since I rediscovered it streaming online. This year it's available to watch for free only on Tubi. Unlike today's pixel-perfect and polished animation, the drawings in Cosmic Christmas are a retro delight -- it feels like a messy mashup of Mad Magazine's Don Martin and classic animator Ralph Bakshi. Cosmic Christmas isn't as squiggly as Dr. Katz or Home Movies, but there's a hand-drawn chaos that seems to no longer exist in modern cartoons. The town's outrageous mayor and befuddled police chief get some of Cosmic Christmas' best jokes. The story of Cosmic Christmas follows Peter, a young boy with a pet goose named Lucy. He discovers three mysterious aliens who've landed their spaceship on the outskirts of a town preparing for Christmas. The three visitors report seeing a new star in the sky outside Earth 2,000 years ago, and have come to the planet to learn the true meaning of the holiday. Peter's grandma, a gang of colorful teen delinquents and Lucy the goose drive the holiday plot forward until it reaches an exciting climax that shouldn't be too scary for kids of any age, and a resolution that warms the heart. A gang of tough talking teenagers have their eyes set on Peter's goose Lucy. Clocking in at a brisk 24 minutes, Cosmic Christmas wastes a little time on weird musical interludes -- including a bizarre dance number with Lucy and the alien's flying robot helper -- but the core action keeps the story moving forward to a satisfying conclusion. When first meeting the aliens, Peter explains the ""Star of Bethlehem"" and mentions Jesus Christ, but Cosmic Christmas mostly approaches the holiday from a secular perspective. The true meaning of Christmas, according to Peter, is, ""love, peace and caring for others."" Fun fact:Cosmic Christmas director Clive A. Smith also directed the Star Wars special A Wookiee's Christmas (also known as The Faithful Wookiee). If you enjoy weird retro animation or are looking for something a little different to watch with the kids this holiday season, give Cosmic Christmas a shot while it's free on Tubi.

301,22 TV Shows on Netflix Perfect for Your Next Binge-Watch,"Deciding on a show to watch on Netflix can be overwhelming given the plethora of titles across all genres. The streamer is known for its sprawling dramas, addictive reality competitions and original comedies. And with so much to choose from, we've narrowed down some of the most entertaining shows on the streaming service right now, including two new series currently in the streamer's Top Ten, Black Doves and No Good Deed, and evergreen favorites like Peaky Blinders and The Crown. The toughest bit will be deciding which one to start with. If you're looking for your next comfort show, here's our roundup of some of the best series you can binge on Netflix. And if you'd rather go with a movie instead, here are our picks for thebest Netflix original movies. Read more:Best Streaming Services of 2024 A compelling, artful retelling of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. The Crown touches on many themes beyond just the monarchy, including politics, family and the tumult of royal marriages -- namely that of Charles and Diana. Beyond the spectacular casting across all six seasons, the show is supported by strong writing and gripping storylines that stir up emotion in viewers, regardless of how they actually feel about the British monarchy. Inspired by real events from writer-actor Richard Gadd's own life, Baby Reindeer follows Donny Dunn, an aspiring comedian whose day job is bartending. The bar is where he extends kindness to a stranger named Martha, setting off a months-long chain ordeal of stalking. Donny's experience being stalked triggers a wave of unaddressed trauma, making for an interesting story. The seven-episode series recently won a string of Emmy awards and is available to binge. Lauded as one of the best television shows of all time, Breaking Bad has all the merits of a standout series: a suspenseful storyline, dynamic characters and shocking plot twists -- many of which are not for the faint of heart. It follows high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who turns to cooking meth when he's diagnosed with cancer and worries about providing for his family. But his knack for producing the illegal substance leads him down roads he never imagined. Animated series Blue Eye Samurai unfolds with Mizu, a mixed-race woman warrior who is seeking revenge against four men -- one of whom is her father. Set during the Edo period in Japan, the show features Maya Erskine as Mizu, Stephanie Hsu, Ming-Na Wen, George Takei, Masi Oka, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Mark Dacascos among the cast. Season 1 of the Emmy winner is streaming now. Praised by CNET's Aaron Pruner as a ""brilliant new take on the anti-hero story,"" Netflix's Ripley is the latest book-to-screen adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel character. Andrew Scott plays the cunning Tom Ripley, a stylish con-man who uses morally sketchy methods to get what he wants -- even murder. Pulling from League of Legends lore, Arcane stands out as an animated fantasy series about socioeconomic inequalities in Piltover and Zaun. Corruption, violence and more are explored in the show through the characters' journeys. Season 1 is available now with season 2 due out in three parts starting Nov. 9. Peaky Blinders tells the story of an English gang run by Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) and his family after World War I. The gang controls the city of Birmingham, but Shelby begins to set his sights beyond the streets as he aims to move up in the world. What sells this show is not only its compelling storyline, but also its stellar casting. For fans of period dramas -- and crime shows -- Peaky Blinders is a must-watch. A word of caution, though: This gritty series is not for the squeamish. Black Mirror is a dark, dystopian imagining of a world overrun by technology and modern ""advancements."" A series of standalone episodes each depict their own compelling -- and often unsettling -- imagining of the impact of our increasingly digital lives. (The anthology format itself can be a refreshing way to consume television in the age of binge-watching.) It will haunt and entertain you in all the best ways. Season 7 will arrive in 2025, and creatorCharlie Brooker saidthat some new episodes are ""deeply unpleasant."" The Great British Baking Show (a.k.a. The Great British Bake-Off) has become synonymous with comfort television, and it continues to deliver all the feel-good vibes. New-ish host Alison Hammond, who joined last season, has proven to be a wonderful addition to the existing cast, which also includes co-host Noel Fielding and judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood. The competition show features 12 bakers engaging in a series of three baking challenges each week, and though the latest season just ended (perhaps a bit controversially!) there are also seven other seasons that offer cozy comfort to check out too. Netflix's new star-studded crime dramedy features an all-star ensemble, including Ray Romano, Lisa Kudrow, Luke Wilson, Dennis Leary, Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, and Linda Cardellini. (The show was created by Liz Feldman, who previously created the darkly comedic Dead To Me, which also co-starred Cardellini.) The new series is about a couple, Lydia and Paul (Kudrow and Romano), whose newly-listed L.A. home has created a frenzy of competition from house hunters – however, there are quite a few secrets... and maybe bodies – buried there. This comedy-drama follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), a college dropout with no legal experience who manages to land a job at the law firm of one of New York's top attorneys, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). They become a powerful team, but have to keep Mike's lack of legal credentials under wraps. A testament to Suits' brilliance is that it became the most-watched acquired series when it hit Netflix in 2023. (The star power of now-Duchess Meghan Markle, who plays paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, was likely also a factor.) All seasons are streaming on the platform now. If you're on TikTok, you've probably seen this one all over your feed. One Day is a heart-wrenching adaptation of David Nicholls' novel, in which we see Emma Morley (Ambika Mod) and Dexter Mayhew (Leo Woodall) reunite on the same day across two decades. It's a unique storytelling device that'll make you reflect on time and relationships, and pull at your heartstrings all the while. This thriller was all anyone talked about when it debuted, and for good reason. Hundreds of people in desperate need of cash compete in a series of games that become a fight for survival. If you can handle the grotesque and gory themes throughout this show, it's an enthralling watch. Then you can eagerly awaitseason 2. A road rage incident between Danny Cho (Steven Yeun) and Amy Lau (Ali Wong) turns into a drawn-out feud, setting the stage for an enthralling comedic drama made all the better by stellar casting. Beef stole the show at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, nabbing eight wins, and won all three categories it was nominated for at the 81st Golden Globe Awards. Griselda Blanco Restrepo was a ruthless Colombian drug lord who was  instrumental in setting up narcotics trade networks to New York and  Miami in the 1970s and '80s. Her violent, tragedy-filled life is the  basis for this six-part Netflix original series, which debuted in  January of 2024. Modern Family star Sofia Vergara plays Blanco, who took  her ""Godmother"" nickname so seriously that she actually named one of  her children Michael Corleone Blanco. Helmed by Colombian director  Andrés Baiz and produced by the team behind Narcos, it's a classic  rise-and-fall crime drama. Vergara's performance won plenty of  critical praise and earned her an Emmy nomination. Political drama The Diplomat, which stars Keri Russell as an American diplomat named Kate Wyler in London, returned this fall with its second pulse-pounding season. The show's first season, which premiered in 2023, is eight episodes, and season 2 is even shorter, coming in at six episodes, making it the perfect weekend binge if you're looking for a show that combines action-packed international intrigue and political thrills with soapy marital drama. Stranger Things is an enthralling medley of horror, drama and nostalgia. Set in the 1980s in fictional small-town Indiana, residents begin experiencing a series of odd events, including the disappearance of a young boy, and begin to search for answers. In this riveting Spanish crime drama, a mastermind called ""The Professor"" assembles a group of eight people to carry out an ambitious robbery of the Royal Mint of Spain. The show uses compelling flashbacks and time jumps to keep you on your toes. Ted Danson has become a sitcom legend for his roles in Cheers, Becker, and The Good Place, and his latest role, in Netflix's A Man On The Inside, keeps that reputation intact. Danson has teamed up again with Good Place showrunner Mike Schur for this new comedy about a widowed retiree named Charles whose desire to find a new hobby lands him a job as a spy for a local private investigator. His assignment? To infiltrate a San Francisco retirement home to find out who's been stealing from the residents. The problem is that Charles, affable and amiable as he is, keeps making friends with all the suspects. The eight-episode show shot to the top of Netflix's Top Ten when it was released in November 2024 and is the perfect comfort binge. One of the most aesthetically pleasing shows on this list. Bridgerton is set in Regency-era England as the Bridgerton siblings search for love while navigating high society -- and being the subject of anonymously penned gossip pamphlets. There's plenty of drama, beautiful costumes and lavish tea parties to keep you coming back for more. The first installment of season 3 arrives on May 16, so catch up now. Gabriel Basso stars in The Night Agent, based on the novel of the same name written by Matthew Quirk. In the show's first season, FBI agent Peter Sutherland (Basso) works at the White House in the top secret Night Agent program, where he gets pulled into a dangerous conspiracy when he learns a mole might be lurking within the government. The show's second season will arrive on Jan. 23, 2025. The new spy thriller Black Doves only just arrived to the platform last week, but it quickly shot into the Netflix Top 10 and has already been renewed for a second season. The addictive series stars Keira Knightly -- who just received a Golden Globe nomination for the role -- as a spy named Helen Webb married to a politician in the British government who has no idea about her true identity. Ben Whishaw plays Helen's friend and associate Sam, an assassin battling his own sense of morality, in this action-packed (and admittedly very bloody) series filled with espionage and occasionally some very dark humor.","From Emmy winners to addictive competition shows, check out one of these binge-worthy shows on Netflix.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-tv-shows-netflix-2024/,

303,"As a VPN Expert, These Are the VPNs I Recommend for NFL Streaming","We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. What to consider in a VPN for streaming NFL games Streaming capabilities Not all VPNs are equal when it comes to how adept they are at unblocking geo-restricted streaming content. To be fair, streaming is not a high priority for every VPN. You’ll want a VPN with a strong track record when it comes to streaming if you want consistent and reliable access to services that stream NFL games. Server locations If you’re in the US and have a subscription to NFL Sunday Ticket, you’ll want a VPN that has servers in various US regions so you have options to tune into your local broadcast. Otherwise, if you subscribe to a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV or DirecTV then you can connect to servers in other locations to access regional broadcasts. Speed Using a VPN will slow your internet speeds somewhat, but if you have a fast VPN (100Mbps or more), you probably won’t even notice a difference as long as your base internet speeds are fast to begin with. If your VPN is slowing your speeds too much, your NFL streaming experience may be choppy. A fast VPN will ensure that the stream remains uninterrupted and you don’t miss a second of the action. Privacy Privacy is an important consideration for any VPN, whether you’re a casual user or have critical online privacy needs. Look for a VPN with AES 256-bit encryption, DNS leak protection and a kill switch -- at a minimum. This will help boost your privacy and ensure your online activity remains private. Price Some VPNs cost $100 or more per year, but you can get premium VPN services that are great for streaming NFL games for as low as $40 per year. Privacy protection and transparency SCORE If you’re looking for thebest VPN for streamingthe NFL, as well as pretty much anything else you want to stream, thenExpressVPNis the one for you. ExpressVPN’s smooth interface requires zero learning curve and delivers a consistent experience across a variety of platforms, making it a solid choice for anyone new to VPNs. You can use ExpressVPN onsmart TVs, Apple TV andFire TV Stickif you prefer watching games on the big screen. Alternatively, you can also use ExpressVPN on your laptop ormobile deviceif you want to stream NFL games on the go. Its speeds weren’t quite as fast as other competitors like NordVPN and Surfshark, but ExpressVPN’s speed performance is still plenty fast enough for a smooth streaming experience, as long as your base internet speeds are above 60Mbps or so. With ExpressVPN, you’ll get access to a large network of servers in 105 countries worldwide, including in 18 cities across the US -- which gives you plenty of options to access out-of-market NFL games. In addition to being excellent for streaming, ExpressVPN is a solid VPN for protecting your privacy online. It’s equipped with AES 256-bit encryption, along with akill switch, DNS leak protection and a RAM-only server infrastructure. ExpressVPN also promises to keep no logs of your internet activity while connected to its network. Its app security and no-logs claims areindependently auditedon a regular basis, which provides additional peace of mind that your data is safe. It’s a top VPN, but it’s also one of the most expensive on the market at $13 per month, $60 every six months or $100 per year. If you’re not satisfied with the service, you can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfsharkis a great choice if you’re looking for a VPN with a premium feel at a budget price. It’s also one of thefastest VPNsand offers more than 3,200 servers in 100 countries, including in 22 different US cities. Surfshark is excellent for streaming NFL games, as well as for streaming your favorite movies and shows on other platforms likeNetflix, Hulu and Disney Plus. The app is easy to use across all platforms, including on mobile, laptop, smart TVs and streaming devices. Surfshark offers some pretty cool and unique privacy features that make it a solid choice for folks who want to add additional layers of privacy to their VPN experience. In addition to standard VPN privacy features like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, Surfshark has an IP rotator feature that changes your IP address every couple of minutes without breaking the VPN tunnel, a Dynamic Multihop feature that lets you double-VPN through any two servers you want and an Alternative ID feature that generates a fake persona (complete with a full name, email address and physical address) that you can use to protect your true identity when signing up for online services. Although Surfshark’s monthly plan is expensive at $15.45 per month, its longer-term plan prices are some of the cheapest in the industry. The yearly plan costs $45 for the first year (then $60 annually) and the two-year plan costs $60 total for the first 27 months (then $60 annually). Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPNis currently the fastest VPN based on our latest speed tests. So if you want the fastest VPN for streaming NFL games, then NordVPN is a solid bet. NordVPN is also a great choice for NFL fans who want access to a huge network of servers, thanks to the VPN’s 6,000-plus servers in 111 countries (including in 15 different US cities). It’s an excellent VPN for streaming international content from around the globe as well as for catching NFL action stateside. With NordVPN, you’ll be able to stream NFL games on your computer or mobile device, as well as across a range of smart TVs and streaming devices, including Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire TV Stick. Like Surfshark, NordVPN also includes a few unique extras with its VPN service. NordVPN’s Meshnet feature allows you to create your own VPN server, securely share files with others and set up a remote local area network for gaming with friends or collaborating with classmates or colleagues. You’ll also get Tor over VPN (which leverages the Onion network for an additional layer of privacy) multi-hop connections and obfuscation, in addition to standard VPN privacy protections like a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a no-logs policy. Although NordVPN offers attractive introductory prices, its renewal prices balloon to the most expensive annual rate out of any VPN on this list. The monthly plan costs $13 per month, the annual plan costs $60 for the first year (then $140 per year) and the two-year plan costs $83 total for the first two years (then $140 per year). Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE One unique aspect ofPrivate Internet Accessis that it has servers in every single US state, which makes it a good choice for folks who want to unblock specific local broadcasts onYouTube TVor similar live TV streaming platforms. Using PIA might not be quite as straightforward as ExpressVPN, but once you get the hang of it, it’s pretty easy. I like how you can customize and fine-tune the look and feel of the app itself as well as the level of encryption you want. This lets you dial in exactly what you want at your fingertips as you use the app and allows you to prioritize things like privacy or speed. PIA’s apps are available on Android TV, Apple TV, Fire TV Stick and laptops and mobile devices, giving you options to stream whether you’re on your couch or out and about. One downside is that PIA’s speed performance was disappointing in our latest round of testing, cutting our base internet speeds in half. That shouldn’t be an issue if your internet speeds are fast enough to begin with (ideally somewhere above 100Mbps), but it could cause interruptions in your streaming experience if your regular network connection is on the slow end. PIA offers industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption, DNS leak protection, a kill switch and a no-logs policy to keep your online activities private. You’ll also get additional features like obfuscation,split tunneling, multihop connections and an ad and malware blocker. It’s a solid VPN overall -- despite the lackluster speed performance -- and it’sone of the cheapestaround, at $12 per month, $40 per year or $79 every three years. The annual and three-year plans include 500GB of cloud storage per year at no additional cost. ExpressVPNis currently the best VPN for streaming NFL games, thanks to its excellent unblocking capabilities and smooth interface across platforms. ExpressVPN's app is clean and easy to use. Surfsharkis one of the best VPNs for streaming and is great for anyone looking for a top VPN at a budget-friendly price. Surfshark's app delivers tons of features at a budget-friendly price. NordVPNis the fastest VPN for streaming NFL games and offers a ton of server locations around the world and in 15 US cities. NordVPN offers servers in more locations than most VPNs. PIAis another solid choice for streaming NFL games because it has servers in every US state, which can be beneficial if you’re looking to access a specific city’s local broadcast. PIA's apps offer a lot of options for customization I remember a time when all I needed to do to watch NFL football was to flip on my television and tune to one of four or five channels. I’d throw a couple of logs on the fireplace and settle in for a full slate of Sunday NFL programming without needing to decipher how to watch the games I wanted to watch. These days, it seems like there aredozens of available options for streaming NFL games, with things getting increasingly complicated every year as additional streaming services enter the fray to secure exclusive rights to high-profile matchups. Although there are more options to watch more games than ever before, the overall streaming experience is not what I would consider even remotely fan-friendly. This is thanks to the highly fragmented nature of the NFL streaming landscape. These days, you need to be a paying subscriber to at least three different individual streaming platforms in addition to a live television streaming platform that covers all of your local network and cable stations if you want to watch the games available in your region. It takes a lot towatch the NFL in 2024, but using aVPNto stream NFL games can help maximize your streaming capabilities and get you access to even more matchups by routing your internet connection through a different location. Depending on what streaming service you use to watch NFL games, you may only have access to out-of-market matchups or you may only have access to the matchups available on your local network stations. Week 16 in the NFL has no shortage of compelling games, including the New York Giants at the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday afternoon on Fox, and the Jacksonville Jaguars at the Las Vegas Raiders on CBS. With a VPN, you can have your pick of whichever game you'd like to watch. Although VPNs are designed mainly to protect your privacy online, many people use them to access geographically restricted streaming content. Because a VPN can make it look like you’re using the internet in a different region, your NFL streaming options aren’t limited by your physical location, so you can theoretically watch any live NFL game you want when connected to a VPN. So whether you’re managing multiple fantasy football teams, wagering on the action, avoiding TV blackouts, streaming your home teamfrom abroador just a casual fan who likes to watch a ton of football, a VPN is an immensely useful addition to your digital toolbox. Not all VPNs perform equally when it comes to streaming -- whether that's NFL games or movies and shows. Based on my decade of experience using, testing and researching VPNs, I recommend using one of the VPNs listed above for streaming NFL games because of each provider's excellent unblocking capabilities and superb performance across operating systems and streaming devices. Just remember to check the terms of service for any streaming service to make sure location-changing isn’t a violation of their terms. Based on my years oftesting various VPN products, these are the most important factors to consider when choosing a VPN for streaming NFL games. Streaming capabilities Not all VPNs are equal when it comes to how adept they are at unblocking geo-restricted streaming content. To be fair, streaming is not a high priority for every VPN. Some VPNs put a strong focus on streaming because they know that many of their customers sign up to stream content from different regions. Others may focus more on privacy or otherwise may not have the resources to deliver reliable streaming performance. Either way, you’ll want a VPN with a strong track record when it comes to streaming if you want consistent and reliable access to services that stream NFL games. Server locations If you’re in the US and have a subscription to NFL Sunday Ticket, you’ll want a VPN that has servers in various US regions. This is because NFL Sunday Ticket only gives you access to out-of-market NFL matchups. So if you want to watch your local matchup, you’ll need to connect to a server outside of your current region. Otherwise, if you subscribe to a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV or DirecTV then you can connect to servers in other locations to access regional broadcasts. The more server locations you have at your disposal (especially in the US) the more options you have for streaming NFL games. Speed Using a VPN will slow your internet speeds somewhat, but if you have a fast VPN (100Mbps or more), you probably won’t even notice a difference as long as your base internet speeds are fast to begin with. If your VPN is slowing your speeds too much, your NFL streaming experience may be choppy. A fast VPN will ensure that the stream remains uninterrupted and you don’t miss a second of the action. For optimal speed performance, I recommend using the WireGuardprotocolor your VPN provider’s proprietary protocol. Privacy Privacy is an important consideration for any VPN, whether you’re a casual user or have critical online privacy needs. Look for a VPN with AES 256-bit encryption, DNS leak protection and a kill switch -- at a minimum. This will help boost your privacy and ensure your online activity remains private. Price The price of the VPN service will be a major consideration for most people. Some VPNs cost $100 or more per year, but you can get premium VPN services that are great for streaming NFL games for as low as $40 per year. Technically, you could.Don’t count on free VPNs being very effectiveat delivering a satisfying streaming experience. Most free VPNs impose strict usage limitations that make them basically useless for streaming. Even with a “generous” 10GB per month data allowance, you might be able to stream one game per month -- and that’s if the speeds are fast enough for streaming. Besides having limitations, some free VPNs are dangerous to use because they may sell your data or even be infected with malware. At CNET, the onlyfree VPNwe recommend isProton VPN’s free tier, which doesn’t include any usage or speed limitations. On Proton VPN’s free tier, you cannot manually select the server location to connect to, so it may take you a few attempts to even get connected to a US server to stream NFL games. There’s no shortage ofstreaming services that offer NFL broadcasts, and it can be overwhelming to even wrap your head around all of the different options. Some notable options include Peacock, Paramount Plus, ESPN Plus, Amazon Prime Video, NFL Plus, NFL Sunday Ticket, RedZone and Netflix. There are also live TV streaming services like Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV, Sling and Fubo that also broadcast regional coverage of NFL games.  No, you don’t need a VPN to stream NFL games. You can stream NFL games using any number of streaming services that broadcast the NFL. If you don’t want to stream at all, you can just stick with traditional cable or get an antenna to pick up your local broadcast channels and watch the old-fashioned way. If you want to open up your NFL streaming options and access matchups you wouldn’t normally have access to, a VPN can help. ",Using a VPN can help maximize your NFL livestreaming experience for Week 16.

304,Best VPN for Chrome 2024,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. Factors consider in a VPN for Chrome  Platform compatibility Most VPN providers offer plugins for Chrome and other web browsers, but a VPN browser extension only works with that browser. Nearly all VPN providers offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS/iPadOS so you can encrypt your Chrome browser traffic and all other apps on your device. Privacy At a minimum, we recommend AES 256-bit encryption for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols, and ChaCha20 for WireGuard. You should also select a VPN provider with a strict no-logs policy and annual audits to verify its zero-log claims. Speed All VPN providers lower your internet speeds somewhat. The fastest VPNs only slow down your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less -- with the best-performing VPNs dipping your internet speed just an average of 11% or so. Server network You'll want to consider the overall number of servers that a VPN company operates as well as the number of different countries. Most of our top VPN choices feature thousands of servers spread throughout 100-plus countries. Streaming While VPNs are privacy tools, many folks use them to access geo-restricted content like foreign Netflix libraries. You'll want to consider how many streaming services a VPN unblocks as well as its internet speed loss, which can impact video quality while streaming. Price A VPN subscription runs you anywhere from around $10 to $15 per month. You can save with a one-, two- or three-year deal. Often, annual VPN subscriptions run anywhere from $40 to $100 per year. Privacy protection and transparency SCORE ExpressVPNis our favorite VPN for Chrome and our Editors’ Choice for the best VPN on the planet. You can use the Google Chrome browser extension or its Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS apps. Because of itssplittunnelingcapabilities, you can select only Google Chrome or a handful of apps to route through your VPN when using your device’s native VPN app. Granted, we experienced a serious DNS leak issue using some split-tunneling settings on Windows PCs, although the problem was confined to what Express estimates as 1% or fewer of its users. Additionally, ExpressVPN’s swift action in fixing the issue and publishing ablog postfor transparency impressed us. Aside from its Chrome plugin, you’ll find extensions for other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Vivaldi and Edge. Uniquely, ExpressVPN’s browser plugin is essentially a remote in-browser control for the desktop app. Unlike Nord, Surfshark and other VPNs, Express requires installing the desktop app in conjunction with its browser extension. We actually appreciate that it provides the full slate of app features like split tunneling, but it’s not ideal for a situation where you just want a fast browser-only VPN install -- like if you’re at the public library and want a private internet session. We appreciate that ExpressVPN is fast, secure and feature-packed. While all VPNs throttle your internet connection somewhat, Express’s reasonable 24.8% average speed loss is slower than NordVPN’s unrivaled 11.1% and Surfshark’s impressive 17%, although nearly unnoticeably so. Even for bandwidth-intensive applications like competitive gaming or 4Kvideo streaming, Express doesn’t bat an eye. In our experience, we had no issues streaming from Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video -- all of which worked on U.S. and many international servers. Express doesn’t compromise on privacy or transparency, either. ItsTrustedServer technologywipes your data after every VPN session to reduce the likelihood of sensitive data leaking. Additionally, Express underwent an astounding 12 independent audits in 2022 alone, showcasing its commitment to transparency. ExpressVPN’s user-friendly apps don’t compromise on functionality, boasting features including a kill switch and split tunneling. Its impressive 3,000-plus server network covers 105 countries, which is near the top of the pack. While some rivals like Surfshark, Proton VPN and NordVPN offer more overall servers, few feature the individual country diversity of Express. Unfortunately, you’ll pay a premium for ExpressVPN’s class-leading service. At $13 per month, $100 for the first year (then $117 per year) or $140 total for two years (then $150 per year), it’s one of the priciest VPNs on the market. At that cost, we’d like more than eight simultaneous connections. For comparison, Express delivers two fewer than NordVPN’s 10 and considerably less than Surfshark’s unlimited allowance. Granted, you do get some extra goodies for that price, including a password manager and identity theft protection. Nevertheless, ExpressVPN’s exceptional balance of speed, features, beginner-friendly apps and streaming compatibility makes it the greatest VPN for most folks. Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPNis blisteringly fast, private and excellent for entertainment. If you want to stream 4K movies on Disney Plus, hop on Zoom calls or play online multiplayer games, NordVPN is a great choice that won't noticeably slow down your internet connection. You can install the Google Chrome browser extension or use one of its dedicated apps for Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS and other platforms. Aside from its Chrome plugin, Nord offers Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox plugins. The plugin boasts a kill switch and split tunneling at the domain level, so you can exclude certain websites or IP addresses in your browser. Its Quick Connect feature tunnels you through an optimal server, and auto-connect starts your VPN when you fire up your browser. You can halt WebRTC leaks to protect your IP address from exposure and toggle on threat protection which blocks harmful websites or ads. Nord touts an exceptionally low 11% internet speed loss, which trounces the competition. Combined with its superb geo-protected content unblocking, which works with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus and a slew of other services, Nord is an excellent VPN for streaming. Moreover, NordVPN’s bevy of privacy features makes it a solid choice for security-minded users. You’ll find the typical VPN trappings, including a kill switch, split tunneling, AES 256-bit encryption (with OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols), ChaCha20 encryption using the WireGuard VPN protocol and a strict no-logging policy. Additionally, Nord boasts a double VPN and Onion Over VPN, both adding an extra layer of encryption, making it harder to determine your IP address. Nord’s beefed-up privacy features are great for folks with serious privacy concerns such as investigative journalists. Setting you back $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for your first two years, NordVPN’s one- or two-year plans initially save you money compared to providers like ExpressVPN. Its annual and bi-annual plans jump to $140 a year after your initial introductory pricing. Despite its wallet-friendly nature, we don’t recommend the two-year subscription because of how fast the VPN space changes. Your fast, secure VPN might suffer a data breach or struggle to stream foreign Netflix libraries after a year. NordVPN remains an excellent option for anyone with serious privacy needs or demanding internet requirements, like 4K streaming andgaming. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfshark’s Chrome extension is functionally and visually very similar to its apps across other platforms, soSurfsharkusers will feel right at home using the extension. Choosing a server location is simple, and the extension establishes the connection immediately. Although Surfshark’s Chrome extension is not as fully featured as its app, you’ll still have the ability to choose from servers in 100 different countries. You can also use the Quick Connect feature to connect to the fastest location, nearest location or a server of your choosing. Alternatively, you can use the Auto Connect feature to automatically connect to your preferred server location whenever you launch Chrome. This is a good option if you don’t want to risk forgetting to turn your Surfshark on when you open your Chrome browser. Surfshark uses SSL/TLS v1.2 encryption to secure your Chrome browser traffic, and the extension includes a WebRTC blocking feature (enabled by default) to help against WebRTC leaks, which can expose your true IP address. Surfshark’s speeds through its Chrome extension are excellent and plenty fast enough for activities like streaming, video conferencing or gaming. During our tests, we were able to easily access streaming content from various streaming services likeNetflix,Disney PlusandAmazon Prime Video. Additionally, we liked its spectacular 17% average internet speed loss that we clocked in our late 2023 testing, which jostles with thefastest VPNsincluding NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Surfshark is a top-notch VPN provider that’s a solid option for anyoneon a budget, or anyone who owns a lot of devices or lives in a large household. In addition to using its Chrome extension, you’ll be able to connect an unlimited number of devices at once across all major platforms, at a price that’s cheaper than most of the competition. Although Surfshark’s monthly plan is an expensive $15.45 per month, the annual plan offers significant value over the competition at $48 for the first year, then $60 annually after that. If you opt for the two-year plan, you’ll pay $56 for the first two years combined, then $60 annually, although we advise against signing on with any VPN provider for more than a year at a time given how quickly things tend to shift in the VPN industry. Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE Private Internet Accessis an excellent cheap alternative to other budget-friendly VPNs like Surfshark. If you’re on a budget, like to tinker around with customizable app settings and appreciate transparency, then PIA could be a good option for you. PIA’s Chrome extension offers a lot of neat settings that you can play around with to precisely dial in your desired level of privacy. You have the option to enable WebRTC blocking, as well as to block camera, microphone and location access. You can also disable credit card and address autofill in Chrome from PIA’s extension in addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technology. PIA uses TLS v1.3 to encrypt Chrome browser traffic. Our testing uncovered a high average internet speed loss of 49% with PIA. We typically look for 25% loss or less, with the fastest VPN we tested (Nord) delivering a best-in-class 11% speed reduction, and the value-packed Surfshark impressively keeping things to 17%. PIA’s Chrome plugin gives you access to its entire network of server locations in 91 countries. Additional features include split tunneling (which allows you to exclude certain websites from the PIA connection) and Smart Location (which allows you to automatically connect to a specific server location when accessing a specific website). Connection speeds through PIA’s Chrome extension are fast, but its streaming performance was inconsistent during our tests. Streaming Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video content worked fine across most devices, although we encountered some issues with Prime on Windows PCs -- Amazon detected that we were using a VPN. PIA’s Chrome extension is a suitable solution if you’re looking to stream Netflix and Disney Plus, but we’d recommend either trying its full VPN app or another VPN entirely if you want to watch content on other streaming platforms. PIA is one of the cheapest VPNs on this list at $12 per month, $40 a year or $79 every three years. The only free plan we recommend SCORE The Swiss-based Proton AG prides itself on privacy, and its VPN doesn’t disappoint.Proton VPNdelivers the only free VPN we recommend. Its no-cost tier is actually usable, sporting access to over 240 servers across five countries, all without ads, while maintaining fast internet speeds. You can install Proton on Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS and Linux, which even comes with a GUI. Proton’s browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Chromium and other browsers) works for free users as of August 2024 -- previously, Proton VPN's browser plugin was relegated to its paid plan. You can also use Proton’s free tier with Chrome by installing the app for your device. The browser extension offers a Quick Connect option that routes you through an ideal server. Proton VPN’s Chrome plugin lets you enable auto connect to start a VPN your browser opens, split tunneling to exclude websites or IP addresses from using your VPN and WebRTC protection for further hiding your IP address. Aside from access to its browser plugins, the paid Proton VPN Plus options provide advanced privacy features, including Tor over VPN, faster internet speeds, more simultaneous connections and a much larger server network of 9,300-plus servers blanketing 112 countries. At $10 per month, $60 for your first year or $108 total for the first two years of service (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually). Proton is cheaper than premium VPN providers like ExpressVPN, but more expensive than competitors such as PIA and Surfshark. We appreciate its Linux GUI app, which is great for beginners. Its lack of live chat support might let down less tech-savvy users, although a robust selection of help guides somewhat offsets this shortcoming. If you need a VPN for Chrome without spending any money, Proton is a solid pick, so long as you’re OK without a browser plugin. Its paid premium plan is a worthy upgrade for a fast, private VPN solution. The best VPN for Chrome isExpressVPN, which provides blazing-fast internet speeds, excellent region-restricted content unblocking and strong privacy features. If you use ExpressVPN's Chrome plug-in, it allows access to the full slate of ExpressVPN settings, unlike many other VPN browser add-ons. Surfsharkis the best cheap VPN for Chrome with its feature-rich apps, great performance and solid streaming support, although Private Internet Access is a terrific budget pick. NordVPNboasts outstanding privacy and unmatched internet speeds -- Nord is the fastest VPN we tested -- making it a fantastic, reliable VPN. Protonis an exceptional free VPN and the only no-cost option we recommend. PIAis a solid budget-friendly VPN that doesn't break the bank but still delivers a slew of features, like unlimited simultaneous connections, open-source apps and a strong commitment to privacy. For more recommendations to boost your online privacy, check out thebest browser VPNs.  Using avirtual private networkimproves your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your public IP address, keeping your actual location hidden. Having a VPN for Google Chrome stops websites from knowing where you are and your internet service provider from viewing your browsing activity. Using a VPN can also give you access to online content such as geographically restricted foreign TV shows and movies, likeforeign Netflix libraries. Most VPNs provide a Chrome web browser plugin so you can easily keep your internet browsing activity private. You can always use your VPN provider's native app for your device rather than a browser add-on. CNET's experts have thoroughly tested dozens of VPNs over the years, with a heavy focus on factors like privacy features, download speeds, terms of service, streaming videos, app performance and DNS leaks. The best Chrome VPNs spotlighted below offer solid app support features like plugin availability and tunneling. Internet speed, server network size and price also factor into our evaluation process. Here are the best VPNs for Chrome to keep you browsing with privacy. Based on our years of testing and using VPNs across operating systems and browsers, these are the top factors you should consider when choosing a VPN for Chrome: Platform compatibility If you’re looking for a VPN for Chrome, your primary consideration will be whether the VPN offers a Chrome extension. Most of the top VPN providers offer plugins for Chrome and other browsers, but some do not. Check that the VPN you’re considering offers a Chrome extension before purchasing. Alternatively, you can use your VPN provider's native device app for platforms like Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS/iPadOS and Linux, which works with an installed Chrome browser. Privacy A VPN’s Chrome extension doesn’t deliver the same level of privacy that a full VPN app does, but you’ll still get basic privacy protections through the plugin because it provides browser encryption and hides your IP address from the websites you visit. An important privacy feature to look out for in your VPN’s browser extension is WebRTC blocking, which can help prevent your IP address (and location) from leaking to the websites you’re visiting. Speed Because they’re lightweight versions of their respective VPN apps, VPN browser extensions can offer faster speeds than the full VPN app. If you’re streaming, video conferencing or gaming, and only need basic browser privacy, then using the browser extension can be a great way to get faster speeds. Server network A large network of servers can be beneficial, especially if you’re looking to unblock streaming content from around the world. Check the VPN provider’s list of servers to ensure that it offers servers in locations from which you want to stream content. Cost If you’re on a budget, then the price of your VPN will be an important consideration. Most VPNs cost around $10 to $15 per month, but you can enjoy greater savings and an overall better value if you opt for a yearly subscription plan. You can get a budget-friendly VPN for about $40 to $60 a year, but more expensive options can run up to $100 a year. Customer support Most of the best VPNs have helpful customer support options that are available around the clock. If you prefer getting answers from a real human, look for a provider that offers live chat or email support. If you prefer to find help on your own, look for a provider that has an extensive help section/knowledge base on its website that includes FAQs, troubleshooting guides and setup instructions. The maindifference between a VPN browser extension and a VPN appis that the VPN’s Chrome extension will only protect your traffic through the Chrome browser, whereas a VPN app works on the operating system level and will protect all online traffic running through all applications on your device. Be aware that a VPN’s browser extension works essentially like a proxy and doesn’t actually encrypt your traffic through a VPN tunnel. Rather, it creates a secure, encrypted browser connection and changes your IP address to that of the proxy server you’re connecting through. Basically, a VPN browser extension is a stripped-down version of a full VPN app that doesn’t offer the same level of privacy protection and typically doesn’t offer the full suite of features that a VPN app does. A browser extension is a good option if you simply want basic privacy protections and to hide your true IP address while browsing the internet or streaming content through your browser. (It’s also usually faster for streaming due to its lightweight nature.) A VPN browser plugin is also a good option if you just want to run a quick private browsing session on a library computer where you can’t download a full VPN app. If you want the full level of privacy protection offered by your VPN, you should use the VPN provider's app. You can even use your VPN’s app in conjunction with its browser extension to leverage the app’s privacy protections with the browser extension’s browser-specific protections. Additionally, if offered by your VPN provider, you can use the app’ssplit-tunnelingfeature to protect only your Chrome browser traffic through the full VPN tunnel. If you want to add privacy to other browsers, you can check out thebest browser VPNs. The open-source engineChromiumpowers Google Chrome, along with several other browsers, including Brave, Vivaldi, Opera and Edge. Luckily, your VPN provider probably offers a browser extension for other Chromium-based web browsers. For example, ExpressVPN features plugins for Google Chrome, Brave and Edge. You can typically find a plugin in the Chrome app store that works on your preferred Chromium browser. I easily added the ExpressVPN plugin to Brave and Edge, for instance. Even if your VPN provider doesn’t advertise a plugin on its website, we recommend checking the Chrome store in your Chromium-powered browser of choice. Whenevaluating the best VPNs for Chrome, we thoroughly tested each VPN provider’s Chrome extension. We evaluated things like available features, speeds, streaming capabilities, ease of use, privacy/security and overall value. Each VPN listed above offers an excellent Chrome extension, but you may find one particular option better suited to your needs than another, whether you’re looking to stream content through Chrome, or simply want general privacy while browsing the internet. IPVanishdoesn’t offer a Chrome extension, or any browser extension for that matter (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). If you’re a Windows or Android user, you can use IPVanish’ssplit-tunnelingfeature to cover only your Chrome browser traffic, if that’s what you’re after. It’s not as convenient as using an actual VPN browser extension, but it’s an option if you’re set on using IPVanish's service. IPVanish is otherwise a capable VPN provider that offers easy-to-use apps and unlimited simultaneous connections for $13 per month, $40 for the first year (then $90 annually) or $53 for the first two years combined (then $90 annually). Its high average internet speed loss of 44% makes it a tough recommendation. Read our IPVanish review. Yes, VPNs work with Google Chrome using a browser extension or native app for your device’s operating system. The best free VPN for Chrome -- and the only no-cost VPN we recommend -- is Proton. With Proton VPN, you’ll enjoy fast speeds, a modest server network and solid security on the free tier, all without ads. While its browser extension is limited to the paid premium plan, you can still use Proton VPN’s app on your device with Chrome, making it the best 100% free VPN. No, Google Chrome doesn’t have a built-in VPN, although you can easily install your VPN provider’s browser extension or app. Yes, it is safe to add a VPN extension to a Google Chrome web browser, but we recommend using your VPN provider's official browser extension rather than a third-party option.","The best VPNs for Google Chrome, let you unblock geographical restrictions and add a layer of privacy to your browser using a browser plug-in or native device app.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-chrome/,
305,iPhone 17 Rumors: Everything We Could See With Apple's Next Flagship Device,"TheiPhone 16is still only a few months old, but that doesn't stop the rumor mill from churning out speculation about Apple's upcoming devices. There's already been plenty of buzz about what we could see with the nextiPhone, likely called the iPhone 17, next fall, from a slimmer version of the flagship handset to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on the baseline models. Here's what analysts are predicting about the iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to be announced around September 2025 -- but it's never too early to speculate. One of the biggest rumors surrounds a possibleiPhone ""Slim,""a thinner version of Apple's flagship device that would replace the iPhone Plus option. It could feature a 6.6-inch screen, making it slightly smaller than theiPhone 16 PlusandiPhone 16 Pro Maxbut still bigger than the baseline model, according to analystsJeff PuandMing-Chi Kuo. The thinner phone could also feature an aluminum-based frame, Pu and Kuo have each suggested. This wouldn't be much of a leap, since Apple added a polished aluminum finish to theApple Watch Series 10. To slim down a device, there will need to be hardware tradeoffs, and that may include thephone's camera. It's possible this version of the iPhone 17 would only have one main camera, Kuo speculates, doing without the ultrawide and 5x telephoto lenses that have been staples of Apple's premium iPhones for years. This would place the slim iPhone in the same camp as the $429iPhone SEwhen it comes to cameras, as thatphoneonly has one rear lens as well. The good news, though, is that the selfie camera on the iPhone Slim could get a boost; more on that later. When it comes to what's on the inside, the iPhone 17 Slim will likely feature an A18 or A19-branded chip, Pu suggests. This would reportedly match the chip in the baseline iPhone 17. It could also include 8GB of RAM and, potentially, anApple-developed 5G modem. What remains to be seen is what battery capacity could look like. A slimmer build typically means less space for the battery and, by extension, potentially a compromise on battery life. Hopefully, that's not the case here, but we'll have to see. Rumor has it all models of the iPhone 17 will feature a 120Hz display, bumping the non-Pro models up from their current60Hz refresh rate. That could be awelcome change, as the discrepancy between the Pro and non-Pro refresh rate is surprising; when Apple debuted the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a 60Hz display, there was a bit of an outcry from folks who expected more in 2024. This rumored update could remedy that. It's not an iPhone release without a camera upgrade. The biggest rumor so far is that the selfie camera on all iPhone 17 models, including the Slim, will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, Pu reports. That's a decent bump from the current 12-megapixel front-facing camera on the iPhone 16 lineup, though it's important to remember that more megapixels doesn't automatically mean better photos. Still, given how much people increasingly rely on their front cameras to snap selfies and record videos for TikTok and Instagram, this is sure to be a welcome advancement. While rumor has it the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Slim and iPhone 17 Pro will all have an aluminum design, Pu suggests the iPhone 17 Pro Max will maintain a titanium frame. Additionally, the iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to a smaller Face ID sensor. Dynamic Island on other iPhone 17 models would reportedly stay the same size, Pu says. We'll continue to update this piece as more rumors surface, so be sure to follow along.",A slimmer iPhone and selfie camera improvements could be on the way.

306,Want to Save Your iPhone Battery? Kill These 2 iOS Settings,"Your iPhone'sLow Power Modewarning is always frustrating, especially if you're out of the house and don't have a charger. In the worst-case scenario, if yourphone runs out of battery, you won't be able to call an Uber or look for directions to get home. Luckily, you can adjust some settings in iOS to help prevent your device from running out of juice when you need it most. You can also keep an eye on yourBattery Health menu-- it'll tell you your battery health percentage (80% or higher is considered good), as well as show you how many times you've cycled your battery and whether or not your battery is ""normal."" We'll show you two iOS features that both put a strain on your iPhone's battery to varying degrees and how you can turn them off to help preserve battery life. Here's what you need to know. If you want more battery saving tips and tricks, check outhow to stop background apps from refreshingandhow to replace your iPhone's battery (cheaper than Apple). All the widgets on your lock screen force your apps to automatically run in the background, constantly fetching data to update the information the widgets display, like sports scores or the weather. Because these apps are constantly running in the background due to your widgets, that means they continuously drain power. If you want to help preserve some battery on iOS 18, the best thing to do is simply avoid widgets on your lock screen (and home screen). The easiest way to do this is to switch to another lock screen profile: Press your finger down on your existing lock screen and then swipe around to choose one that doesn't have any widgets. If you want to just remove the widgets from your existing lock screen, press down on your lock screen, hitCustomize, choose theLock Screenoption, tap on the widget box and then hit the""—"" buttonon each widget to remove them. If you're already low on battery, it's best to just switch to a wallpaper that doesn't have lock screen widgets. Surprisingly, the keyboard on the iPhone has never had the ability to vibrate as you type, an addition called ""haptic feedback"" that was added to iPhones with iOS 16. Instead of just hearing click-clack sounds, haptic feedback gives each key a vibration, providing a more immersive experience as you type. According to Apple, the very same feature may also affect battery life. According to thisApple support pageabout the keyboard, haptic feedback ""might affect the battery life of your iPhone."" No specifics are given as to how much battery life the keyboard feature drains, but if you want to conserve battery, it's best to keep this feature disabled. Fortunately, it is not enabled by default. If you've enabled it yourself, go toSettings>Sounds & Haptics>Keyboard Feedbackand toggle offHapticto turn off haptic feedback for your keyboard.

307,"How to Use an AI Voice Changer, and What It Offers Content Creators","Not long ago, I was watching a movie where the sound of the antagonist's voice annoyed me, and while I couldn't do anything about that movie, it got me thinking: If I'm creating content, how do I get the voice that I'm looking for? One option isAI. AI voiceover generators could come in handy for content creation with a low budget, like social media posts and YouTube videos. They could also be an accessibility solution for those with visual impairments. I foundArtlist, a hub of digital assets and tools for creators, in a long list of AI-powered voiceover generators (looking at you,Speechify,Rebind,Murf AI,ElevenLabsandWellSaid). What originally stood out to me about the company was its ethical, artist-first approach to content: Artlist's roster of more than 200 musicians receive compensation for their work — about 2,000 tracks a year alongside existing voiceovers across music and video categories — as well as a share of revenue. Founded in 2016 by self-taught filmmakerIra Belsky, the technology company originally launched to support the gap between high-quality music at an affordable cost. In November 2023, Artlist launched its voiceover tool with artificial intelligence as the driver. The voiceover tool's capabilities include a catalog of various voices and text-to-speech functionality. Today, the company offers four features on its site: Artist-created music and special effects, AI voiceovers for video content creators, story footage from filmmakers, and Lookup Tables (photography color filters). While I'm not a content creator, I (apparently) have opinions on how sound integrates into visual forms of storytelling. With Artlist, I could explore the possibilities of different voices — and music — within content.  You can choose accent, speed and emotion for your AI-generated VoiceOver. Step 1:Navigate toArtlist's homepageand access a free version of the subscription, which provides you with a small taste of everything within its premium plan ($35 per month). This will give you access to 400 words of voiceover creation — about three sentences — before needing to upgrade to a voiceover plan ($12 per month) or a premium plan. Step 2:From the left side of the screen, chooseVoiceoverand Artlist's voice catalog will open. Here, you can browse and filter by category and gender. (At time of publishing, only male and female options were available.) Step 3:Above the catalog, a text box is available to create your own voice over. Type the text you want to generate into speech. One character equals one credit. If on a voiceover or premium plan, you can type up to 2,000 characters for each generation. Step 4: Next, locate the three drop-down menus below the text box for customization. Choose your country of origin, including whatever accent you want, voiceover speed and emotional tone, which has the most robust of choices, including emotions likeOptimistic,SadandSurprised. Step 5: Click theGeneratebutton on the bottom right corner and give it a few seconds to create. Your file will show up below the voiceover generator box, and under the tabMy Voiceoversdirectly below it. You can download your file, get AI-powered content suggestions or add to an existing or newArtboard, Artlist's AI-powered asset organization tool. If you're having trouble with Artlist's voice-over generator, there are resources available to help, including anAI voiceover guide,tips to generate voiceoversand variousvoiceover blog posts. Artlist stands out for its digestible learning curve and a more seamless integration into media projects. I appreciate its straightforward interface — one that didn't take ample time to understand its landscape. Where its competitors like Murf AI and ElevenLabs focus on the quantity and types of voices available for its users, Artlist focuses on the production quality of its audio assets. (Shouldn't quality always supersede quantity?) Yet, since Artlist focuses more on text-to-speech, its $12 voiceover plan (billed annually) isn't as bundled or robust as its competitors. Artlist has a vast library of multimedia voices that can replace the voices in your library — but while there's an option to alter emotion across a ""natural voice"" spectrum, it lacks the natural-sounding voices and voice-cloning capabilities that other tools already have. If you're a content creator seeking royalty-free music and sound effects — with the option to utilize its AI voiceover feature — then Artlist is a choice for bolstering your needs. (Or to bundle into a content creator-focused premium plan, $35 per month billed annually.) But for creatives that fit into a broader range of work, Artlist, while polished, could be too niche for your needs.","Yet another artificial intelligence voiceover and text-to-speech tool, Artlist could be a nice addition for content creators specifically.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-use-an-ai-voice-changer-and-what-it-offers-content-creators/,
308,Not Into Charlie Brown? Get Into This Offbeat Kids' Christmas Special Instead,"There's plenty of holiday-themed programming to dig into during this festive season. You've got theCharlie Brown Christmasspecial at Apple TV Plus andSabrina Carpenter's recently released variety show on Netflix. But if you're interested in an outside-of-the-box idea that you can view with the youngsters in your life, I have a suggestion. Why not watch Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse instead? Yes, I am telling you to go ahead and enjoy an episode of Pee-wee's Playhouse — that wild, off-kilter, Emmy-winning children's show. Just hear me out. If you need a refresher, Pee-wee's Playhouse was inspired by the gray suit–clad, hyperenergetic man-child character created by Paul Reubens.Pee-wee Hermanwas introduced to audiences everywhere with Tim Burton's feature film debut, Pee-wee's Big Adventure. From there, Pee-wee became a household name. That movie spawned a sequel, Pee-wee hosted an episode of SNL, and his Saturday morning children's show on CBS won 15 Emmys during its five-year run. He was so popular that the JCPenney department store even had its ownPee-wee clothing line. Read more:Break From Basic Christmas Movies and Watch These Alternatives Instead Season 3 of Pee-wee's Playhouse saw the show at its peak popularity. It was the season that introduced this subversive and festive holiday special to young eyes everywhere. I was 12 years old on Dec. 21, 1988, when the episode premiered on CBS. You best believe this was appointment television in my household. Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse is a variety special that throws it back a bit to the classic holiday variety shows of the '60s and '70s. Nearly an hour long, the holiday variety special runs the gamut from doling out educational tidbits for kids to lobbing a cornucopia of innuendos for the adults to eat up, while topping it all with a heaping helping of pop culture schlock and heartwarming nostalgia. There's a plotline threading it all together, but it's the least important aspect of the whole thing. For clarity, though, I'll give it to you anyway. After the show opens with a musical number performed by the UCLA men's choir (dressed in military attire, for reasons unknown), we find Pee-wee preparing the Playhouse for Christmas. His list to Santa is the length of a novel, and every visitor gives him a fruitcake, his least favorite thing in the world. Throughout, the audience gets a peek at different holiday traditions and learns the real meaning of Christmas. Ultimately, Pee-wee has to reconcile with his oversize greed and decides that helping others is the best gift he could give. All the Pee-wee's Playhouse regulars are here, including Cowboy Curtis (Laurence Fishburne), Miss Yvonne, the King of Cartoons, Reba the Mail Lady, Jambi, Chairry, Conky, Floory and the rest. But it's the roster of guest stars who come through that really makes this holiday special pop. And I'm not just talking about Santa Claus. Cher visited Pee-wee to reveal the day's secret word in Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse, streaming on Peacock. Just take a look at this wonderfully bizarre list of celebs that stop by: There's Little Richard, Whoopi Goldberg and Joan Rivers. You've got Magic Johnson, Charo and k.d. lang. It's a Beach Blanket Bingo reunion with the appearance of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, who are forced to craft holiday cards for the entirety of the special.

Shore performs the Twelve Days of Christmas over a pre-Zoom video call; lang sings a bopping rendition of Jingle Bell Rock. Both performances are fun in their own unique way.

The entire special exudes an air of gentle silliness, inviting you to sit back and enjoy a cup of cocoa — while maybe blowing bubbles in it with a straw.

309,3 Changes That Would Make Samsung's Galaxy Ring So Much Better,"Samsung's Galaxy Ringalready has a lot going for it. The ring's convenient portable battery case means you don't have to think too hard about when to charge it. The design is comfortable to wear throughout the day and night, and Samsung's Energy Score feels like a step towards what could one day be adigital health coach. But there are ways Samsung could push things forward, either in a next-generation model or via software updates. A silent alarm, easier access to workout metrics and more gesture controls could make the Galaxy Ring better at its most important jobs: being a sleep and exercise companion. The smart ring market is growing increasingly competitive. Oura just launched theOura Ring 4in October, and the Consumer Electronics Show is just around the corner, where we're bound to see even more health-tracking rings debut.The International Data Corporationpredicted in September that the smart ring category could grow by 88.4% in 2024, which would be a massive leap compared to other types of wearables such assmartwatches.That makes Samsung's approach to the smart ring space all the more important in the years to come. Read more:Smart Glasses Are Going to Work This Time, Google's Android President Tells CNET The Galaxy Ring can already tell me how well (or how poorly) I slept last night. But, I want it to let me know when it's time to wake up. A silent, vibrating alarm would make the Galaxy Ring infinitely more useful in that regard. Ideally, I'd want two options: One that wakes me up at the optimal time in my sleep cycle and a manual option to set an alarm at a specific time. Health tech company Circular's smart ringdoes exactly that, and I'm hoping Samsung follows suit as it'd make the Galaxy Ring feel like a more complete package. Adding vibration capabilities would likely make the Galaxy Ring thicker and heavier than the current model. But if Samsung ever launches different tiers of its smart ring in various price ranges, much like it does with its phones, perhaps a pricier ""pro"" or ""plus"" version of the ring could have an alarm, while a sleeker cheaper version would be sold without it. Smart rings, of course,don't have screens like smartwatchesand fitness bands do. That means you need to check your phone after a workout to see metrics like heart rate and burned calories. But a smartphone maker like Samsung can do a better job of working around this by taking advantage of how its wearables work in conjunction with phones. For example, what if you could pin health metrics to the always-on display on Samsung's phone? That would make it easier to see progress during a workout at a glance. Using the double pinch gesture to dismiss an alarm. One of the Galaxy Ring's most distinct capabilities is its gestures; you can take a picture or dismiss an alarm on yourSamsung phoneby double pinching your fingers. It might sound a little gimmicky -- and it is -- but I've found it surprisingly useful for silencing my alarm after groggily waking up from a nap. I'd love to see Samsung take this further. Media playback seems like another opportunity where gestures could be useful. I also like the idea of being able to customize what this gesture can do, such as answering or dismissing a phone call while wearing earbuds or starting and stopping a workout. Or what if Samsung added another gesture, like a single or triple pinch, so that you could choose more than one shortcut? It's unclear when or if Samsung will release new Galaxy Ring models every year as it does with phones and smartwatches. If it does, we likely won't hear more about it until the summer, which is when the company typically releases new wearable devices andfoldable phones. But what is clear is that there's plenty of room for Samsung's tiny health tracker to evolve.",Commentary: The Galaxy Ring is a good start. But Samsung could add more features and gestures to truly make its smart ring stand out.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/3-changes-that-would-make-samsungs-galaxy-ring-so-much-better/,
310,Apple Intelligence Brings Summaries to Mail and Other Apps in iOS 18,"Apple releasediOS 18.2on Dec. 11, more than a month after the tech giant releasediOS 18.1. The latest update brings a handful of new Apple Intelligence features to people with theiPhone 15 Pro and Pro Maxor a device from theiPhone 16 lineup, likeGenmojiandImage Playground. iOS 18.1 gave those iPhone owners access to Apple Intelligence, which can provide summaries in multiple places across their devices. Read more:Your iOS 18 Cheat Sheet WithApple Intelligenceand a compatible iPhone, your device can provide you with a summary of a lengthy email, a webpage, Message notifications and more. It can also show you a summary of what you have written in Notes and other messages. Here's what you need to know about summaries with Apple Intelligence on your iPhone. Note that before you use Apple Intelligence, you have to request it for your iPhone. To do so, go toSettings > Apple Intelligence & Siriand tapGet Apple Intelligence. Parsing through emails and email chains for information can be tedious, especially if you get a lot of work emails sent to your device. Thankfully, Apple Intelligence can summarize emails for you so you aren't reading a lot of preamble and want to just get right to the heart of the message. It was a great show if you were wondering. To view email summaries, open Mail, choose the email you want to read, and then pull your screen down to reveal a newSummarizebutton. Tap this and you'll see some lines of summary. You can change how many lines of summary you see by going toSettings > Apps > Mail > Previewand choosing anything from no lines of summary to five. It's also important to note that if you're usingiOS 18.2's Mail Categories, you can only see AI summaries for emails in your Primary category. Emails in other categories won't give you summaries. If you're using List View in Mail all your emails will have a summary available. Read more:What You Need to Know About Mail Categories in iOS 18.2 With Apple Intelligence, some of your apps can give you summaries of notifications on your Lock Screen, and this feature is on by default in most cases. This feature can summarize your notifications in a few words, but be careful while reading these. According to theBBC, one of the publication's headlines was summarized inaccurately. If you don't want to risk reading a bad summary, you can turn this feature off. Go toSettings > Notifications > Summarize Notificationsand tap the toggles next to the apps you no longer want to receive notification summaries from. You can also tap the toggle next toSummarize Notificationsat the top of the menu to turn the feature off for all apps. Read more:Apple's Notification Summaries Can Be Absurdly Wrong Apple Intelligence can also summarize certain webpages in Safari. To view these summaries, open Safari and go to a webpage, then look on the left side of the address bar. You should see a rectangle with a few dashes beneath it and sparkles. Tap this symbol and it pulls up a menu showing the summary of the webpage. Be aware that this feature isn't available on all webpages. On webpages this feature isn't working yet, the symbol on the left side of the address bar won't have any sparkles. Writing Toolsis an Apple Intelligence menu that lets you proofread, edit or alter something you're writing. It also lets you summarize your message or notes. To view these summaries, highlight what you want to summarize, tapWriting Toolsin the pop-up menu -- you might have to scroll through the options in this menu -- and then tapSummary. Writing Tools will show you a summary of what you have highlighted, and it will let youCopy,ReplaceandSharethat summary.

311,Don't Care About AI? 73% of Apple Users Agree With You. Here's How to Turn Off Apple Intelligence,"Apple and Google are hyping the AI features they're bringing to iPhone and Android smartphones -- Apple even cheekily hijacked the acronym by calling themApple Intelligence. But clearly not everyone is eager to jump into these new assisted technologies: a newsurvey by SellCellindicates that 73% of Apple users think AI adds little to no value to the phone experience, while CNET found that25% of smartphone owners are not interested at all. If Apple Intelligence holds no interest for you, or if you'd rather wait until the tech matures a bit more, it's easy to turn it off entirely or selectively disable some of the features. I'm not being anAI crank-- I appreciate features such as notification summaries and theClean Up toolin the Photos app. And yet, Apple Intelligence is also a work in progress, an evolving set of features that Apple is heavily hyping while gradually developing. I wouldn't hold it against you if you wanted to not be distracted or feel like you're doing Apple's testing for them (that's what thedeveloper and public betasare for). Remember that Apple Intelligence works only on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro or M-series Macs and iPads (plus the newest iPad mini). And if you've alreadyupdated to iOS 18.2, you need toadd yourself to the queuefor access to the new features. Here's what you need to know about disabling it. OpenSettings(iPhone or iPad) orSystem Settings(Mac) and chooseApple Intelligence & Siri. Then turn off theApple Intelligenceoption. Confirm your choice in the dialog that appears by tappingTurn Off Apple Intelligence. Turn off Apple Intelligence entirely with one switch. Here's what you lose: (Curiously, the Clean Up tool in Photos sticks around even when Apple Intelligence is turned off, perhaps because the first time you use it the app downloads resources for it.) Maybe you're finding some Apple Intelligence features helpful while others are annoying (or just highlyamusing). You can turn off specific features in the settings for apps to which they apply. For example, to disable text summaries in Messages notifications, go toSettings > Apps > Messagesand switch off theSummarize Messagesoption. Turn off Messages summaries while still using other Apple Intelligence features. Some features are not as app-specific. Writing Tools, which use Apple Intelligence to proof or rewrite text, appear as an option when you select text, regardless of the app. To turn that off, you need to disable Apple Intelligence system-wide. Also note that nearly every app includes an Apple Intelligence & Siri option in Settings, with aLearn from this Appoption (turned on by default). That applies just to whether Apple Intelligence and Siri can monitor how you use it to make suggestions; it doesn't affect any particular Apple Intelligence features.

312,Genmoji on Your iPhone Lets You Create the Right Emoji for Any Situation: Here's How,"How many times have you scrolled through the grid of emoji on your phone and asked aloud, ""How can there be no emoji for this""? I appreciate that I can digitally tell my family that brunch is ready by sending a waffle emoji, but not when I've made French toast. Although dozens of official emoji get added to every operating system — with new ones added every year — the process of creating and approving them is quite involved. Now, if you own aniPhone(or iPad) with access toApple Intelligence, you can create your own Genmoji (short for ""generated emoji""). In fact, a Genmoji can be an image of almost anything, including versions of yourself. But that presents a problem endemic to generated artwork in general: With a nearly limitless palette,where do you start? And which Genmoji work better as small in-line images? There's a reason theUnicode Standardis picky about which designs get approved. See also:Does that emoji mean what you think it means? I've been making (and annoying my friends with) lots of Genmoji examples and have come up with some suggestions for making Genmoji that stand out and convey what you're trying to express. Before we begin, make sure you own a device that can run Apple Intelligence: aniPhone 15 Pro,iPhone 16,iPhone 16 Pro, any iPad with an M-series processor or the latest iPad Mini. Although Apple Intelligence will run on any Mac with an M-series chip, the Genmoji feature isn't yet available as ofMacOS 15.2 Sequoia. For more on iOS 18.2, be sure to check outthe settings you need to change right nowandhidden features you might not know about. Since the Genmoji feature is tied to writing and composing, you access it from any app with text input, such as Messages, which is what I'll use for these examples. Here's how: Tap the message field to bring up the onscreen keyboard. Tap theEmojibutton to view the scrolling grid of symbols. To the right of theDescribe an Emojisearch field is a colorfulGenmojibutton — tap that. In theDescribe a Genmojifield that appears, type what you'd like to see. Access the Genmoji creator from the emoji panel. When you pause typing, the New Genmoji screen begins generating what you're describing. If you don't like what comes up, swipe left to view more options. TapAddonce you find a Genmoji you want to use. That adds it to the text field and also makes it available in the Recents category of emoji in the picker. (Are you not seeing the Genmoji button? Go toSettings > General > Keyboardand make sure theStickersoption is enabled.) Although emoji were initially designed to convey emotions (hence the ""emo"" part of the work), when making Genmoji you're relying on how a generative model interprets your description. A term such as ""frustrated"" gives me variations of standard emojis that don't immediately make one think of frustration. Using a more specific prompt gives you better results. Instead, think of something concrete that gets the feeling across, like ""angry possum with raised paws"" (which surprisingly elicited just one image when I tried it). I know, it's hard to believe that one wasn't in the Unicode registry. When you're coming up with text descriptions, the more detailed, the better (but also keep the next point in mind). Image generators thrive on specifics, so you'll get better results when you give Genmoji more help. Asking for a ""Christmas dog"" will give you several cute images, but writing ""Brown and gray dachshund wearing a Christmas sweater and a Santa hat viewed from the side"" is more likely to give you exactly what you want. The more details the better when creating Genmoji. Genmoji and emoji are designed to appear inline with other text, so complex designs may not read well. For instance, when viewed at typical text sizes, the hug emoji looks more like a silhouette of a movie projector than two people hugging. So although I just recommended you include lots of details, make sure they don't interfere with readability when the resulting Genmoji is viewed at the normally small size. A simpler design will be more readable at small emoji size. One advantage you have with Genmoji that the Unicode Standard can't match is — you. A Genmoji can be based on a photo of you (or someone else). Instead of making a Genmoji of a generic astronaut, put yourself in the suit. Type a name into the description field, or even something generic like ""man"" or ""woman."" It may prompt you to choose a person, or, if the text gains a dotted underline, tap that. Choose someone from the photos that appear and then tapDone. Base new Genmoji on a picture of yourself or someone else. To pick a different representative photo, tap theEditbutton that appears when the person is selected and choose a different rendering. Pick a different base image for the person. The great advantage of the Genmoji feature is that it'll attempt to create whatever you suggest. Earlier I cautioned about using a term like ""frustrated,"" but adding ""dinosaur"" created an amusing blue tyrannosaur-ish dino waving hands. Some days this really describes me. Also, don't forget that once your Genmoji is created, you can animate it using the newtext formatting options in iOS 18.","Apple Intelligence can create almost any emoji.

315,Your Wireless Earbuds and AirPods Are Gross. Here's How to Clean Them,"My new Beats Studio Pro headphones are never more than 10 feet away from me. I'm not exaggerating. I literally take them everywhere with me -- and that means they go through a lot each day. I listen to music at the gym and during my morning walk. I stream podcasts when I walk my dog four times a day. I dive into an audiobook when I'm shopping at the grocery store, walking in the airport or doing chores. Because I get so much mileage out of my earbuds, I have to clean them regularly. AirPodsor otherwireless earbuds-- from Beats to Bose to JBL and more -- collect dirt, debris, earwax and bacteria every time you pop them in your ears. Over time, this buildup can impair the audio quality of your headphones, but on a more serious note, it can also transfer bacteria into your ear canal and cause anasty infection. Simply cleaning your AirPods and other wireless headphones can prevent this. You'll want to make sure you're doing it the right way, though, so as not to damage your several-hundred-dollar headphones. Here's how. Read more:Applereleased the AirPods 4 earlier this year andhere's what we think about them. You can also find thebest AirPods deals here. Apple has suggested a few methodsfor cleaning your AirPods. This easiest is simply using a disinfecting or alcohol wipe to clean the exterior surface. Just make sure to not use the wipe on the mesh speaker part and to dry the buds completely with a clean cloth before popping them back into your ears. Since alcohol dries quickly, you shouldn't need to wait more than 60 seconds or so. For the microphone and speaker meshes, we recommend you use a dry cotton swab and a soft-bristled brush to gently wipe away dirt. Don't press too hard, though, since you could push the wax through the mesh and it would be nearly impossible to remove it then. CNET Insider bonus: CNET senior editorMatt Elliottalso suggests usingFun-Takto remove any stubborn earwax that's leftover after your initial wipe down. He instructs that you rub the Fun-Tak together to warm it up and then press it against the speaker. Then, you can use a wooden toothpick to scrape off anything stuck to the sides of the speaker hollow. Cleaning wireless earbuds with detachable silicone tips, like the AirPods Pro or JBL Reflect Flow Pro, is simpler due to the protective nature of the tips. The silicone shields the speaker from dirt, earwax and debris, so it never gets too grimy. The tips can be removed for easy cleaning. Just detach the silicone tips from the earphones and soak them in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes. For stubborn stains, you can agitate the container to loosen up the gunk. Once clean, use a soft cloth or cotton swab to wipe away any remaining earwax or dirt and set aside the silicone tips to air dry completely. If your earbuds don't come with silicone tips, you can purchase them separately from sources like Amazon. We recommend these affordable $13ear tipsthat can be attached to standard AirPods. Your AirPods, silicone tips and charging case all need to be cleaned. I can't go one day without seeing those trendy over-the-ear wireless headphones, like theApple AirPods MaxorBeats Studio Pro. And I'm not mad about it -- they're super stylish -- and I even sport my own pair day-in and day-out. But they take a bit more time to clean. Like other headphones, you should never run them under water, use abrasive tools or get liquids in any openings. The best method is to wipe down the headband portion with a disinfectant wipe and to pop the removed cushions into a container with a mixture of one teaspoon liquid laundry detergent and one cup of tepid water. After soaking, wipe the ear cushions and headband thoroughly with a clean cloth to dry. Then, lay the headphones flat to dry for at least a day before you reattach the cushions and use them again. Over-the-ear headphones with a headband need a regular wipe down, too. Yes, your charging case gets grimy too. And it doesn't make much sense to go through the effort of cleaning your earbuds only to return them to a dirty charging case. To clean the case, use a dry, lint-free cloth to wipe away any visible dirt. You can slightly dampen the cloth with water or rubbing alcohol, but be careful to avoid getting any liquid inside the charging ports.

These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features but also keep your phone secure. FromSamsung's Galaxy S24toGoogle's Pixel 9and9 Pro XL, you can choose from many fantastic Android phones. With all these options, it can be overwhelming or downright confusing to buy a new phone. We're here to help you find the best Android phone. A great Android phone should have high-quality cameras, long battery life, compelling software features and 5G support. Whether it's phones like theOnePlus 12andGoogle's affordable Pixel 8Aorfoldable phoneslike theMotorola Razr Plus (2024)andGalaxy Z Flip 6, CNET editors have tested and reviewed every phone on this handpicked list. Below are our picks for the best Android phones you can buy. If you're shopping for a Galaxy phone, know that Samsung is rumored to launch the Galaxy S25 series in January. Read more:Best VPN for Android for 2024 The $800 Samsung Galaxy S24's battery life is amazing. That's not the only reason it's our pick for best Android phone. It gets seven years of major Android updates and the cameras are good (there's even a 3x telephoto lens for zooming). Then there are all the AI features: most are just OK, but Circle to Search is outstanding. Samsung didn't reinvent the phone, but it did take a great phone (the Galaxy S23) and make it better. There are plenty of other excellent choices, although the Pixel 8 is our current favorite. What impresses me the most about theSamsung Galaxy S24isn't the newGalaxy AIfeatures, brighter screens or solid cameras. It's the battery life. After testing, I can say the larger battery in the Galaxy S24 has no trouble plowing through a long day of use on a single charge. The S24 is a wonderful, well-built phone that is excellent right out of the box just as the nearly identical S22 and S23 were before it. This similarity to the S22 and S23 can be viewed as either a strength because the design reflects three years of refinements, or a weakness because features like the camera hardware are essentially identical to what came out in 2022. All of these features are overshadowed by the battery life. you'll never hear anyone complain about getting too much battery life. Read ourSamsung Galaxy S24 review. There’s a lot to like about thePixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. Google’s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops. The Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren’t must-haves, and they’re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. When I consider theMotorola Razr Pluson its own terms, it is outstanding. Perhaps more importantly, it's a delight to use. The 4-inch cover screen makes the Razr feel like two phones in one. You can use pretty much any app on the outer display as well as respond to messages, watch videos, make video calls and even play games, all without opening the Razr Plus up. Add to that a long battery life, fast charging, improved cameras and an IPX8 rating that certifies that the Razr Plus will survive temporary dunking and you realize just how much value Motorola has poured into its flagship foldable. Its $1,000 price is steep, but you're getting one of the best clamshell-style foldables you can buy. The Pixel 8A is so good it makes the regular Pixel 8 almost feel irrelevant. It shares so much in common with its pricier sibling, from its selection of AI-powered features like Circle to Search to its cool aesthetic and powerful Tensor G3 processor, that it’s hard to see why anyone would buy the Pixel 8 instead. The Pixel 8 does offer a marginally better camera system, a slightly larger screen and the ability to charge other phones and accessories wirelessly on the back of the device. Those features don’t feel significant enough to impact the buying decision for most people. As I wrote inmy review, the Pixel 8A raises the bar for what a $500 phone should be. That also means I’ll be expecting more from the Pixel 9 this fall. TheMotorola Moto G Power 5Gis the most versatile option in this roundup, offering wireless charging, a 120Hz high refresh rate screen, Google Pay for contactless payments and a fantastic vegan leather design. Combine that with a camera that takes decent photos in bright environments, and a processor that is capable of most daily tasks, and you have a phone that’s both fun to use without cramming itself with the extra bells and whistles we see in higher-priced phones. Although this phone does suffer from having a shorter software and security support timeline (1 year of major Android OS, three years of security updates) than Samsung’s Galaxy A25 5G, it is a more useful device. It's this appeal that makes the Moto G Power 5G our top recommendation for a phone that costs $300 or less. With a sharper 5x optical zoom, a faster new processor and that familiar giant display and 100x digital zoom, the Samsung’s “Ultra” phone remains a top choice for mobile photographers who want plenty of screen space. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is also one of the first phones with Samsung’s new Galaxy AI features, which include tools for translating text messages and phone calls instantly and Circle to Search, a new gesture that lets you launch a Google search for almost anything simply by drawing a circle around it. Like the previous two generations, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with an embedded S Pen for those who like jotting down notes or doodling. Perhaps best of all, Samsung has committed to updating these devices with new versions of Android for seven years, meaning it shouldn’t feel out of date anytime soon. Still, there are some important downsides to consider. At $1,300, this phone isexpensive, so be sure to look for trade-in discounts if you plan to upgrade. For that high price, I had hoped Samsung would’ve added extra Galaxy AI features that are specific to the Ultra -- perhaps some that take advantage of the S Pen. Galaxy AI is the same on all Galaxy S24 devices, and it’ll be coming to the Galaxy S23 lineup soon too, so you don’t have to splurge on Samsung’s top-of-the-line phone if you just care about those features. Read ourSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra review. If fast charging, powerful performance and having a large, bright screen matter most to you in a phone, check out the OnePlus 12. OnePlus’ new phone can go from empty to full in less than 30 minutes thanks to its 80-watt charging in the US, a perk that can be helpful if you have a long day ahead and forgot your charger. It runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, which feels swift and zippy whether you’re playing games or just scrolling around the interface. The OnePlus 12’s 4,500-nit peak brightness also makes it ideal for outdoor use, since its screen is noticeably brighter than rivals like the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. There’s room for improvement when it comes to the camera. Shots taken on the Plus 12 are decent, but CNET’s Andrew Lanxon found nighttime photos look too dark and described the optical zoom as “very hit or miss.” It’s also worth noting that the OnePlus 12 gets four years of software updates. That would have been fine by 2023’s standards, but Google and Samsung now offer seven years of Android updates, which keeps those devices fresh and relevant for a longer period. Read ourOnePlus 12 review. ThePixel 9 Proand9 Pro XLhave a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. It's the AI skills that really stand out; from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts. The phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low light and night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (although you get the first year for free). If you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. For better or worse,Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6foldable is packed with AI. It can take a rough sketch and turn it into artwork or help me have a conversation in French or Korean despite me only knowing a few words of either language. The new autofocus/auto zoom feature lets you prop the phone in a half-open position, the Z Flip 6 will automatically zoom in or out (switching between the main and ultrawide cameras) to get a photo that best suits the moment. Samsung's latest clamshell-style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, a smaller hinge and crease, a larger battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. All this comes at a higher starting price: $1,099 which makes it hard to appreciate the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for the absolutely great phone that it is. Editor's note: Google released the Pixel 8A, also $500. You canread our Pixel 8A review here. If you're buying a Pixel 7A make sure it's on sale. Google's budget phone leaped forward in 2023 with the Pixel 7A, which offers many of the same benefits as thePixel 7but at a cheaper price. Like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, meaning it has many of the same photo editing and language translation features as its pricier sibling. The Pixel 7A's 64-megapixel camera also takes excellent photos that rival the Pixel 7's in quality. We still like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A's lower price makes it a better deal for most people. Only opt for the Pixel 7 if you really want a slightly larger screen and are willing to pay the extra $100 for it. Otherwise, themain differencesbetween the Pixel 7 and 7A come down to the former's more durable build, slightly faster charging and its ability to wirelessly charge compatible accessories. The Pixel 7 also has a larger camera sensor that's more sensitive to light, according to Google, but CNET's Lisa Eadicicco didn't notice much of a difference.Read our Google Pixel 7A review. With theGalaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung is getting closer to its goal of making a device that doubles as a phone and a tablet without compromising too much in either direction. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has an improved design with a sleeker look that’s easier to grip, a less noticeable crease, a new processor and an upgraded ultrawide camera.  It’s really the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s big, bright and crisp internal screen that makes it the best choice for those who want a foldable phone for entertainment. Be prepared to spend a pretty penny: The Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at an eye-watering $1,900, making it $100 more expensive than last year’s Z Fold 5 was at launch. The Nothing Phone 2 stands out for its unconventional design that incorporates flashing LED lights, a relatively low price and fast performance. Unlike the Nothing Phone 1, you can buy the Nothing Phone 2 in the US, for $699. It's best suited for those who want a phone with a large, bright screen, powerful processor and a design that makes a statement, all for well below $1,000. It's important to remember that Nothing has a lot of competition in this price range. If camera quality is your top priority, you can get the Pixel 8A at a lower price of $449.Read our Nothing Phone 2 review. We test every aspect of a new phone from the battery and processor to the cameras. We test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus. Photography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes such as the 4K 120fps slow motion mode that debuted on the iPhone 16 Pro or the Add ME photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series. Battery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 largely has the same camera hardware as the Z Flip 4. But the new chip brings some image processing improvements. We use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. We perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Readmore:How We Test Phones Look at last year's phones:Companies typically keep previous models around at a discounted price. For example, while you can buy the$699 Pixel 8or$999 Pixel 8 Pro. Get more for less with cheap phones:For a fraction of the cost, you can get a solid phone that does almost everything a pricier flagship phone can do. The Google Pixel 7A packs a good camera and is frequently discounted to under $400. Check your Android type:Some phones, like Google's Pixel series, run a stock version of Android. Others, like Samsung's Galaxy phones, have their own software (OneUI) on top of Android. Each type has its own appeal and drawbacks. If you've been rocking a Samsung phone for years, you'll likely still be more at home on a new Galaxy phone. Be ready for Cyber Monday sales:The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones. Test your phone:It's definitely worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it. Find peace of mind with a case:You spent all this time choosing a phone, now protect it from damage with a case. The$450 Samsung Galaxy A54 5Gproves you can get a phone with solid performance for a very reasonable price. It packs a 6.4-inch display, an octa-core processor that offers enough power for daily essentials (including light gaming) and a camera that does a decent job of handling your out-and-about snaps. Its 128GB of storage will be enough for most people, and those who need more space can expand it with microSD cards up to 1TB in size. The$1,400 Sony Xperia 1 Vretains all the best features of previous Xperia 1 phones, like a 4K high refresh rate display, expandable storage, cutting-edge cameras with eye-tracking autofocus, a 5,000-mAh battery, a dedicated hardware shutter button and a headphone jack, all wrapped in Sony's lovely, mundane utilitarian design. The phone brims with numerous quality-of-life improvements for its target audience of creative types like photographers, filmmakers, musicians and gamers who want nuanced control over the content they make. Its $1,400 price tag keeps this phone squarely aimed beyond most consumers. TheAsus ROG Phone 8 Prois a $1,200 gaming phone that takes nearly every feature to the extreme. It has a 5,500-mAh battery, a 6.78-inch AMOLED with a high refresh rate and touch sampling rate, 65W wired charging and even a door on the back for a detachable fan to keep the phone's Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip as cool as possible. The software is optimized and easily customized for gaming including touch-sensitive areas on the sides of the phone that double as shoulder buttons for games. Android phones come in all shapes and sizes. Prices range from just a couple hundred dollars for a basic smartphone to $1,800 for state-of-the-art foldable phones. All the phones on this list are durable, have an IP rating for water and dust resistance and years of software support. Every phone on this list varies in how many years of software support you get and how long you can extend the warranty, but most should last you a few years if not more.","From Google's Pixel 9 and Samsung's Galaxy S24 to foldable phones like Motorola's Razr Plus, these are the best Android phones you can buy.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-android-phone/,

320,Xiaomi 15 Ultra Rumors: It Could be 2025's Best Camera Phone,"TheXiaomi 14 Ultrawas one of the most exciting phone launches of 2024 thanks to its stellar camera setup that allowed it to take amazing images. It packed a 1-inch type image sensor, which is physically larger than almost any other smartphone camera sensor, and it made all the difference. That bigger size, together with the wide, variable aperture, let it capture more light to produce some of thebest results I've ever seen from a camera phone. It also packed a top-end processor for lightning-fast performance, a vibrant display and a battery that lasted the better part of a day. All in all, it was a superb flagship Android phone for those of you wanting to focus on your image-taking. But the tech world doesn't hang around for long and already there are rumors circulating around what we might see from its successor, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Here then is what we know about this potential photography powerhouse. We'll be updating this article over the coming weeks and months as more rumors surface, so make sure to check back regularly to find out more about the phone. The 14 Ultra was announced in China in February and was first shown off to Western press -- including CNET -- atMobile World Congress 2024in Barcelona back in February. It wasn't until later in March that I was able to get my hands on it for testing. While Xiaomi has yet to confirm the launch date for the phone, all signs suggest that the company is planning a similar timeframe for the follow-up. It's already taken the wraps off the base Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro for the Chinese market -- again, following the same schedule as the 14 and 14 Pro last year. The 14 Ultra went on sale in the UK for £1,299 and while it's not officially on sale in the US, that price equates to $1,640. There's been no word on any significant changes in the company's pricing so we'd expect the 15 Ultra to sit in that ballpark. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra's cameras. Xiaomi's Ultra line has always focused on photography, with the 14 Ultra packing not just a massive image sensor, but a variable aperture and an impressive 5x optical zoom. We firmly expect the 15 Ultra to be similarly aimed towards photographers and indeed early leaks support that. Known tipsterIce Universe reportedthat the 15 Ultra's periscope telephoto camera will feature a whopping 200-megapixel image sensor. That's a huge step up from the 50-megapixel sensor found on the 14 Ultra. The downside? Ice Universe also says the optical zoom will drop from 5x to 4.4x, although the extra resolution will presumably allow for further digital zoom without a noticeable loss in quality. Alleged leaked renders of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. This change to the telephoto camera unit is apparently backed up by leaked renders of the phonefrom SmartPrix, which show an off-center camera unit at the top. A further leaked image (via GSM Arena) purportedly showing the internals of the camera setup indicates that it's off center in order to make room for its large periscope unit. The renders, if accurate, also confirm the continued relationship between Xiaomi and Leica, so expect high-quality lens optics and various Leica color presets to spice up your images. So far there are few other rumors around the rest of the cameras, including any changes to the main camera and its 1-inch type sensor. I'd certainly hope that Xiaomi continues using at least this sensor size -- if not going even larger -- and maintaining its variable aperture, which can go from wide open at f/1.6 to more closed down at f/4, resulting in attractive starbursts around points of light at night. Given that the 14 Ultra packed the latest QualcommSnapdragon 8 Gen 3processor when it launched, it's safe to assume that Xiaomi will equip its new model with Qualcomm's next-generation silicon. Qualcomm took the wraps off theSnapdragon 8 Elite in October, and we expect to start seeing it in most flagship phones launching within the next six months. Apart from an expected overall increase in speed, the 8 Elite processor promises improved web browsing speed and is particularly geared towards AI tasks, including powering on-device AI tools like Samsung's Galaxy AI. At its launch event, Qualcomm showed off an AI-powered tool that adds artificial lighting to your selfies, whichCNET's David Lumb called""delightfully fun and helpful"" when he tried it for himself. We expect to see a variety of AI tools on board Xiaomi's 15 Ultra, for both image manipulation and virtual assistance. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra was a powerhouse. The 15 Ultra is expected to be the same, with the latest Qualcomm chips on board. Rumors tentatively suggest that the 15 Ultra's display will remain at 6.7 inches, like the 14 Ultra, although the battery may be expanded to 6,000 mAh, up from 5,000 mAh. Whether this remains the case on models outside of China remains to be seen as the 14 Ultra did have a slightly larger battery size for models sold within China. It's expected that the phone will continue to offer 90W wired charging, although I'd like to see the company take this further. Some of Xiaomi's other phones -- including the 11T Pro, released back in 2021 -- offer 120W fast charging and it's disappointing not to see such speeds on the company's flashiest, most expensive model.",The Xiaomi 14 Ultra packed a superb camera setup. Its follow up could be one of the best camera phones of next year.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/xiaomi-15-ultra-rumors-it-could-be-2025-best-camera-phone/,

326,"The Hidden Ones, an Upcoming Fighting Game, Blends Chinese Kung Fu and the Supernatural","Despite the numerous fighting games from huge series like Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8, there aren't a lot out these days replicating actual martial arts. That's where The Hidden Ones comes in, an upcoming game from Tencent studio Morefun, which blends motion-captured kung fu with supernatural powers to make a compelling 3D fighter with a surprising amount of depth. Morefun is planning to release The Hidden Ones in the third quarter of 2025, with prealpha in January and a closed beta in March. I got to preview a few hours of the game in Los Angeles. It has the ebb-and-flow 3D fighting feel ofDragon Ball: Sparking Zerocombined with a broad catalog of fighters. So far, it's a fun fighting game that's easy to pick up and use special skills, but with a deeper complexity I still haven't gotten the hang of. While 2D fighters have ruled the roost with room for technical precision, The Hidden Ones blends free 3D movement with timing and counters to produce a promising and fun fighting system. The Hidden Ones is an adaptation ofHitori no Shita: The Outcast, a popular webcomic in China turned into a five-season animated series and more recently a live-action TV show. The story follows the emergence of the Eight Secret Arts, which were recently rediscovered as powerful martial arts mastered by fighters who, naturally, fight each other a ton. Blending Chinese kung fu, Taoism, spirits, yin-yang bagua and chi energy, the franchise blends martial arts and supernatural myth. Developers play a demonstration match using mouse-and-keyboard controls. ""The whole perspective of Outcast is very interesting and very unique [with] the Chinese myths and martial arts flavor,"" lead game designer Fox Lin said through an interpreter. Outcast tells a very human story in Chinese context, replete with Taoism -- a philosophical and religious tradition with practices of self-cultivation to embrace humanistic virtues of compassion and monastic simplicity. Martial arts like tai chi and the various traditions under the umbrellas of kung fu and wushu are based in Taoist philosophy. While other fighting games like Street Fighter have flashy effects, Morefun wanted to ground The Hidden Ones' combat in martial arts. While fighters in Outcast have supernatural abilities, they're woven into more traditional combat. Morefun used motion capture on actual martial artists for every character's moves in-game, according to senior game designer Stan Fan: ""In the game, even someone with magic powers will [use it] in the martial arts way, to combine them together so that you will see how they move and the details of the martial art itself."" Read more:Best Anime Streaming Services of 2024 I could easily see this mix in The Hidden Ones. Each fighter has their own special abilities to weave into basic attacks or use to catch an opponent off guard. But the game is unique in another way: It was built from the ground up to be playable on PC and mobile -- no console plans have been announced -- so the fighting system is streamlined for simple commands with special abilities mapped to simple button presses. That puts extra emphasis on positioning and battle flow. Often I dashed in for a basic attack combo, only for my opponent to catch me with a special ability first. This is how The Hidden Ones stands out. In my duels with other players, we began by carefully circling, waiting for the other to commit to a move and try to punish with a combo of our own. Given the range of abilities among the character roster -- some have narrow ranged abilities, others have close-up area attacks, and so on -- it was a lot of fun to see how certain fighters stacked up against each other. Even when I got trounced, it was great to roll into the next fight with a better understanding of the combat. In Trials mode, your fighter faces off against goons and bosses. There were three modes available to us in the preview -- single-player story, one-versus-one duels and a boss rush trials mode -- but I only got to two as I was drawn into both. I played a midgame chapter of the single-player story following one of the fighters, Wang Ye, as he figures out who sent a gang of goons after his family. Naturally, he's gotta fight his way to the truth through urban back alleys and beautiful courtyards. The game roughly follows the original story of the webcomic and animated series, but certain things have been changed and added for the game -- like the grudge-bearing gang lieutenant I fought at the end of the chapter, whose second phase involved summoning a temple-sized snake spirit. With plenty of anime-styled cutscenes and several fighters appearing throughout, the story mode is shaping up to be a fun jaunt. It was entertaining enough to distract me from diving into the trials mode, where players can take on other bosses and selectively ramp up the difficulty -- which was a bummer, since I missed out on taking on a nasty boss with a fire spear that sped around the stage on fire wheels beneath her feet (based onNezha, the Third Lotus Prince in Taoism). But the meat of The Hidden Ones, like all fighting games, is in its versus mode. Nine fighters from Hidden Ones catalog of characters for its Duels PvP mode. In duels, I chose between three fighters from the nine available for us to play and threw myself into combat against other previewers and developers in the room. I quickly found fighters I favored, including a wild-haired old demon man in a suit with clawing slash attacks ending in an electric smash. But the real room favorite was Ru Hua, a slender hunched-over woman with a ghost-white face who whipped around chain-connected kunai daggers for vicious ranged blows -- I beat down and was beaten by her a few times. While Outcast fans will doubtless recognize these characters, I certainly didn't. It was refreshing to discover a new lineup of fighters with strong visual and combat identities who haven't already appeared in a famous franchise from Capcom, SNK or Namco. I was also delighted by the game's combat, which felt like a grounded version of Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero's 3D arena fighting at a slower pace. The developers at the preview presented a triad of combat flow, where basic attacks can be stopped by defending, defending can counter special combat skills and attacks can interrupt said skills -- unless, as I found, an enemy dives into a fight with a skill or shoots it from a distance away. More powerful ""sinister skills"" can only be evaded by dodging, which consumes one point of stamina, represented by five yellow diamonds shown on screen. If you're getting pummeled by a skill or basic attack combo, you can break away, using three stamina points -- but if you use up all your stamina, you'll blink red in a more vulnerable state that takes more damage. And ultimate skills, which charge up over time and knock out a chunk of health, can only be dodged -- which is possible if you see it coming, leaving the enemy open for a counterattack. There's more complicated strategy in the combat system, too: If someone defends for too long, a basic attack will turn into a grab. You can also counter in the middle of a basic attack combo if you time it right, which I couldn't nail down. On top of all this are support skills, which you equip before combat with a budget of up to four summon points for up to three skills. Simple summons like flinging spirit daggers cost one point, meatier ones take two and the most powerful take three, which can do things like lay down a healing aura on the ground. I barely grasped the depth of this system, but it opens up a lot of potential for customizing your combat flow beyond character abilities. At the end of the day, it's still a one-on-one fight where you bring your three chosen fighters against an opponent's trio. Knock down one and the round ends, with your character recovering a bit of health by an amount that is, intriguingly, not fixed but up to an internal algorithm. While I didn't get the specifics when talking to developers, I noticed I only got back maybe a quarter of my health bar when taking out an opponent's character. If you wait for the round's timer to expire, though, you won't get any health back at all. What most surprised me was how easy it was to catch on to the ebb and flow of The Hidden Ones' combat. I knew I'd overextended myself a millisecond before an opponent punished me with a counter, and I had only myself to blame. It didn't matter whether I was playing with a controller or mouse and keyboard during combat -- and I've never used the latter in a fighting game. That's testament to the game's combat design, where you're constantly locked on to the enemy and left to focus on when and how you close the distance to pummel or use a skill. That makes it easier to imagine how the game will play on mobile (we didn't get a preview of that functionality) -- and amazingly enough, Morefun expects to have crossplay between phone and PC players. While the developers aren't too worried about latency given local servers in the markets they're planning to reach (North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, China and other regions in Asia), the developers did acknowledge that PC players may have an easier time inputting precise commands compared to touch-based inputs on phones. ""The team ran a lot of exclusive tests within the players we recruit [of PC and mobile players] just to ensure the best experience for the majority of players,"" Lin said. ""We also provide personalized options for them to adjust to their own customizations. The team did a lot of research on that."" And there are other adjustments to the game based on what platform they're playing on. If you're on mobile, cutscenes will zoom in on characters to best fit a smartphone's smaller but wider-format screen, while playing on PC will zoom out for larger displays. Despite only playing for around 90 minutes, The Hidden Ones seems like a fun mix of polished martial arts action with some eye-catching supernatural powers, all wrapped around a tight fighting system that felt uniquely pleasing for both button mashers and more skilled players. We'll have to see if the story mode is compelling on its own for newcomers and Outcast fans, but fighting game veterans who enjoy the more freeform 3D arena subgenre will want to keep a lookout for the prealpha tests in January and closed beta in March to try Hidden Ones for themselves.","Based on a popular Chinese comic and TV show, this could give Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero a run for its money.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-hidden-ones-an-upcoming-fighting-game-blends-chinese-kung-fu-and-the-supernatural/,

There's the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus which sport new AI features in addition to packing outstanding performance, great cameras and long-lasting batteries. If you're looking for a versatile camera setup and a big screen there's the $1,300Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. If you want a cheaper option there's theGalaxy A15 5G, which carries a price tag of roughly $200. You could buy six of them for the price of one S24 Ultra. And then there are Samsung's foldable phones with screens the fold in half to be more portable. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 come with many improvements over previous models. The Z Flip has a new main camera but also comes with a higher starting price. With so many different phone models at a variety of prices, you might have a difficult time making choosing which phone to buy. But don't worry, we've tested and reviewed every phone on this list and are here to help you find the best Samsung phone. Be warned if you're buying a Galaxy S24 model that there are rumors that the Galaxy S25 lineup will be announced in January. Also see:Best VPN for Android for 2024 The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra -- priced at $1,300 -- comes packed with maximum features which, for most people, is more than necessary. For the rest of us, the $800 Galaxy S24 is a standout among its Galaxy counterparts. It has the same Snapdragon customized chip as the S24 Ultra, runs the same version of Android and costs $500 less. The Galaxy S24 has a very capable triple rear camera setup that is versatile in capturing both bright outdoor scenes and candid moments inside under mixed lighting. Overall, the Galaxy S24 is ideal for Android fans who prioritize fast performance, solid cameras and a spacious, bright screen in a compact package. Deciding which Samsung phone is right for you comes down to what you want in a phone and how much you're willing to spend. If you want the largest screen available on a standard Samsung phone, enjoy note-taking with a stylus and need a camera with a significantly closer zoom, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is the right choice. You'll also have to spend more than $1,100 unless you score a trade-in deal. Those who don't need the stylus, prefer more compact devices and still want a top-notch camera should consider the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24 Plus. If you just want the basics, like a spacious screen, 5G and a decent camera, consider theGalaxy S23 FE. Those looking for the flashiest tech around -- and who also have deep pockets -- should consider the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6. It's also important to consider whether now is the right time to upgrade. If you have a relatively new phone that's two to three years old and still functions properly, you can probably wait. Samsung committed to supporting seven generations of Android operating system updates for devices like the Galaxy S24 series, which improves their longevity. Finding the best Samsung phone will ultimately come down to preference. Choosing among so many options can get complicated, so here's how to decide which Samsung phone is best for you. Check out ourphone buying guidefor more tips on how to choose the right device. With a sharper 5x optical zoom, a faster new processor and that familiar giant display and 100x digital zoom, the Samsung’s “Ultra” phone remains a top choice for mobile photographers that want plenty of screen space. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is also one of the first phones with Samsung’s new Galaxy AI features, which include tools for translating text messages and phone calls instantly and Circle to Search, a new gesture that lets you launch a Google search for almost anything simply by drawing a circle around it. Like the previous two generations, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with an embedded S Pen for those who like jotting down notes or doodling. But perhaps best of all, Samsung has committed to updating these devices with new versions of Android for seven years, meaning it shouldn’t feel out of date anytime soon. Still, there are still some important downsides to consider. At $1,300, this phone isexpensive, so be sure to look for trade-in discounts if you plan to upgrade. And for that high price, I had hoped Samsung would’ve added extra Galaxy AI features that are specific to the Ultra -- perhaps some that take advantage of the S Pen. But Galaxy AI is the same on all Galaxy S24 devices, and it’ll be coming to the Galaxy S23 lineup soon too, so you don’t have to splurge on Samsung’s top-of-the-line phone if you just care about those features. Read ourSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra review. For better or worse,Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6foldable is packed with AI. It can take a rough sketch and turn it into artwork or help me have a conversation in French or Korean despite my only knowing a few words of either language. The new autofocus/auto zoom feature lets you prop the phone in a half-open position, the Z Flip 6 will automatically zoom in or out (switching between the main and ultrawide cameras) to get a photo that best suits the moment. Samsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, a smaller hinge and crease, a larger battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. But all this comes at a higher starting price: $1,099, which makes it hard to appreciate the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for the absolute great phone that it is. What impresses me the most about theSamsung Galaxy S24isn't the newGalaxy AIfeatures, brighter screens or solid cameras. It's the battery life. After testing, I can say the larger battery in the Galaxy S24 has no trouble plowing through a long day of use on a single charge. The S24 is a wonderful, well-built phone that is excellent right out of the box, just as the nearly identical S22 and S23 were before it. This similarity to the S22 and S23 can be viewed as either a strength because the design reflects three years of refinements, or a weakness because features like the camera hardware are essentially identical to what came out in 2022. But all of this is overshadowed by the great battery life. You'll never hear anyone complain about getting too much battery life. Read ourSamsung Galaxy S24 review. Samsung’s $200 Galaxy A15 5G is an easy choice for someone looking to buy a phone that will last for years. Samsung provides it with four years of software updates and five years of security support, which in this price range is unparalleled. Plus the phone supports 25W wired charging that in my testing was able to charge half of its big 5,000-mAh battery from empty in 30 minutes. I also like the eye-catching light blue option. A $200 phone has to have some compromises. The Galaxy A15 5G feels sluggish compared to competing phones like Motorola’s $200 Moto G 5G, and as an entertainment machine falls short with its single audio speaker that is blocked by accident when you hold the phone sideways for games and video. Photography, which is typically a weak point on phones in this price range, is similarly mixed with decent photography in outdoor environments while struggling to photograph lowlight spaces. This makes the Galaxy A15 5G an easy choice for when you just need a phone that can handle the basics, but you may want to consider other options if you are looking for the best pocket YouTube player in this price range. After testing the 6.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus by playing games, texting and calling in multiple languages, taking photos, recording videos and trying out all that Galaxy AI has to offer, I'm happy to say it's outstanding. Samsung didn't reinvent the phone, but it did take a great phone and make it better. The challenge for the S24 Plus is thatGoogle's Pixel 8 Prohas the same price and slightly better cameras. I do think the S24 Plus is an overall better phone in nearly every other respect, even software, which has been rock solid in my testing. Read ourSamsung Galaxy S24 Plus review. With theGalaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung is getting closer to its goal of making a device that doubles as a phone and a tablet without compromising too much in either direction. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has an improved design with a sleeker look that’s easier to grip, a less noticeable crease, a new processor and an upgraded ultrawide camera. But it’s really the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s big, bright and crisp internal screen that makes it the best choice for those who want a foldable phone for entertainment. However, be prepared to spend a pretty penny: The Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at an eye-watering $1,900, making it $100 more expensive than last year’s Z Fold 5 was at launch. Get more for less with cheap phones:For a fraction of the cost, you can get a solid phone that does almost everything a pricier flagship phone can do. The Galaxy S23 FE packs a good camera and costs only $630 before discounts or trade-in offers. Be ready for Cyber Monday sales:The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones. Test your phone:It's worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it. Find peace of mind with a case:You spent all this time picking a phone, now protect it from damage with a case. We test the battery, screen, performance, cameras and more on every phone we review. We test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus. Photography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting levels. We try out any new camera modes such as ProRes Log video that debuted with the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max or the Magic Editor photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 8 series. Battery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update. We perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. We use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. Read more:How We Test Phones The right phone for you depends on a variety of factors, such as your budget, your current phone and whether you own other mobile accessories from the same company, such as earbuds or smartwatches. Many people prefer to stick with phones from the same company because the experience is more consistent and there's less of a learning curve when switching to a new device. The same holds true for Samsung; the company's One UI software (its customized version of Android) can be found across its phone lineup. Samsung's One UI 6 introduced a more customizable lock screen and the ability to answer a phone call through a text message instead of speaking. Consistency aside, there are some benefits to choosing a Samsung phone over devices from other Android phone makers. Samsung usually excels when it comes to display quality and brightness, and it typically offers a lot of choices in terms of size and pricing. Samsung phones usually offer decent battery life -- especially midsize and large phones -- and the cameras are usually among the best, especially on the Galaxy S24 lineup. Samsung also offers seven years of Android version updates for most of its new smartphones, which is longer support than even Google provides for its Pixel phones. Google's Pixel devicesalso have stellar cameras along with specific software features you can't get elsewhere. TheOnePlus 12is also cheaper than the Galaxy S24 Plus and Galaxy S24 Ultra at regular prices without a trade-in and offers faster charging speeds. It could be a better choice for those who want to pay a little less but still want a giant 6.82-inch screen and triple rear camera. Samsung's Galaxy A and S families serve different purposes, so which one is right for you will depend on your needs and budget. The Galaxy A lineup is Samsung's mid-tier and budget line, and it's the best choice if you're looking for aphone under $500without a trade-in deal. These phones typically offer core features like a big screen, large battery and multiple cameras at a cheaper price. You also get what you pay for; Samsung's cheapest phones have very limited storage space and poorer cameras compared with the pricier models, and they sometimes struggle with juggling multiple tasks. More expensive phones like the Galaxy A35 5G provide almost everything most people want in a basic phone, although you'll still have to compromise a bit on camera quality and general performance. The Galaxy S series, on the other hand, is Samsung's flagship smartphone line. Galaxy S phones usually include the best tech that Samsung has to offer and features you'd expect on any high-end phone, such as a premium design, 5G support, screens with high refresh rates and multiple high-end cameras. The biggest updates that launched with the Galaxy S24 lineup, for example, included the bump to a 200-megapixel main camera on the Ultra and bigger batteries for the smaller models. You'll have to be willing to pay hundreds of dollars more than you would for a Galaxy A series phone in most cases.",Samsung has a range of smartphones from affordable models like the Galaxy S25 to pricier ones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Galaxy Z Fold 6.

The video on the company's X post announcing the launch includes the term ""OnePlus 13 Series,"" so we can assume that the midrange OnePlus 13R model will also be released at the Jan. 7 event. Specs have not yet been officially announced but the North American version of the OnePlus 13 is largely expected to be the same as the Chinese model, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a powerful 6,000 mAh battery with fast charging and water resistance. The company confirmed, however, the OnePlus 13 will come in three colors: midnight ocean (blue), black eclipse (black) and arctic dawn (white). The midnight ocean model will be its first phone to feature microfiber vegan leather. Last year, CNET's Andrew Lanxon wasimpressed by the OnePlus 12's powerful processor, stellar battery life and big, vibrant display, but he was disappointed by its camera performance and its offering of fewer years of security updates compared to rivals. That model started at $800. The OnePlus 13R is believed to be a more affordable version of the flagship with somewhat scaled-down specs. The OnePlus Watch 3, its next-generation smartwatch with more health-related features, may also launch at the Jan. 7 event.

331,Supreme Court to Hear TikTok Case: What to Know,"The US Supreme Court will take up TikTok's challenge of a law that if allowed to go into effect could lead to aUS ban of the popular social media platform. The nation's highest court said on Tuesdaythat it will hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 10, just before the ban is set to kick in on Jan. 19. The news comes after the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit earlier this month denied both TikTok's request to overturn the law and a motion for the court to issuean emergency injunctionto put the law on hold pending Supreme Court consideration. The law would ban the app if it's not sold to a party deemed fit by US officials by the January deadline. In its Supreme Court filing, TikTok argued that allowing the law to go into effect would infringe on the rights of TikTok's millions of US users. TikTok said Wednesday that's is pleased with the court's decision to take up its case. ""We believe the court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,"" the company said in a statement. In its rulings earlier this month, the appeals courtrejected that same argument, acknowledging that while the ban would require TikTok's millions of users ""to find alternative media of communication,"" it's justified by the ""hybrid commercial threat"" China poses to US national security. ""The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,"" Senior Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the ruling. ""Here, the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States."" Read more:TikTok Backups: 6 Similar Apps for Your Daily Dose of Fun Lawmakers in both political parties have long voiced concerns that TikTok, which has more than 170 million American users, could be a threat to national security and could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or spread disinformation to further China's agenda. TikTok continues to deny those accusations. Ahead of votes in Congress earlier this year,TikTok rallied its US users, calling on them to urge their representatives on Capitol Hill to vote down a ban. But the measure ultimately passed by wide margins in both chambers of Congress and was signed by President Joe Biden. It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court could rule, but the company also could get help from the incoming Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who'd pushed for a ban during his first term, now says he's no longer in favor of one. Unless halted by the court, the ban could go into effect as soon as Jan. 19, the day before Trump is set to be inaugurated. So what's next for lawmakers and TikTok? Here's what you need to know. The law is aimed at forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok to a buyer American officials are OK with, as well as guaranteeing that ByteDance no longer has access to US user data or control over the TikTok algorithm that decides what videos American users see. TikTok was given nine months to comply, hence the Jan. 19 deadline, at which point the government could require the removal of its app from US app stores. The president could grant a 90-day extension. Biden, who signed the bill that established those requirements, remains in office until Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.

332,You Can Install Android 16 Developer Preview 2 Right Now. Here's What's New,"A month after Google announced the first developer preview for Android 16, devs can now download and install Android 16 developer preview 2 to test out apps. This latest build brings app experience enhancements, battery life improvements and performance boosts,according to Google's blog. Google is giving early testers a glimpse at next year's Android 16 with a limited preview of the upcoming operating system update. It's all part of the company's plan to get Android updates out faster to users. In November, Google announced the first Android 16 developer preview three months ahead of schedule compared with last year'sfirst preview of Android 15. Starting this early means the final version of Android 16 is expected to be released in the second quarter of 2025, a window that would be ahead of the operating system's typical full release in the third quarter. (Android 15launched in late October.) ""We're planning the major release a quarter earlier (Q2 rather than Q3 in prior years) to better align with the schedule of device launches across our ecosystem,"" Android developer vice president of product management Matthew McCulloughwrote in a blog postannouncing the first developer preview. Google launched itsPixel 9 seriesin August this year rather than in October. As a result, Android 15 was notably absent from the phones when they went on sale. If Google plans to release the next Pixel lineup in the same time frame in 2025, it should overlap with the Android 16's earlier drop. Read more:Android 16 Will Launch Earlier Than Usual. Google's Android VP Explains Why This Android 16 developer preview has new features in its software release: the capability to be more selective in which photos an app has access to, an early version of an app's ability to read and write medical records with user consent, adaptable display refresh rate to reduce power consumption, more complex haptic effects and more. As this preview is more for app makers than app users, it gives developers time to tinker with and integrate the new features into their own apps well before an eventual Android 16 release. This preview resets the Android pre-release schedule to start previews in the last quarter of 2024, then a feature release in the first quarter of 2025, followed by the full release in the second quarter. More granularly, this breaks down to this first developer preview in November followed by a second in December, then beta releases for users enrolled in the Android Beta program every month from January through April (or into May) before a final release thereafter, according to the officialAndroid 16 overview page. Finally, a minor software update is coming in the fourth quarter of 2025. Google did not give a final list of which phones will be compatible with Android 16 but did note that the Android 16 developer preview can be used with the company'sPixel 6series of phones (including thePixel 6a) and newer devices up to thePixel 9andPixel 9 Pro Fold. This baseline of Pixel 6 phones is the same threshold of compatibility as last year's Android 15 developer beta. As long as you have a supported device, you can connect your phone to your computer and flash your device with Android 16 using theAndroid Flash Tool. The process is pretty straightforward and requires you to unlock your bootloader and follow prompts on both your phone and computer. If you're already on the first developer preview of Android 16, you can update OTA to the second DP.",Here's a sneak peek of what Android 16 will offer users in 2025.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/you-can-install-android-16-developer-preview-2-right-now-heres-whats-new/,
333,Best Quest 3 and Quest 3S Accessories: We’ve Played Hundreds of Hours and These Are Our Top Picks for Upgrades,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. TheMeta Quest 3is Meta's flagship VR headset and our all-aroundbest VR headsetthis year, while theQuest 3Sis a nice budget option to get you started in the VR world. Both can play VR and AR games, though the Quest 3 has better optics, so the games look a little better. Both suffer from the same issue: The head strap is not designed for comfort but for price. Thankfully, there are a lot of third-party accessories out there that can make it more comfortable or help you play longer and harder. If you are getting a Meta Quest thisholiday seasonfor yourself or someone as a gift, it's a good time to think about how you can level up that experience. We've been using these two headsets since they were released and testing as many accessories as possible and the best accessory is a really good headstrap. The Meta first-party head strap, theElite strap, is good already, but I find theYoges batteryhead strap more comfortable over long periods. Plus, the hot swap battery makes it easy to play for hours if you want to. One of the most important parts of a replacement head strap is to make playing for long periods more comfortable. While the Quest 3 is significantly lighter than the Quest 2, it is still a weight on the front of the face. Battery straps add weight -- with better support from the strap -- to the back of your head, reducing the pressure on the front. It's a much more comfortable experience. The Yoges strap has a 10,000mAh battery that continuously charges the Quest 3 while you play. The Meta Quest 3 has a 4879mAh battery, so the added battery should give another two full charges, adding around five to six hours of potential playtime. My mileage varies depending on what I'm doing, but I do get around five hours with my current testing setup. Meta's own headset strap system for the Quest 3 and 3S is my preferred alternative to the pack-in elastic straps, and it keeps a firm adjustable fit for extended use. There are third-party alternatives, too, but Meta's works well and fits easily in Meta's charging dock and carrying case. A more expensive version adds a battery pack, too. One concern I have over time is breakage. The Quest 2's elite strap system ended up wearing out and snapping over time. Unlike the official Meta Quest 3 charger, this one from Best Buy's brand Insignia can charge your controllers and the headset. The stand comes with two rechargeable batteries and covers for the controllers that feel as good as the original plates but make it easier to charge with the addition of pogo pins. The headset part uses the Quest 3's pogo pins to charge, so all you have to do is sit the headset into the slot when you've finished your session and it will be ready the next time you play. Make sure you seat it well, though, as the pins sometimes don't connect if you don't do it right.I really like the look of the Insignia dock over the official one, too. It's sleek and low profile with no extrusions to get caught. It's a simple product that does a great job. I like it. I do a lot of VR workouts, and while the Quest 3 and 3S have included wrist loops to keep the controllers from falling, Meta's active straps keep the controllers tight in hand at all times. The straps attach as a snap-on battery cover replacement on the controllers, with elastic velcro straps that feel cozy and allow full controller access. I've come to prefer these to Meta's pack-in wrist loops, and for active experiences like Supernatural, it feels like a must. One of my favorite games on the Quest is Pistol Whip. It's a rhythm game that uses music and shooting to make you feel like John Wick mowing down countless enemies. I use it as part of my fitness regimen during the week, as it can be a really good workout. The addition of the Cybvr has increased my workout by adding weight to the controllers. Because they are designed to feel like weapons in your hand, the weight is enough to make my arm muscles work hard as I play the game. The constant repetition not only helps me burn calories but also helps add definition to my arms — a win-win. The Cybvr also makes these gun games feel more realistic. One of my favorite AR games is Home Invasion -- a zombie game that has them attacking you in AR -- and the feel of the gun grips makes the whole experience more visceral. The only downside to these is the length of time it takes to remove the controllers. You have to completely disassemble the grips to get them out. I know the design reduces the risk of controller damage but it can be a pain when swapping games.  While plenty of fun accessories can enhance your VR gameplay, only a few are "" must-haves."" My first accessory purchase is always a new head strap. The ones that come with the Meta Quest and Meta Quest 3 are uncomfortable for any serious playtime. After that, you need a charging dock and, if possible, rechargeable batteries for the controllers. Nothing is worse than getting ready to use your headset only to find that the batteries in your controllers are dead. A good dock will make your life easier, your gameplay longer and your room tidier. Yes, most of the accessories you use for Meta Quest 3 don't affect your ability to wear glasses. The Quest 3 has an adjustable faceplate that lets you change its depth, allowing more room for glasses, so you no longer need the extra faceplate extender. If you are using a faceplate pad accessory, you can reduce the gap in the extender so your face is still the right distance away from the lenses. 3D printing allows you to customize your devices pretty heavily. There are several places to buy 3D parts, such as Etsy, and if you own a3D printer,you can print small, helpful things like cable clips all the way up to conversion systems to allow you to use HTC's impressive head straps. Removing the original head strap feels dangerous. It's well secured and requires more force than it feels right to use. Here's the best way to remove it without breaking anything. This procedure takes more force than you might think. To attach the new strap you will need to start at the other end of the headset, closest to the front. Clip the front part of the strap in and slowly push around the perimeter until the entire strap is connected. Attaching the new strap also takes a lot of force but once you get the first part attached it should go much easier.","The Quest 3 is the best VR headset you can buy right now, but there are a bunch of accessories that can make it better.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-quest-3-and-quest-3s-accessories/,

Or maybe you just don't want to risk damaging or losing your primary earbuds during certain activities, like working out at the gym (we have a list ofbest workout earbuds and headphones, too). Fortunately, affordable earbuds have significantly improved in recent years, with better sound, more features and performance that often exceeds expectations. I’ve personally tested all the budget earbuds on this list, which only includes earbuds that cost less than $100. I’ll keep updating this list as quality new affordablewireless earbudshit the market.

Performance You want the best-sounding earbuds with the best sound modes, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. While there are a few models that stand out from the pack, we currently have theSoundcore by Anker P40iat the top of this list. Beats' new no-frillsSolo Budsis a recent addition. Getting a decent pair doesn't require a high price tag anymore, so it’s difficult to name just one as the best overall pick. There are tons of wireless earbuds on the market, but many of the most popular options are quite pricey. But you don't have to spend hundreds to find a good pair of earbuds. Over the last 10 years, I've personally tested hundreds of budget wireless earbuds. In recent years, the quality of earbuds has drastically improved, offering better sound, more features and surprisingly good performance. Here are our top picks for the best budget earbuds that 2024 has to offer. Anker makes so many value earbuds it's hard to keep track of all of them. Released in early 2024, its Soundcore P40i buds are arguably the company's best budget earbuds, with a comfortable fit (they come with six sizes of ear tips) and very solid performance for around $50. Not only do they have decent active noise canceling as well as a transparency mode, but they offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity and respectable voice-calling capabilities. As far as sound goes, they're billed as ""bass heavy"" earbuds, and indeed, they deliver pretty powerful bass, though it's not boomy or muddy and there is ample detail. They just lean a little warm You can tweak the sound a bit in the sound profile, but I mainly stuck to the earbuds' ""signature sound,"" which I thought worked well with a wide variety of music genres. Worth noting: They have a pretty wide sound stage and low-latency modes for movie watching and gaming. As a bonus feature, the earbuds' charging case converts into a stand for your smartphone when watching video. That's a feature more earbuds cases should have. Equipped with wireless and USB-C charging, battery life is rated for up to 12 hours at moderate volume levels, but the number dips to more like 8 hours with noise canceling on. The buds are IPX5 splash-resistant (they can survive a sustained spray of water). Available in four color options, the Solo Buds are missing some key features found in more premium buds, including a battery in their very compact charging case, ear-detection sensors and active noise canceling. But they get the fundamentals right. They're lightweight and not only offer decent sound quality and strong battery life but very good voice-calling performance that rivals what you get with the company's more expensive Studio Buds Plus. Earfun is one of our go-to brands for value earbuds. Its Air Pro 4 buds aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Pleaseclip the on-page couponto receive the full 20% off at checkout.) Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs. Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much. As I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio). I do think the voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. SCORE New for 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than 2022's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise canceling and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory, it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered a more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splashproof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise canceling and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good-performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging. What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at five hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof. These are listed for $60 but are currently on sale with a 25% on-page coupon, that’ll bring your total down to around $35. This is a very good deal if you're looking for open-style earbuds. Amazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that ofApple's AirPods 3, which deliver better bass performance and overall fuller, cleaner sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 4, even the entry-level mode ($129), cost significantly more. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or ""semi-open"" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale for $35. SCORE Jabra has replaced its entry-level Elite 3 buds with the new-for-2023 Elite 4, which offers active noise canceling and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. What's a little confusing is that Jabra also sells theElite 4 Active, a slightly more ruggedized version of the same buds that carries a list price of $120 but sometimes sells for less than the standard Elite 4. So get the Elite 4 Active if it costs less. The lightweight Elite 4 fit my ears comfortably and offered good, well-balanced sound with punchy bass and decent clarity. They support Qualcomm's AptX audio codec (for Android and other devices that support AptX) but only the SBC codec for iPhones (no AAC support). The Elite 4 is missing more premium features like ear detection sensors and has a four-microphone array for noise canceling and voice calls (voice-calling performance is good but not exceptionally good). Battery life is rated at up to seven hours at moderate volume levels and the buds have an IP55 water-resistance rating, which means they can take a sustained spray of water and are also dust-resistant. As with a lot of other new buds, you can use either bud independently in a mono mode. I didn't try the original Soundpeats GoFree earbuds, but the second-gen GoFree 2s deliver a good value, with decent sound for open earbuds that sit on top of your ears -- there's a touch of distortion at higher volumes, but they have ample bass. While they don't quite look or feel like premium buds, they also don't look or feel cheap. They're missing premium features like ear-detection sensors (when you take one off, your music doesn't automatically pause), and their companion app for iOS and Android is a bit underwhelming. I found them pretty comfortable to wear (they fit securely) and their touch controls worked well. They're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, have support for the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android phones that support it, and are IPX5 splash-proof. Battery life is rated up to nine hours at moderate volume levels and their case is one of the more compact cases I've seen for these types of earbuds. I thought voice-calling performance was acceptable, although not great. These are open earbuds, so they do let sound in, and it can be a little hard to hear callers in noisier environments. Be sure toclip the on-page couponto get 20% off. The Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. However, they don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. Fully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 have slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent thought not exceptionally good. The Tranya T20 remind me a little of a cheaper version of Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 without the noise canceling. They're pretty no-frills and missing more premium features such as an ear-detection sensor that automatically pauses your music when you take a bud out of your ears. But they sound surprisingly decent for their modest price, if you get a tight seal, they sit pretty flush with your ears (they don't really stick out much) and they have decent battery life -- up to eight hours at moderate volume levels. They also work pretty well for making calls and are IPX7 waterproof. The case feels a little cheap and the buds are lightweight. The Galaxy Buds 2 definitely feel more premium. However, the buds are well-tuned and have a relatively wide soundstage. Don't expect the world from them and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out just how ""budget"" your budget wireless earbuds should be. Value priced earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" buds for not too much money, like many on this list. But if you're looking for more premium budget earbuds from Sony, Apple and Bose, be prepared to upwards of $60. It's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise canceling can be dramatically impacted for the worse. Open earbuds don't have that issue, but they should be comfortable to wear and sit securely in your ears. You want earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important with budget earbuds, which are more susceptible to damage because of their design. You want the best-sounding earbuds with the best sound modes, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. It's critical to buy your budget earbuds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. We test budget true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,features,voice-calling performanceandvalue. We assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings, which are especially important for budgetearbuds and headphones you may take to the gym. Even budget earbuds can still deliver great sounding audio. We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment. Many budget earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. This is especially important for those who want a cheaper earbud to throw in their work bag. We determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Because many of these models fall into a similar price range, we break the price classes further to ensure they're matched appropriately. Our reviewer David Carnoy testing voice-calling performance on the noisy streets of New York. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's newLive Pro 2andLive Free 2buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. JBL Live Free 2: Like theLive Pro 2, JBL's new Live Free 2 buds are surprisingly good. With 11mm drivers, six microphones, oval tubes and oval silicon tips, they combine a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance. Features include multipoint Bluetooth pairing and wireless charging, and they're rated for up to seven hours with IPX5 water-resistance (splash-proof). Beats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio Buds look a lot like the rumored stemless AirPods some people have been waiting for. Geared toward both iOS and Android users, they are missing a few key features on the Apple side of things (there's no H1 or W1 chip), but they're small, lightweight buds that are comfortable to wear and offer really good sound. While their noise canceling isn't as good as the AirPods Pro's, they do have a transparency mode and they're decent for making calls.Read our Beats Studio Buds review. Sennheiser CX: If you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, the CX are a good alternative, though they have . They feature very good sound, plus decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance. The only issue is they stick out of your ears a bit and may not fit some smaller ears. This model, which often sells for less than $100 on Amazon, doesn't feature active noise canceling but the step-up CX Plus does (theCX Plusis also a good value, particularly when it goes on sale). Apple improved the sound quality of thethird-gen AirPodsso it raised the bar. That said, many true wireless earbuds that cost less than $100 or even less than $50 offer surprisingly good sound for the money and measure up pretty well against the AirPods andAirPods Pro, although not theAirPods Pro 2, which offer significantly improved sound. Often, the biggest difference is build quality. Premium buds tend to feel sturdier and tend to be built with more premium materials. They also have a more premium look and feel to both the buds themselves and their charging case. In theory, premium buds should hold up better over time. Additionally, they tend to have more features such as ear-detection sensors and they pair with a companion app so you can upgrade the firmware (as well as tweak the sound and possibly customize the controls). Finally, while some cheaper buds have active noise cancellation, the performance of the noise-canceling and transparency modes tends to be better with more premium buds. Some do. Many cheaper buds now feature multiple microphones and some do a surprisingly good job when it comes to voice calling. A few models on this list have surprisingly good noise reduction and measure up well against the AirPods, which are known for their strong voice-calling performance. There are several ways to improve the sound of even the cheapest earbuds. Here are just a few:",Shopping for new earbuds for yourself or someone special on your gift list?

The Reds were held to a draw by Fulham on Saturday, allowing title rivals Chelsea to eat into their lead at the top of the EPL. They now turn their attention to a tournament that was the last that former manager Jürgen Klopp won while in charge of the club. They're favorites to win again this season.

339,FTC's Junk Fees Ban for Tickets and Travel to Go Into Effect by Next Summer,"The Federal Trade Commissionhas finalizedan initiative itbegan in 2022 at the urging of the Bidenadministration to eliminate ""junk fees"" at hotels, short-term rentals and for tickets to events such as concerts, it announced Tuesday. The so-calledTrade Regulation Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Feeswould limit hidden convenience and service fees, such as those typically charged when booking event tickets or lodging rentals. It would also require companies to be more transparent about their pricing and fees, including in advertising. The finalized rule language would go into effect 120 days after it's published in the Federal Register, which typically takes a few days. That means the rule would be active before next summer's travel season. The commission said it received more than 12,000 comments from consumers on how junk fees affect their spending or business. It expects to save US consumers 50 million hours per year in time wasted on pricing searches. Last year, some major players in those industries, including Ticketmaster and Airbnb, agreed to adhere to these concepts even before the rules were finalized. The ticket and lodging fee rules follow other major consumer-protection acts by the FTC and the Federal Aviation Administration, including rules thatmake it easier to cancel service subscriptionsand rulestargeting airline refunds for canceled flights. The FTC alsotook actionthis week against the food-delivery service Grubhub in the state of Illinois. Grubhub will pay $25 million to settle charges that the company deceived diners over delivery costs and deceived workers about how much money they would make. For the new FTC rule on lodging and ticket junk fees, the commission voted 4 to 1 in favor of publication of the final rule. The dissenting vote was from Andrew Ferguson, who has been chosen by President-elect Donald Trumpto replace current chair Lina Khan. In his dissenting statement(PDF), Ferguson said it was ""inappropriate"" to pass such rules before a new administration takes over. ""I dissent only on the grounds that the time for rulemaking by the Biden-Harris FTC is over,"" he wrote. It's unclear if the leadership change will affect this or other consumer-protection rules put in place during the Biden administration.","The commission says the new rules will save people time and money, with more transparent pricing and fewer hidden fees.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ftcs-junk-fees-ban-for-tickets-and-travel-to-go-into-effect-by-next-summer/,
340,"If You Need a Last-Minute Holiday Gift, AI Can Help You Make One","So, you waited until the very last minute to getgiftstogether for the ho-ho-hogift-giving season. You've missed the shipping deadlines and you also don't want (or can't afford) to spend any money on thosegiftsyou waited until the last minute to not get. Whether this is your first time on the Naughty Not-Gift-Giving list or you're a repeat offender, there's still plenty of opportunity to stay in the good graces of the people you care about most this season. Here's a list of gifts you can create usingartificial intelligencetools that might distract your loved ones from the fact that you didn'twrapit yourself. Not many people have the money or connections to commission an artist and a professional writer to create a holiday-themed bedtime story or coloring book just for the little kids or very bored adults in their lives. Through the power of AI, you can create a special bedtime tradition that can be passed down through generations with onlyChatGPTand the free online design tool,Canva, as your resources. Here's how: Step 1:Log into ChatGPT, or any other text prompt-based AI chat tool, and ask it to write you a short story using the names and preferences of kids and adults alike as major themes or elements. For my experiment, I asked it to write me a short children's bedtime story with a holiday theme where the main character is a fire truck named Henry whose parents are named Jennifer and Andrew. ChatGPT immediately produced a 500-word story that was actually pretty good. Step 2:Make any edits you might need to make to the story ChatGPT comes up with. Step 3:Create an account and log into Canva's free Magic Media tool, a text-to-image generator. Step 4:Copy and paste the text from the story from ChatGPT into Canva and select the images you'd like to accompany each page. You don't even have to know how to boil water to give a unique cookbook to the wannabe celebrity chef in your life, and you couldcreate a cookbook of recipesdesigned entirely and specifically for one individual using AI tools. Step 1:Ask ChatGPT or another text prompt-based AI tool of your choosing to give you as many recipes as it can think of using a certain favorite ingredient or preferred dish. Step 2:Use a free AI text-to-image generator, likeopenart.ai, to add some imagery to the sumptuous procedurally generated recipes and create a cover for your custom cookbook. Step 3:Drop these images and recipes into a Word document or Google Docs, print to PDF and send it along to the gourmet-minded gift recipient. Sometimes the holidays can be a little hard when weremember loved oneslong passed, but AI tools likeRunwayML, which use generative algorithms to turn still images into live-action footage, offer a window into a world in which you might get to see a video of that person smiling again. Step 1:Sign up or log into RunwayML. Step 2:Select Start a New Session. Step 3:Upload an image of the person, pet or other scene you'd like to animate. Step 4:Give the tool some information about what you'd like to happen in the animation and click ""Generate."" Step 5:Download and share If you're worried these AI-produced gifts won't pass muster this holiday season, just remember the best things in life are free, it's the thought that counts and at the rate online activity is evolving, in-real-life gifts may be old hat next year anyway.

Its new deal with Sony brings theatrical releases like Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and Godzilla Minus One to stream, alongside standout originals like the holiday romp Hot Frosty, and the Golden Globe-nominated Emilia Pérez, starring Selena Gomez, Karla Sofía Gascón and Zoe Saldaña. Here are 14 of the best movies you can watch on Netflix right now, including some fun holiday favorites for the season. If you'd rather go with a series, check out our picks for thebest TV shows to watch on Netflix. Read more:Where to Watch All the 2024 Oscar Winners This biographical film nabbed seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. Maestro tells the story of conductor Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and his relationship with actor Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). In addition to starring in the romance drama, Cooper also directed and co-wrote the film, and produced it alongside Hollywood legends like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Former Marine Terry Richmond heads into a small town to bail his cousin out of jail where local law enforcement illegally seizes his cash. Tensions mount and corruption reigns as he uncovers a deeper conspiracy that involves murder, collusion and greed. Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. Set in 1945, the story centers Kōichi Shikishima, a young pilot dealing with PTSD in a post-World War II era. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. The Sony film is available to stream on Netflix now. The award-winning film, Society of the Snow, is based on true events and adapted from the book of the same name. In 1972, a rugby team from Uruguay boarded a plane to Chile for a game. The plane crashed in the Andes mountains, leaving survivors to contend with injuries, illness, cold temperatures and death. Not everyone makes it, and those facing death make agonizing choices to live. If you weren't around at the time, it's hard to explain just how huge ""We  Are the World"" was. Recorded by a supergroup of popular  musicians—assembled on the fly on the night of the 1985 American Music  Awards—the charity single benefiting Ethiopian famine victims sold over  20 million copies and featured the likes of Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and Diana Ross. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.) Luckily for us, there were  cameras rolling the entire time as dozens of the world's most famous  musicians pulled the epic all-night recording session. The recently  departed Quincy Jones proves the night's true star, wrangling a studio  full of nerves, egos, and a little too much wine to produce something  genuinely special. A standalone sequel to 2019's hit film Knives Out, Glass Onion follows detective Benoit Blanc's (Daniel Craig) mission to uncover a mysterious death, after tech billionaire Miles Bron (Edward Norton) invites friends to his private Greek island. The film features fun plot twists, and is broken up by lighthearted humor and aloof characters played by an all-star cast. An absorbingly unsettling psychological thriller, Leave the World Behind chronicles the strange events that arise during a family's getaway at an opulent rental home. A blackout renders their phones, TVs and other electronics useless, and two strangers show up at the door. TikTok has been flooded with clips and analyses of this apocalypse movie, with people reflecting on potential ""hidden messages"" and real-life parallels. Check it out and see what you make of it. Selena Gomez, Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón star in Emilia Pérez, a film that earned a whopping ten Golden Globe nominations this year, including Best Picture, Best Director, and nods for all three of its lead actors. In the film, Gascón stars as Mexican cartel leader Emilia who hires a lawyer named Rita  (Saldaña) to help fake  her death so that Emilia can finally live authentically as her true  self. The crime-comedy-musical that defies all labels was also named one of the ten best films of 2024 by AFI. This animated drama, based on the graphic novel of the same name, is set in a futuristic medieval world, in which a knight (Riz Ahmed) is framed for a crime. A shapeshifting teenager named Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) — whom he's been trained to destroy — may be his only hope for proving his innocence. This biographical film tells the story of two sisters, Yusra (Nathalie Issa) and Sarah Mardini (Manal Issa), who escape war-torn Syria. Amid all the strife and upheaval, Yusra works toward her dream of swimming in the Olympics. It's a touching narrative of hope and survival. A World War I drama based on the classic novel of the same name, this epic depicts the horrors of war through the eyes of 17-year-old German soldier Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer). At first enthused about joining the army — in spite of his parents' wishes — Bäumer gets a violent wake-up call. All Quiet on the Western Front was a dominating force at the 95th Annual Academy Awards, as it was nominated for nine Oscars and ultimately walked away with four, including Best International Feature Film. Annette Bening and Jodie Foster both scored Oscar nominations (for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively) for their roles in NYAD, the Netflix original film about marathon swimmer Diana Nyad and her devoted coach Bonnie Stoll. The remarkable true story is not a full biopic but a chapter of Nyad's accomplished life when, at the age of 60, Nyad  became obsessed with completing the arduous, near-impossible 110 mile swim from Cuba to Florida. Determined to become the first person to finish the  swim without a shark cage, the film is a story of Nyad's determination, ushered along by the support of those closest to her. Netflix is known for its original holiday movies and the streaming giant has put out some popular ones for several years now. With its latest Christmas movie, Hot Frosty, the company goes full fan service, referencing many of those older films, including Falling for Christmas and A Christmas Prince (there's a sly Mean Girls joke, too). It's also giving fans of family-friendly Hallmark holiday movies a little more skin than they're used to. When Kathy (Lacey Chabert) places an enchanted scarf on a snowman with chiseled abs (just go with it), it comes to life and she finds purpose and joy while he's around. The almost perpetually shirtless snowman, Jack, is played by Schitt's Creek star Dustin Milligan, and let's just say he's been working out alotsince he played Ted. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was not just one of the best animated movies of 2023, it was one of the best films of the year, period. The animated superhero movie brings together various versions of Peter Parker/Spider-Man from across time and space, using a portal to connect their worlds as they battle the supervillain known as The Spot. Jam-packed with dozens of famous voices, from Shameik Moore to Jason Schwartzman and Hailee Steinfeld, the film is the first half of an epic saga that'll conclude with Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, which may not arrive until 2027.","We've got award winners, family flicks and some festive holiday fun on this week's watch list.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-movies-on-netflix/,
342,Forget an iPhone Flip. I Want a Foldable iPad Instead,"Would you rather have aniPhonethat opens up into a tiny iPad, a regular iPhone that folds in half, or a giantiPadyou can fold up and take with you? It may be an unpopular opinion, but I'd choose the foldable iPad -- and there are good reasons why. AniPhone Fold or Flipmight sound appealing in theory, and foldable phones can be an ideal choicefor the right type of buyer. But as today'sfoldableshave proven, phones that bend in half come with some pretty hefty caveats. For one, book-style foldables never feel quite like a regular phone when closed. When opened, you get a relatively small tablet with a visible crease running down the middle -- for a price that's roughly twice the cost of a standard phone.Flip phones, meanwhile, don't have much to offer beyond their more pocketable size and the ability to take selfies more easily. I'm not saying a foldable iPad would be perfect, nor am I arguing that it wouldn't be expensive. But if Apple truly is workingon a massive iPad-like devicethat folds in half, as reports fromBloombergandThe Wall Street Journalindicate, there are a lot of possibilities that could make it truly compelling. TheiPad Prois already a somewhat niche and expensive device designed for productivity, creativity and entertainment. Giving it an even bigger screen that folds in half would only build on that purpose, rather than trying to cram a phone and tablet experience into one device. Plus, Apple's track record with theApple Pencilsuggests it could develop custom accessories for a foldable iPad that would let you use it in new ways. The iPad started as a means to bridge the gap between two existing devices: phones and laptops. A foldable iPad would probably follow a similar path, serving as something that falls in between a tablet and a laptop. In that sense, it's the natural evolution of the original iPad from nearly 15 years ago. Apple wouldn't be the first to try blending laptops and tablets; Lenovo and Asus already sell Windows-powered slates that can fold in half. But if Apple maintains the approach it's taken with the original iPad, it could succeed where both smartphone and PC makers have fallen short thus far. Read more:What's Next for iPhones? Apple Seems to Have Big Plans in 2025 The iPad Pro is still a big blank slate of potential. There's no reason Apple couldn't reinvent it further. The goal behind a foldable iPad would likely be to provide a massive screen that you can reasonably carry with you. The largest size for most laptops is usuallyaround 17 or 18 inches, and oftentimes those are heavy-duty laptops meant for gaming or productivity, and they don't always have the longest battery life. In other words, there aren't many options out there for those who just want a big, lightweight screen they can carry with them without much fuss. Companies like Lenovo and Asus are already trying to address this issue with their own foldable tablets, such as theThinkPadX1 Fold 16andZenbook Fold 17 OLED. But those devices are expensive and come with their own fair share of shortcomings, such as the ThinkPad's poor battery life and cramped display in laptop mode and the Zenbook's somewhat clunky build. Apple's own take on a foldable tablet could measure about 19 inches, making it nearly as large as a desktop monitor when unfolded, according toThe Wall Street Journal.Bloombergreports that the company has a foldable iPad in the works that's about the size of two iPad Pros put together that could launch in 2028. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold is one of the few foldable tablets out there. One reason why a foldable iPad could be more appealing than a foldable iPhone -- which Apple is also said to be working on --  is because our relationship with tablets is much different than with smartphones.Tabletsare meant to be a secondary, in-between type of device, while smartphones are arguably the most important gadgets in our lives. A 2020 survey from texting serviceSimpleTextingfound that 44% of millennials would rather be separated from their significant other for a month than their smartphone. I don't think anyone would say the same for their tablet or laptop. That gives Apple more leeway to experiment with the iPad. If your phone feels too heavy, is too difficult to use with one hand, dies quickly or has a giant crease running down the middle of it, you're probably going to run out of patience much sooner than you would with a tablet. Perhaps that partially explains why foldable phones are still a niche even in 2024, roughly half a decade after Samsung's first foldable phone arrived. Foldable phone shipments are expected to reach 25 million units in 2024, according to theInternational Data Corporation, representing a sliver of the 1.24 billion smartphonesthe firm estimateswill ship this year. ACNET surveyin partnership with YouGov also found that 52% of smartphone owners aren't interested in buying a foldable phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has come a long way and feels much more like a regular phone when closed. But it's still not quite there, and it's even more expensive than its predecessor. Apple already targets specific audiences with theiPad, particularly when it comes to the larger Pro models aimed at artists and musicians looking to get work done on the go. And tablets in general have a more focused use case than phones; they're generally designed for watching movies, web browsing, reading books, playing games or doing light work when you don't want to lug around your laptop. Those are the exact types of scenarios you'd want a larger screen for, which is the biggest benefit most foldables bring. Yes, most people use their phones for those very same tasks, but usually out of necessity and convenience rather than preference. There's no arguing that reading a book or streamingNetflixon a tablet is going to be a better experience than on a tiny 6-inch phone screen. Additionally, Apple's iPad software is already designed for hybrid devices in a sense. While Apple doesn't have a true alternative to the two-in-one laptops you'd find in the Windows world, it's been gradually adding more productivity-oriented tools to make it feel more like a Mac. TakeStage Manager, for example, which organizes apps with the hope of making them feel more like using windows on a desktop. Apple also offers versions of its video and music editing software,Final Cut ProandLogic Pro, for the iPad that are almost as capable as the Mac versions. Applegave the iPad its own operating systemin 2019 after years of lumping it in with iOS, perhaps laying the foundation for software that's meant to evolve and change to fit new types of devices. At the same time, the Mac's interface has evolved to feel more like the iPhone's and iPad's, in yet another sign that Apple wants to make its desktop and mobile experiences more consistent with one another while keeping them separate -- for better or worse. Read more:Why Apple's Future Could Depend on Siri The Pencil Pro brings up a contextual menu on-screen when squeezed, when apps that have been upgraded add support for it. Apple, of course, will have its fair share of obstacles to overcome. While Apple's software strategy could be one of its biggest advantages, there's also a chance it could make the iPad feel even more confusing. The iPad Pro feels caught in a strange place because it can't quite do everything your laptop can but comes frustratingly close to doing so, as my colleague Scott Steinhas written about at length. Apple should look at a foldable iPad as an opportunity to solve this problem rather than exacerbating the iPad's sometimes ambiguous role. Not to mention, a massive screen likely will require a massive battery. Early foldable phones like the originalSamsung Galaxy Foldsuffered from poor battery life, underscoring the technical hurdles that often come with developing a new category of devices. It's a challenge that may be easier for Apple to navigate now that it's begun putting its own M-series chips, which also power its MacBooks and provide huge gains in battery life over Intel's chips, inside its high-end iPads. But there are some factors working in Apple's favor. For one, Apple already dominates the tablet space with 31.7% of the global market, according toThe International Data Corporation, making it the world's biggest tablet seller. If anyone is going to convince shoppers to splurge on a fancy new foldable tablet, it could be Apple -- even though a foldable iPad will undoubtedly be wildly expensive. Plus, Apple's approach in thinking of the iPad as its own type of device rather than a laptop that folds in half could result in more compelling software. Not only would you have a bigger canvas for apps and games, but I could imagine Apple adding new elements to the user interface to make the iPad feel more like a laptop alternative. It also opens up a lot of possibilities for Apple to develop new accessories that make the most of having a large screen you can take with you. What about a desktop stand that props the iPad up on your desk, making it resemble aniMac? I'd love to see Apple take a page from Microsoft's playbook with theSurface Dialthe Windows PC maker introduced for itsSurface Studioall-in-one PC nearly a decade ago. With its puck-shaped attachment, Microsoft proposed a novel and clever way to interact with a giant display beyond just tapping and swiping. The Surface Dial was a clever take on how to navigate a giant screen. My biggest criticism about foldable phones is that it doesn't feel like the software has caught up to the hardware. Many of the features that make foldables unique -- like the ability to split apps between the top and bottom portions of the screen -- seem more like an answer to a problem foldables created rather than a reason to buy one. But Apple has been morphing the iPad's software for years to make it feel more like a hybrid computer that can take over some of your Mac's duties. That makes me hope it'll have a more intriguing vision for how software should work compared to what we've seen from foldable phone and PC makers so far. Perhaps Steve Jobs said it best when announcingthe first iPadin 2010. ""The bar is pretty high,"" he said minutes before introducing Apple's original tablet. ""In order to really create a new category of devices, those devices are going to have to be far better at doing some key tasks."" If a foldable iPad is in Apple's future, let's hope it follows that guiding principle.","Commentary: A foldable iPad would feel like an evolution of Apple's tablet, unlike foldable phones which can feel like two experiences crammed together.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/forget-an-iphone-flip-i-want-a-foldable-ipad-instead/,

344,I Tried AI to See How I'll Age. It Wasn't as Bad as I Expected,"I'm one of those women who believes in ageing gracefully. There's nothing more attractive than someone who can wear their age well. While society idolizes youth and normalizes young people getting preventative treatments to ""stay young,"" some argue it's having theopposite effect-- making 20-year-olds look 30. Fillers are frightening to me, but will I regret not getting them when I'm 50? I thought I'd ask artificial intelligence, with all that it can do. I've used it tochange my hair color,predict my future baby's faceandcreate headshots. Surely it can show me a realistic version of my aged face. A quick search for ""old age face app"" in the App Store led me toFaceApp, which has been around since way before AI was cool. The Cyprus-based FaceApp Technology launched the app in 2017, allowing you to transform your face with old and young filters. FaceApp is accessible for free, but there are feature limitations. For premium filters, no watermarks and faster processing, upgrade to FaceApp Pro. It's $10 per month, or if you pay for the 12 months in full, it's $5 per month. There's a one-week free trial available. I'm happy to pay $10 to save me a lifetime with wrinkles, but I started with the free version. I was in no state to take a selfie, so I chose a few photos from my camera roll. Given AI apps are usually picky with photo quality, I selected four to upload. Once I uploaded the images, it instantly added the FaceApp watermark to each one, given I was on the free plan. The features were easy to find, with a simple banner of prompts to select. I could change my face size, skin, expression, hair, gender and age. I clicked on Age and it had eight face prompts available, from young to teen to old. I picked ""cool old"" first to soften the blow. Baby steps. First impression? I'm wearing too much makeup. Oh, and I look like my grandma. The original photo of me (far left), the AI-generated ""cool old"" version (middle) and AI's ""old old"" version (right). Now onto the second. Me now (far left), the AI-generated ""cool old"" version (middle) and AI's ""old old"" version (right). What this one nailed was the vertical line between my eyebrows and my crow's feet. My dad has these lines and he's 70. He's also got a full head of hair, so it's good to see my AI old age filter with fab hair. Onto the third try. This one's not bad at all. Me now (far left), ""cool old"" (middle) and ""old old"" (right). Onto the lucky last. Ageing with that hair? Not bad at all. Me now (far left), ""cool old"" (middle) and ""old old"" (right). While it's fun to see how AI predicts I'll age, I wanted to take it further to get feedback on what I can do about it. Can ChatGPT tell me my problem areas and suggest askin care regimen? I openedChatGPTand uploaded the four old-age images from FaceApp with this prompt: ""Here are four AI-generated old age filter photos of me. This is how AI predicts I'll age. Based on the visible aging in these photos, identify the problem areas and provide a personalized regime that I can do now, to avoid my skin aging to this extent. I don't want generic advice."" ChatGPT gave me the standardskin care routineadvice, but did put an emphasis on avitamin C serumin the morning to brighten the skin andvitamin Ain the evening. Forpreventive treatments, it suggestedmicroneedling, laser therapy,chemical peelsandBotox. I asked ChatGPT if I needed Botox or if goodskin carewould suffice. ChatGPT suggested to see how my skin responds to good skincare over the next two years and if dynamic lines deepen, it's time for Botox. Ouch. Given that I'm nontox obsessed, I asked ChatGPT if there's a natural alternative to Botox. It gave me some options such asfacial acupuncture, natural wrinkle relaxers (bakuchiol,argirelineandaloe vera), acollagen-rich dietandnoninvasive treatmentslikemicrocurrent devicesandLED light therapy. I asked what the most natural cosmetic procedures are, and I got this list: To summarize, ChatGPT suggested three top nontox treatments based on my photos: It's handy to be able to use AI to get a sense of how I'll age, then put it into achatbotto talk through preventive strategies. While AI image generators might be way off, it can help with the decisions I make now in how I care for my skin and hair -- though you should definitely speak to a dermatologist before making any decisions. Maybe I just need to age with dignity and change my mindset, not my face.

345,Best Cheap VPN for 2024: Privacy on a Budget,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. Factors to consider in a cheap VPN  Internet speed loss By nature of encrypting your traffic, all VPNs lower your internet somewhat, but the fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%. Cost VPNs range in price from $5 to $15 per month, $40 to $100 per year or $80-plus for a two-plus year plan. Usually, you'll save the most with a two-plus year subscription, but we recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. The best wallet-friendly VPNs only set you back $40 to $60 annually. Privacy Look for features like kill switches, DNS leak protection and strict no-logging policies backed up by third-party audits. Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. And VPNs that publish regular transparency reports are even better choices for privacy-concerned users. Server network Look at the overall number of servers as well as the individual country locations. On the high end, the most comprehensive VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries should work for many folks. Device support Most VPN companies offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. Think about the devices you want to install a VPN on, and make sure your VPN provider supports those gadgets. Streaming capabilities VPNs can be great for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock, Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad. On the flip side, VPNs unlock access to foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfsharkdelivers innovative privacy features, a polished interface, unlimited simultaneous connections, fast speeds and an impressive global network of VPN servers in 100 countries -- all while offering long-term subscription plans that are considerably cheaper than many of its competitors. Although Surfshark’s monthly plan is expensive at $15.45 per month, you can enjoy significant savings if you sign up for a year or longer. Following an introductory price of $48 for the first year, the annual plan renews at $60 per year. You can also opt for a two-year plan that costs $60 for the first two years combined and then recurs annually at $60. Surfshark offers ad and malware protection, camouflage mode andsplit tunneling. You’ll also get standard features like DNS leak protection, AES 256-bit encryption (with the OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 with WireGuard and akill switch. The company’s Nexus Network can help enhance user privacy even further by facilitating features like Dynamic MultiHop and IP Rotator. Surfshark is an excellent option forstreamingas well and can help you unblock multiple Netflix libraries along with other streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Hulu. Alongside its VPN service, Surfshark provides ad-blocking, a personal detail generator and masked email generator. You can get a seven-day free trial onAndroid,iOSandMacOSif you sign up through Google's Play Store or Apple's App Store. If you've purchased Surfshark and you're not satisfied with the service for any reason, the VPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE Private Internet Accessis an OG VPN provider based in the United States. Its software is fully open-source and its apps are highly customizable, making PIA a solid choice for the techie crowd and privacy-conscious folks who appreciate transparency. It’s also one of the cheapest premium VPN providers around, at $12 per month, $40 per year or $80 every three years. PIA had itsno-logs policyindependently audited in 2024, regularly releasestransparency reportsand has had its no-logs claims tested in the wild on multiple occasions. Along with standard privacy features like AES 256-bit encryption with OpenVPN and IKEv2 or ChaCha20 on WireGuard, DNS leak protection and a kill switch, PIA also offers multihop connections,obfuscation, and an ad and malware blocker. Its large server network spanning 91 countries worldwide makes PIA a greatVPN for travel, while its unlimited simultaneous connections mean it's a good virtual private network solution formultiple devices. In our latest testing, we experienced uneven connectivity, with a high 49% average internet speed loss. By comparison, Surfshark is much faster than PIA. In any case, PIA is an excellent cheap VPN that provides top-notch privacy and is more than capable of handling almost anything you’d want to do online. Like Surfshark, PIA has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Open-source VPN for privacy-focused users SCORE Mullvadis an open-source VPN provider that offers its services at a competitive rate. Mullvad's simple pricing structure is vastly different than most others. The service costs a flat fee of $5 per month, whether you use it for a month, a year, 10 years or longer. That comes out to $60 for a year, which matches Surfshark's regular yearly subscription price. Because Mullvad says it strives to know as little about its customers as possible, it has completely done away with recurring subscriptions so it cannot hang onto payment data longer than necessary. You can even mail Mullvad an envelope with cash to pay for the service. Mullvad automatically generates a random 16-digit account number when you sign up, and you can prepay for one, two, three, six or 12 months at a time. The company is so focused on security and privacy that you don't have to enter any personal data at signup -- no email, username or password is required. Mullvad is fast and offers excellent privacy, but isn't ideal for streaming enthusiasts because it doesn't offer full native support for smart TVs or streaming devices and sometimes struggles to stream certain content. I streamed content on Netflix, Hulu and Disney Plus without any issues during my tests, but Amazon Prime Video detected the VPN and blocked my access. It's otherwise an excellent option for budget-conscious VPN users who value extra attention to privacy and appreciate straightforward simplicity. Similar to PIA and Surfshark, Mullvad offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Surfsharkis CNET’s top pick for the best cheap VPN, thanks to its innovative feature set, outstanding speed performance, top-notch privacy protections and budget-friendly annual subscription plan. Surfshark is easy to use across all platforms and is excellent for streaming -- especially if you want to maximize yourNetflix viewingoptions. Granted, Surfshark’s monthly subscription is quite a bit more expensive than the competition, but if you sign up for an annual or two-year plan, you’ll pay far less than what you would for most other top VPNs’ long-term subscriptions. Surfshark isn't just one of the top affordable VPNs -- it's one of the best VPNs on the market, period. Surfshark's app delivers tons of features at a budget-friendly price. Private Internet Access, or PIA, is another solid budget-friendly VPN that has a strong reputation for privacy and transparency. PIA's apps have lots of options for customization and are simple to use. It's also a great option for streaming, but users with slow connections may struggle with PIA's rather slow speed performance. Nevertheless, PIA is an excellent cheap VPN at just $40 per year. PIA's apps offer a lot of options for customization. Mullvadrounds out our list of the best cheap VPNs. Its fast speeds, easy-to-use app and innovative privacy features all for a flat fee of $5 per month make this Swedish-based provider a great choice for privacy-conscious users on a budget. It's decent for streaming, but Mullvad struggles with some streaming services and doesn't offer full native app support for smart TVs or streaming devices. It's an otherwise well-rounded privacy-focused VPN that's a fantastic bargain. Mullvad's app is clean and simple to use. Here's how the best cheap VPNs stack up by price. Price is an important consideration for most people for most purchases, including VPNs. When VPN prices vary wildly from provider to provider and generally range between $5 to $15 per month or anywhere from $40 to $100 or more per year, how do you know which VPN is actually good -- and worth the price? What I've learned over the past decade testing and using VPNs is that, like with a lot of things, there isn't necessarily a direct correlation between a VPN's quality and its price. I've encountered several expensive, overpriced VPNs that turned out to be severely inadequate in virtually every possible way -- think buggy apps, slow speeds and poor privacy for upwards of $100 per year. On the other hand, some of the best VPNs on the planet deliver premium performance and innovative features at a refreshingly budget-friendly price. There are excellent VPNs for every budget, so you don't need to break the bank to get a premium-quality VPN service. If you're looking to stretch your dollar, I'd recommend opting for a yearly subscription plan in most cases rather than going month-to-month because you'll usually enjoy greater savings in the long run. VPN companies typically offer a variety of subscription plan lengths -- most commonly monthly, yearly and two-year plans -- with the longest normally offering the most savings. I don't recommend signing on with any VPN provider for longer than a year at a time because of how quickly things tend to shift in the VPN industry. VPNs get bought and sold, terms of service may change, performance may fluctuate, features may come and go -- or your VPN service may cease to operate altogether. The cheap VPNs I've highlighted on this page are all excellent, top-tier options that cater to a wide variety of use cases. Best of all, each one is supremely gentle on your pocketbook. Based on our experience testing, using and researching VPNs, these are the most important factors to consider when choosing the best cheap VPN for your needs. Cost If your objective is to find the cheapest VPN for your needs, then the cost of the VPN will likely be your primary consideration. Some VPNs cost up to $100 or more per year, but the cheapest VPNs give you many of the same features, usability and privacy protections for just $40 to $60 per year. Privacy Privacy is a major consideration for any VPN, regardless of what kind of VPN you want. The best VPNs all have privacy protections like a kill switch and DNS leak protection, along with a no-logs policy and AES 256-bit encryption (over OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 with WireGuard. Depending on the level of privacy you need, you can get a cheap VPN that offers additional features like Tor over VPN, obfuscation and multihop connections. Speed A VPN will oftenslow down your connection speedsby 50% or more. So you’ll want to look for a VPN that will cut your speeds by as little as possible; ideally less than 20% so that you’ll barely even notice a difference.Fast VPNspeeds are essential for data-heavy activities like streaming, gaming, downloading or video conferencing. A fast VPN will easily handle all of those activities, whereas slow VPN speeds may only be suitable for basic internet browsing. The fastest VPNs we tested include NordVPN, Mullvad, Surfshark and Proton VPN, all of which offered reliable connection speeds. Usability Getting a VPN on the cheap doesn’t necessarily have to mean that you have to sacrifice usability. Many of the more budget-friendly VPN options are miles ahead of their pricier peers in terms of user-friendliness. Look for a VPN that works well across all the devices you want to use. Your VPN should be as easy to use as any other app you may download and should require little to no learning curve. We test cheap VPNsmuch like we do any VPN, but we pay special attention to the cost of the service to determine its overall value. We test each VPN’s features, speeds and usability across platforms. To determine speed loss, we run over 250 internet speed tests with a VPN enabled and disabled, across multiple VPN servers. We also evaluate how well the VPN performs when streaming and unblocking content from different regions worldwide. Additionally, we run DNS leak tests, inspect the VPN's privacy policy and look for trust signals like transparency reports andthird-party audits. Proton VPNwas developed by the Swiss-based company behind the popular secure email service Proton Mail. The VPN has built a reputation for top-notch security and maximum transparency. Proton VPN's apps are fully open-source, and the software is also regularly audited to help affirm the security of the VPN for users without the time or know-how to inspect the code. On top of security features like akill switchand DNS leak protection, Proton VPN offers extras like malware protection, Tor over VPN and a stealth protocol to help hide the fact that you're using a VPN. If you connect to Proton VPN's Secure Core servers, you'll be able to route your traffic through secure data centers located in Switzerland, Sweden or Iceland before exiting through another location. This provides a critical extra layer of security if you're a user with heightened privacy needs. Aside from its robust privacy protections, Proton does well at unblocking content from various streaming providers, including Netflix. Proton VPN is an excellent choice for budget-conscious VPN users looking for afree VPN. Proton VPN offers the only free VPN recommended by CNET because it's secure and doesn't put limits on speed, data or usage time -- which is something the vast majority of free VPNs can't claim. The free tier doesn't include torrenting support or access to its Secure Core servers, but it delivers the same encryption standards and includes the same basic privacy protections like a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a no-logging promise. Free users are allotted one connection at a time and access to servers in five countries (Japan, The Netherlands, United States, Poland and Romania). If you want to purchase a subscription to Proton VPN, it's more affordable than premium VPN providers like ExpressVPN, although not quite as wallet-friendly as rivals including Surfshark and PIA. The monthly plan is on the cheap side at $10 per month, while the annual plan costs $60 for the first year before jumping to $80 annually, and the two-year plan costs $108 for the first 24 months (then $80 annually). Proton's premium plans offer access to 9,300-plus servers peppering 112 countries, and you'll get 10 simultaneous connections. Ultimately, Proton VPN is one of the best cheap VPNs for privacy enthusiasts and entertainment buffs alike. Read our Proton VPN review PrivadoVPNis a wallet-friendly VPN provider that sets you back $11 monthly, $45 for the first year (then $60 annually) or $54 total for the first two years (then $96 total for two years). Aside from its paid premium plans, PrivadoVPN offers a free VPN tier giving you access to 13 different international servers, including spots in the US, UK, Canada, France, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. The zero-cost service lets you pick any server you like, but you're limited to 10GB of monthly usage. With a paid plan, PrivadoVPN offers hundreds of servers in 49 different countries. That's fine for casual users, but well below the thousands of servers in 100-plus countries that competitors like ProtonVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark and ExpressVPN boast. In our testing, Privado was decent for casual users, providing largely user-friendly apps, solid streaming service unblocking and privacy-friendly jurisdiction. However, its small server network, unreliable internet download speeds and lack of third-party audits make it tough to recommend for all but basic privacy. Power users seeking blazing-fast speeds for streaming, international travelers or folks with critical privacy needs (like political activists, asylum-seekers or paranoid torrenters) should look elsewhere. But if you need fundamental privacy for web browsing or streaming on a budget, Privado's free or low-cost plans may fit the bill. Read our PrivadoVPN review. Surfshark is the best cheap VPN on the market. There are lower-cost VPN providers, like Private Internet Access, but it's tough to find the price-to-performance ratio of the wallet-friendly Surfshark. Additionally, PIA is slower than Surfshark, so while you may be able to get a cheaper VPN, Surfshark doesn't compromise on privacy, speed or streaming service unblocking. Proton VPN's no-cost tier is the only free VPN service we recommend. Otherwise, we don’t recommend using a free VPN for various reasons. First, free VPNs are typically slow, lack premium features, offer a small selection of servers and impose usage limits. Worse, there are free VPNs that sell your data to make money and some are even riddled with malware. You’re much better off getting a full, premium VPN experience with a cheap VPN than risking your privacy with a free VPN just to save money. As with many VPN services, the longer you commit, the bigger the savings over time. A VPN may have an expensive monthly rate of around $10 to $14 per month, but it can still be considered a cheap VPN if its annual subscription prices are more budget-friendly. You can get a cheap VPN for anywhere from around $40 to $60 per year. By comparison, many pricier VPNs like ExpressVPN set you back as much as $100 per year. Using a VPN is perfectly legal across most of the globe, so you shouldn’t have to worry about getting in trouble simply for using a VPN. Check your local laws and regulations before purchasing a VPN. If you do anything illegal while using a VPN, it’s still illegal. If you’re in a region where VPN use is restricted, you can connect to an obfuscated server to hide your VPN usage. VPNs can be expensive because of the cost to the VPN provider of maintaining and adding servers as well as the development of new features. Essentially, it costs money to develop and continue honing a quality service, so you as the consumer pay for that. Thankfully, there are plenty of budget-friendly VPNs that don't cut corners on quality. While VPNs have many benefits, like improving your privacy, helping you access geo-protected content such as foreign Netflix libraries and bypassing throttling or censorship, there are some downsides. Notably, all VPNs slow down your internet connection somewhat, although the fastest VPNs only drop your internet download speed by an average of 20% or less. Some apps or websites might not load properly while you're using a VPN, so you could experience issues until you turn off your VPN or enable split tunneling, which routes only select traffic through an encrypted virtual server.",Discover the best cheap VPNs for 2024.

346,Best Website Builder for 2024,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. Building a website once required time and specialized skills, but in 2024, that’s no longer true. You can launch a site without any coding knowledge. Whether you’re a business owner, content creator, or simply looking to boost your online presence, a website is an essential tool. To get started, there are free builders for simple sites and premium offerings for the more complicated varieties. And services likeSquarespace,Wixand Weebly even let you put together anything from a basic landing page to a feature-loaded business website with email marketing and e-commerce. Read more:27 of the Best Tech Gifts Under $100 for 2024 To help make it easier for you to decide, our experts have gone through many options to find the best website builders for your needs, including free plans. We've compiled a list with all the information you'll need to know about these website builders, so you can focus on the building instead of the different features, the marketing and the pricing. We have a few popular picks on our list, but name-brand buildersaren't ideally suitedfor every scenario. For this list, we've considered customization options, marketing and SEO tools, customer support quality and e-commerce features. My hands-on testing starts with a deep analysis of each website builder’s plans and features to assess value and flexibility. From there, I read reviews on sites likeTrustpilotto evaluate the website builder’s trustworthiness and overall reputation. I also review the company’sBetter Business Bureauprofile and consider the number of open complaints. If the website builder has a free version, I create an account to evaluate the quality of the templates, how easy it is to build/edit a website and how flexible the design tools are. I’m also in the process of testing the most popular website builders using ourframework for testing web hosting services. This involves purchasing a plan and evaluating the website builder for ease of use, server performance and customer service. Notes from these reviews are included in relevant list items. I’ve also included notes about server performance and customer service from reviewing traditional web hosting offered by companies like GoDaddy, as these benefits will also be enjoyed by folks using their website builders. Wixis the biggest player in the website builder game, powering over eight million live websites, according toBuilt With. The core Wix software is built to help individuals like freelancers or solo bloggers and small business owners create a website for the first time, whileWix Studiois built for agencies that want more control over their design. Wix is the best website builder for consultants, freelancers and other service-based business owners. You can also use Wix for a personal site or blog, but the cost can be prohibitive if you’re not generating any revenue, especially when you factor in the storage limitations on lower-tier plans. In my hands-on testing, I found Wix’s site editor both flexible and easy to use. Server performance was also excellent, with 100% uptime during our week of testing and the second-best site speed of all the hosts I’ve benchmarked. Customer service -- the place where even our top-ranking hosts usually fail -- was fast and, despite some initial miscommunications, helpful. Wix offers industry-standard security features. It protects all websites on its platform with secure socket layer --SSL-- certification to encrypt your data. There’s also an advanced firewall with distributed denial of service --DDoS-- protection to prevent malware or malicious traffic from harming your site. You can also enable two-factor authentication to further protect your site. Wix provides 24/7 security monitoring to find and eliminate vulnerabilities. Wix has a free plan, but the bandwidth and data restrictions mean it’s mostly useful for testing the software before purchasing. The most affordable paid plan starts at $17 a month (billed annually) and includes enough storage for at least 20 pages, unlimited bandwidth and basic marketing tools. E-commerce features are available starting on the Core plan, which costs $29 a month, billed annually. Core also includes enough storage for at least 500 pages, various tools for service-based businesses (like appointment booking and course creation software) and a slightly more advanced marketing suite. Squarespace is another big player in the website builder space, powering overfivemillion websites. Squarespace aims to help professionals and small business owners new to website creation build their first online home. Squarespaceis an excellent choice if you’re building a professional portfolio and you want a slick, elegant design you don’t have to spend much time on. What stood out in my hands-on Squarespace testing is how easy it is to create a beautiful site. The templates are some of the best I’ve seen, with great visual balance, color schemes and font selections. The AI builder is uniquely collaborative, letting you choose key aspects of your site -- like brand personality and fonts -- to help it create a website that matches your vision. No matter which option you choose, you’ll have an attractive site in minutes, with minimal need to alter design settings. Squarespace also had excellent uptime and decent site speed. Furthermore, all Squarespace sites are secured with SSL certification, an advanced firewall with DDoS protection, two-factor authentication and 24/7 security monitoring. However, there’s a caveat: I experienced lackluster customer service when testing Squarespace. Thankfully, many users won’t need customer service often. In over 10 years of running websites, I’ve contacted customer service five or six times. This means customer service probably won’t impact your Squarespace experiences much, if at all. Squarespace starts at $16 a month (billed annually) for full access to the website builder, including essential marketing tools. You’ll also get e-commerce functionality, but Squarespace will collect some hefty transaction fees: 2% for online store transactions and 7% for digital content and memberships. These are in addition to the roughly 3% charged by most payment processors, so you’ll actually be losing 5% total on online store transactions and 10% on membership fees. You can skip the online store transaction fees by opting for the Squarespace Core plan priced at $23 a month (billed annually). However, Squarespace will still collect 5% transaction fees on digital content and memberships. You’ll have to pay $99 a month (billed annually) for the Advanced plan if you don’t want Squarespace taking a chunk out of your profits (payment processor fees will still apply). Shopify is probably the most well-known e-commerce website builder, powering nearlyfivemillion online stores. Shopify is the best website builder for building an e-commerce store. It’s also a great choice if you hope to sell at pop-up markets or open a permanent physical store in the future. Shopify offers a robust store builder with a wide variety of highly customizable templates, tools for creating detailed product pages and a checkout system compatible with different payment processing tools. You’ll also get several marketing tools, including abandoned cart recovery, email marketing software and automated marketing workflows. Some of Shopify’s biggest benefits are specifically for selling physical products, like the significant (up to 77%) shipping discounts for USPS, DHL and UPS. You can also use the Shopify Point of Sale system to sell products at in-person events or even run checkout at a permanent physical location. If you’re selling internationally, Shopify makes creating a multilingual web store easy. All Shopify websites are secured with SSL certification, an advanced firewall featuring DDoS prevention, two-factor authentication and 24/7 security monitoring. Unfortunately, there are over 2,000negative reviews of Shopify on Trustpilot. Most cite issues with slow customer service, while others cite more serious problems like people being locked out of their stores without explanation or failing to receive payments. These reviews are concerning -- and good to know about -- but 2,000 reviews is a drop in the bucket when compared to the 4.9 million stores operating on Shopify, so you probably don’t need to be concerned. Shopify’s Basic plan costs $29 a month (billed annually) for all of the core website builder and email marketing features. This plan also includes unlimited storage and bandwidth, inventory management for up to 10 locations and Shopify POS Lite for selling at physical events. However, a domain is not included in this price, even in the first year. You’ll need to add $20 to $30 (depending on your domain extension) for domain registration to your annual budget. Duda is a smaller player compared witharound 990,000 live websites, and it focuses on a specific market segment: designers and design agencies. Duda’s advanced customization options make it a great choice if you’re a designer showcasing your skills. Design agencies can also get a lot out of Duda’s collaboration tools. Duda's builder boasts several features that set it apart, including detailed data analytics (e.g., advanced metrics like form submissions, time on page and bounce rate) and user personalization so you can easily display specific messages or offers to visitors based on the time of day, their location or their browsing history. All Duda sites are secured with SSL certification, an advanced firewall with automated DDoS prevention and customizable access controls. Duda servers are continuously monitored through automated malware scanning and updated with frequent security patches to eliminate vulnerabilities as they arise. Duda’s Basic plan costs $19 a month (billed annually). Basic includes unlimited storage and bandwidth, a free domain for the first year, 500 AI credits and tools for receiving client feedback while your site is in progress. However, you’ll only get customer support via email. Live chat and phone support are only accessible at the Agency plan ($52 a month, billed annually) and the White Label plan ($149 a month, billed annually). E-commerce functionality must be purchased through a separate subscription, starting at $7 a month (billed annually) for up to 100 products. This brings the total cost up to $26 a month if you’re on the Basic plan. GoDaddyis one of the biggest companies in the web hosting business, powering15.6% of all websites. GoDaddy offers both traditional web hosting and a website builder aimed at complete beginners. GoDaddy is the best website builder for beginners looking to create a simple site. While our hands-on testing focused on traditional shared hosting, the main benefits -- great server performance and good customer service -- are things you’ll also experience using the website builder. I also enjoyed how easy it was to use the GoDaddy website builder. The design tools, SEO tools and marketing tools are clearly laid out so you can perform essential website management tasks in minutes, even without previous experience. This is achieved in part through limiting its functionality -- the GoDaddy website builder doesn’t offer the same level of customization as others on this list. But it’s more than enough for creating a personal site or a portfolio meant to be the digital equivalent of a business card. GoDaddy’s Basic website builder plan starts at $10 a month (billed annually) and increases to $17 a month on renewal. This plan lets you create up to 50 pages and accommodate 10,000 monthly visitors on your site. However, you won’t get a custom domain. Domain registration costs an additional $20 to $30 per year. You’ll also need to pay $107.78 per year for the Web Security add-on if you want firewall protection, DDoS prevention and malware scanning/cleanup. E-commerce functionality is limited to the Commerce plan priced at $21 a month (billed annually) for the first year and $35 a month on renewal. Commerce lets you create a robust online store with unlimited products, sell on popular social media marketplaces and send 100,000 marketing emails per month. You’ll also get inventory management and sales tax calculation tools. However, you’ll still need to pay extra for a custom domain and security features like firewall protection. If you’re building a professional portfolio, you’ll probably want the elegant design and moderate flexibility of Squarespace. If you’re building a coaching business -- or any other type of service-based business -- you might consider Wix for its appointment booking tools. If you’re creating an e-commerce store, you’ll probably want Shopify. If you’re building a personal or hobby site, you might be okay with GoDaddy’s simplistic interface and minimal options. Every website builder lets you create a website without code. Beyond that, there are many differences between website builder interfaces. Some are more intuitive, making it easy to move from one area of site design to the next. Others use complicated processes that can be difficult to grasp if you’re not technically inclined. A steeper learning curve means a longer site building process. Wix offers users a pretty comprehensive suite of website editing tools. Some website builders have limited options for fonts and color schemes, while others limit your ability to move content blocks. This can be great if you’re creating a personal site or a professional portfolio and you don’t want to spend a lot of time making small design decisions. If you want to create something unique, you’ll want to choose a website builder with more flexibility and spend more time fiddling with every individual setting. While most website builders offer unlimited storage, some companies like Wix have strict storage limits, making it important to consider how many pages -- and the types of pages -- you’ll be creating. A good rule of thumb is that you’ll need 1GB of storage for 10 large pages (like product pages with several high-resolution images) or 100 small pages (like blog posts with 1-2 images). Shopify is primarily focused on giving users a platform for online sales. Do you plan to sell products on your site? If so, will selling products be just one part of your site (like a blog with a merch store) or will it be the focus of your site? If it’s the former, most website builders will work for you. If it’s the latter, you may want to choose a specialized website builder for e-commerce like Shopify. You’ll need to read the plans closely if you’re choosing a website builder that isn’t specially designed for e-commerce. Some, like Wix, restrict e-commerce features to higher-tier plans. Others, like Squarespace, offer e-commerce on all plans but charge steep transaction fees on lower-tier plans. Most website builders offer AI site generation, which builds a site for you in a couple of minutes based on your site title, description, and purpose. However, the quality of these tools varies. Some, like the Wix AI tool, generate sites that look like they came right out of 2008 (unless you enjoyed the MySpace era, that’s not a good thing). Others, like Squarespace, build beautiful websites. If you want to use AI site generation, read in-depth reviews or watch YouTube tutorials to see how each website builder’s AI tools work. Before you build your website with AI, though, I recommend reading up on the ethical and legal concerns surrounding AI. Many Generative AI tools are trained by scraping content from the web, often without consent from or compensation for the original creators. Some companies are embroiled in copyright lawsuits because of this, including alawsuit against Stable Diffusion. As of writing this article, it’s also impossible to copyright AI-generated work in the US. Finally, I recommend avoiding AI if you’re concerned about climate change, as AI uses an enormousamount of powerandwater. Square payment solutions are supported by many website builders. Some website builders, like Wix, only offer advanced features like automated sales tax calculation on a limited number of transactions per month. This can make life complicated if you’re selling a lot of products. You’ll also want to consider transaction fees. Most website builders don’t charge anything beyond the standard payment processor fees (usually around 3%), but some, like Squarespace, charge additional transaction fees. These fees typically take an additional 2 to 7% out of your profits, so you’ll lose a total of 5 to 10% on every sale -- a significant loss if you’re selling hundreds or thousands of products. You can pass these costs on to the customer by raising your prices, but it may be more worthwhile to choose a website builder or plan without these fees. You should have 24/7 access to customer service through your preferred method of communication, like email or live chat. Some companies offer phone service as well. Most website builders are proprietary, meaning you’ll be stuck with the hosting company that created them. Some don’t even let you download your files for transferring to another host. Others, like Duda, let you download your site and transfer it to another host. However, making sure your site looks good after you’ve transferred it can be a time-consuming process. If you think you might want to switch hosts at some point, choose a company that won’t force you to start over from scratch when you make the transition. Most website builders use one of two pricing models: traditional web hosting pricing and simplified website builder hosting. Traditional web hosting pricingcomes with a significant introductory discount if you sign up for one or more years. You’ll have to pay up front for those years, but you’ll save a lot of money over the lifetime of your contract. However, your payment will increase significantly (often by $10 or more per month) when the contract renews. Simplified website builder hostingcharges the same amount yearly, with no introductory discounts or renewal price hikes. This makes it easy to calculate long-term costs, but you’ll often pay $15 or more per month from the get-go. You’ll also need to consider additional expenses. For example, many website builders include your domain free for the first year, then charge $20 to $30 for domain renewal every subsequent year. You may also need to buy extensions for things like advanced marketing tools. BigCommerceis built for medium- to large-scale online stores that can cash in on the lack of added transaction fees and unlimited product variants. The editor has a lot of features and flexibility when you're getting set up. Those features and tools -- like product variants and tax rates -- will probably come in handy as you grow or if you're already at scale. Unfortunately, BigCommerce has over200 one-star reviews on Trustpilot. While this is a smaller number of negative reviews than Shopify or Squarespace, it’s more statistically significant when considering that BigCommerce only powers43,000 active websites. BigCommerce plansstart at $29 a month for unlimited storage, bandwidth and product creation. You’ll also get inventory management tools for up to four locations. When most people talk about WordPress, they're usually referring to the free, open-source software available through WordPress.org. This software is very powerful, but you’ll need to perform various tasks like updating the software and installing plugins for things like SEO. WordPress.comis a hosting company that uses a modified version of the WordPress.org software as a website builder. The Gutenberg editor at its core (and the core of WordPress.org tech) uses content blocks with drag-and-drop functionality to make editing individual pages easy, while the Customizer lets you edit the overall appearance of your site. Moreover, WordPress.com updates and secures this software, so you don’t have to worry about it. Unfortunately, there are some issues with WordPress.com. You can’t access most of the themes that make the WordPress.org software so flexible, and you can’t install any plugins on lower-tier plans. E-commerce plans are also extremely expensive, starting at $45 a month, and there are manyTrustpilot reviewssuggesting that you won’t get what you’re paying for. Still, WordPress.com may be worth considering for its good blogging tools, decent user interface and generousfree hostingplan. You can also getpaid WordPress.com plansstarting at $4 for 6GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth. Wix is the most popular website builder, powering overeight million websites. The easiest website builder is the GoDaddy website builder. However, its design tools are limited, so you shouldn’t use the GoDaddy website builder if you want to create a truly unique site. Using a website builder is better for most people, as it doesn’t require learning advanced code or spending thousands of dollars to hire someone to build a site for you. However, most website builders limit your design options to some extent. They can also be costly in the long run. If you’re looking for a good balance between customizability and affordability, I recommend building a site with WordPress. WordPress is a content management system that lets you create, organize and maintain a website without code. It’s more complicated than most website builders -- you’ll need to upgrade it and add plugins yourself -- but you can getWordPress hostingthat helps with these aspects of site maintenance starting at just $3 to $5 a month. Wix is easier to use than WordPress. You don’t have to update any software or add plugins/extensions for basic functions like SEO. This makes Wix better than WordPress for many users. However, many others prefer WordPress because the thousands of themes and plugins let you do almost anything with it -- and many of them are free. WordPress also offers more advanced blogging tools, making it a better choice for writers. According to our hands-on testing, Wix is better than Squarespace in three key areas: ease of use, server performance and customer service.

347,CNET's 2024 Game of the Year Awards,"It's the most wonderful time of the year! Everyone is at home, warm and cozy, surrounded by loved ones and cold climates, and there's a mountain of great video games waiting to be played. Despite rampant layoffs and harsh working conditions for many developers and game industry professionals, there was still a ton of great entertainment being released this year. The staff here at CNET spent our yeartraveling the globepreviewingnew softwareandhardware. We've now come together to write down what stood out the most to us and how we spent our free time. Here is a top 10 list of games, unranked, except for a clear, overall Game of the Year winner. We've also included a handful of honorable mentions that we felt deserved recognition but didn't quite make our main list. We'll begin with those… Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Sean Booker, Video Producer I didn't know what to expect when I first previewed The Great Circleback in August. After so many years of Uncharted games riffing on the Indiana Jones movies, it made sense that MachineGames would follow a similar format – I couldn't have been more wrong. Instead, we got a first-person adventure game that veers closer to an immersive sim than high-action blockbuster.And I can't stop playing it. I'm completing every objective, finding every relic and punching so, so many Nazis. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is immensely fun, from the funny and clever writing to the awesome performance from Troy Baker. Each new zone I enter is another extremely enjoyable sandbox to explore. I love sneaking my way around these intricately designed areas, finding hidden tombs, wearing disguises to get past guards, and photographing my journey to unlock more adventure points. And I say all this as a very passive fan of the movies. Despite thishigh bar of quality, The Great Circle released very late in the year –   in fact, its release date was the same day as our Game of the Year deliberations. At that time, only myself and a freelancer had spent any time with the game and not enough of the staff had any experience with the title. Despite this, I felt strongly enough that Indiana Jones deserved some recognition and slotted it into our honorable mentions. Marvel Rivals - Adam Benjamin, Managing Editor Last night I came home from a movie and played Marvel Rivals. After I finish work today, I'm going to play Marvel Rivals. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give is that this game is the first thing that has managed to pull me away from Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game hasn't even been out for a month, so hero balance and matchmaking aren't exactly polished, but playing Rivals is still usually more fun than not playing Rivals. Much of that is due to the iconic heroes generally feeling like faithful and fun representations of their comic book counterparts, but the slick hero design and snappy gameplay also help. I'm particularly impressed by the game's ability to make its tank and support heroes (""vanguards"" and ""strategists"" in the game's terminology) so much fun to play. Whether I'm charging forward as Cap or Thor, shielding off damage as Doctor Strange, outdueling the Punisher as Mantis or gobbling up half the enemy team as Jeff the Land Shark, I find myself enjoying every role. Marvel Rivals missed our main list due to its very recent release and the dependency live-service games have on content roadmaps. The true test for Rivals will come next year: Can the game keep up with balancing demands, matchmaking needs and players' thirst for new heroes? But its early days have been impressive and noteworthy, and I'm hoping the developers can keep that momentum going for years to come. Hades 2 - Lori Grunin, Senior Editor It's still in early access, but Hades 2 was my big addiction of 2024 –   until that dopamine-drip Balatro knocked it out of my hands when I finally picked it up in October. Even in its unfinished state, with no achievements, no final boss or endgame narrative, no idea why it asks you to do some of the things it does, occasionally frustrating lag, no clue when it will officially launch and so on, I've played over 130 hours. (So sue me: I find taking a run up to Olympus before going to sleep calming.)  But those caveats are also my reasons for not nominating it for GOTY 2024. There's a lot of overlap between Hades 2 and the first game, with similar mechanics, characters and battles. For instance, battling the undead within buildings in the dead city of Ephyra feels identical to Zagreus battling through the Temple of Styx. But I find Hades 2 far more interesting –   if probably easier –   to play. It introduces spellcrafting, more diverse resource gathering, deckbuilding and animal allies. Plus, instead of a single region to more-or-less linearly fight your way through, in Hades 2 you have to fight your way down through the underworld as well as up to the top of Olympus. That makes a huge difference, because you can choose which direction to head at the start of a run, and makes it feel less like you're rehashing the same routes ad infinitum. And while Chronos occasionally tosses you into Asphodel, one of the regions that hasn't changed from the first game, you're not there frequently or for long enough to dread it. Because I HATE ASPHODEL. The region requires trying to kill while not getting killed, constantly moving, and simultaneously playing The Floor Is Lava. Astro Bot - Faith Chihil, Social Producer When Game of the Year conversations started in the CNET bullpen, Astro Bot was thegroup's first refrain, breathlessly repeated in hallowed tones.The Game Awards clearly agreed, crowning it Game of the Year on Thursday. I was apprehensive at first. ""The robot from the PSVR tutorial?"" I thought. A similarly skeptical friend said his main critique was that it seemed like an overblown Sony ad: ""Using the controller and console as visuals in the game just seems so uninspired."" But thirty hours in, I'd argue the Sony-ness is intrinsic to what makes the game so charming. Astro Bot barrels wholeheartedly into the annals of Playstation's history, making it a joy to discover each bot and match the reference, whether it's a musical cue, a custom skin or a few words of flavor text. I found myself wanting to go back and play games just so I could better understand the references. Even the soundtrack has the nostalgic vibes of another classic PlayStation ""collect little guys"" game, Katamari Damacy, right down to itsself-referential theme song. Astro Bot may have started arguably as Sony's answer to Microsoft's Clippy, but unlike the retired paperclip, his reign has no end in sight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - Sarah Drolet, Writer I Final Fantasy VII Rebirth isn't just my personal game of the year –   it's also one of my new favorite games of all time. I'll admit, I was a little nervous to see how the open world segments of Rebirth would play out, especially considering the entirety of Final Fantasy VII Remake had us confined within the walls of Midgar. But this game blew me away. From the gorgeous visuals, incredible orchestral renditions of the music from the original game, upgraded combat system and the overwhelming amount of content, this game had me hooked (for nearly 90 hours). Playing through Rebirthalmost feels like you're on a really long road trip with a group of friends. It does a great job capturing the sometimes wild, wacky humor of the original, while still maintaining the drama and suspense of the more serious moments in the narrative. And the spotlight isn't just on Cloud this time around. Each party member gets their own moments to shine throughout the game, with their own sidequests and story beats during the main questline. Tifa and Aerith in particular are at their best in Rebirth, and I loved seeing their friendship blossom throughout the course of the game. In terms of storytelling, Rebirth is more faithful to the original narrative than Remake but there are still some unexpected twists and turns to be found, and for the most part, I'm enjoying the new direction that Square Enix decided to take the story. If you've never played the original Final Fantasy VII, there's never been a better time to get into the franchise. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Bridget Carey, Editor at Large Never have I had such a good time defeating evil by stacking old beds and summoning sharks. Echoes of Wisdom isn't your typical Zelda game, and yet it inspires nostalgia for something in the past –   the ultimate echo of everything loved about the Zelda franchise, while feeling completely fresh. For the first time, our main playable hero is not the swordsman Link, but Princess Zelda herself. Now she is saving Link – and yes, she can swing a sword – but she's mostly using a new ability in her battles: she can make copies of other elements and creatures in the world to do her bidding. Like a game programmer gone wild, you can spawn anything on a whim. It's an incredibly creative approach to solving problems, which I've grown to love doing as a team with my kids on the couch, with everyone yelling out ways to solve dungeons when we're stuck. What makes a great well-rounded game is something with a fun story and satisfying challenge, but not too hard for kids to join in. The series is 38 years old and continues to surprise and delight.Echoes of Wisdom is a great starter to the franchisewith its classic overhead view and tilt-shifted focus (similar in visuals to the2019 remake of Link's Awakening). But it also forces fans to think completely differently in how they get through dungeons and bosses. No two people will play it the same way. (Unless you also make beds appear everywhere. Then maybe we do play alike.) Dragon Age: The Veilguard - David Katzmaier, Senior Director of Content Your party about to fight a dragon. It's been 15 years since the first time I played Dragon Age – the seminal Origins in 2009, which I loved – and a decade since I conquered the excellent Inquisition. Veilguard, despite the lame name, was worth the wait. It has everything I want in a sprawling fantasy RPG: rich character creation builds, versatile skill trees, world-spanning lore, scads of factions and regions, superb voice acting across multiple interesting (and romanceable) companions and consequential choices that actually affect the plot. Onewelcome additionis the game's meta-feedback about important decisions, from ""Emmrich approves"" to ""Taash explored their identity with Neve and Harding's support."" I'm also here for the dumb jokes. In one mini-quest I helped a baby griffin and an animated skeleton butler troll the uptight Gray Warden. My dialogue choice was ""squaaak!"" Veilguard's advantage over its predecessors, aside from graphics and quality-of-life improvements, is the combat. It reminds me of God of War, albeit more forgiving, and it beats any blend of action/strategy-lite I've played. Most fights I stick to real time, spamming last-second dodge-rolls and eyeing my cooldowns to program a lethal combo. But some challenge me enough to mash the shoulder pause button, where I can mix abilities, direct allies and select bosses or mobs at leisure, or just catch my breath. Of course I compare Veilguard to last year's incredibleBaldur's Gate 3and of course it falls short. BG3 is my favorite game ever, full stop, and I've been gaming since my local Minute Market gotTron. But Veilguard is still superb. Itmanages to evoke other all-timersfrom developer BioWare, like Mass Effect 2 and Star Wars: KOTOR, while upping the adrenaline and staying true to the storied past of Thedas, the setting for the series. 30 hours in and I'm still stoked to progress with my glass cannon joke-slinging dude elf mage. And I'm already planning my second playthrough as a melee tough-talkin' girl dwarf rogue. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree - David Lumb, Writer II As I stepped into The Lands Beyond, I wondered what would make it worth $40 for a DLC. Galloping through fields of wheat spliced with phantom gravestones, I found an ethereal realm of grotesque monsters and ancient lore, a land of sorrow and history, all wrapped in the minimalist storytelling and tough challenge I'd come to expect from Elden Ring studio FromSoftware. Despite being an expansion,Shadow of the Erdtreeis nearly an entire game in itself, delivering a massive world to explore and a litany of additions that can be brought back to enjoy in the original Elden Ring. Who doesn't want more of 2022's Game of the Year? Granted, it takes some doing to access Shadow of the Erdtree, as playersneed to progress a ways into the base gamebefore venturing in. The Tarnished player character follows demigod Miquella into a realm that's the shadowy inverse of The Lands Between, encountering ten new major bosses, plenty of new enemies, over100 additional weaponsand even more combat skills. From castles to molten tunnels to ruins to yet another of the poison swamps that creator Hidetaka Miyazaki keeps putting in FromSoftware's games, Shadow of the Erdtree has so much more to offer Elden Ring players that it's easily worth the price of entry. And there's plenty in the expansion to offer fans who love picking apart the lore. ""There is the sort of a culture or a society of the Erdtree, but in addition, there are hints and easter eggs of ruins that predates a lot of that society and culture that you see,""Miyazaki told CNETat Summer Game Fest in June. Shadow of the Erdtree is more of what players want – that is, more of everything the original Elden Ring delivered – and serves as a satisfying bridge until the co-op survival spinoff,Elden Ring Nightreign, arrives in 2025. Metaphor ReFantazio - Imad Khan, Senior Writer The battle menu's design style is in line with Persona's stylish look. As much as I roll my eyes at thestory and settingof Metaphor ReFantazio, I can't help but go back to its addictive RPG gameplay loop. It's the best gameplay to come out of Atlus, yet. Thesystems are so well refinedthat you won't find yourself trying to needlessly level up to handle the boss ahead of you. There's balance and attention given to how players will experience this game. And limiting general RPG annoyances seemed to be high on the priority list. For example, instead of having to enter random battles with weak, instant-kill enemies, you can instead just wack them as soon as you see them and get the necessary experience points. That said, the narrative of Metaphor ReFantazio is only middle school deep. Its commentaries on race, religion and caste seem to exist because they can. There isn't much depth to the broader societal discrimination other than that it's just there. Having anxiety-inducing enemy attacks doesn't advance any understanding or give deeper insight on what the emotion is and what it does to us and the people around us. Despite Metaphor's narrative inadequacies, the gameplay is worth enduring the young adult melodrama. UFO 50 - Scott Stein, Principal Writer There are games of the year, and then there are games that are 50 games. UFO 50 arrives like a mystery box: a strange invitation to a game compilation for a console that never existed. UFOSoft, and its developers, are a marvelous fiction made-real in a bundle of classics that are entirely new indie entities. As a lover of retro games, I've found myself treasuring collections like Atari 50, or those old NES, SNES and Genesis mini-consoles with the games baked in. UFO 50 delivers that nostalgic surprise but with games no one's ever played…and the discovery of the rules, the secrets, the control schemes, those are all part of the journey. I couldname five gamesin UFO 50 that were among my favorite games of the year. With 50 to choose from, the options are daunting. I started browsing, game-surfing, bouncing around. Some of the games are even multiplayer, if you have a spare controller. UFO 50 is Steam-only for now, though putting this thing on a Nintendo Switch feels like the most necessary move ever. I've been playing on a Steam Deck, and UFO 50 has made me love Steam Deck gaming more than anything ever has. I don't expect you'll love all the UFO 50 games, or even figure them all out. They can be extremely hard, obscure, and sometimes intentionally ugly. But I love all of it, and I feel wooed by this parallel universe game compilation. I've started following along to podcasts breaking down each game, and reading Reddit threads on game rankings, and wondering what the mysterious ""Terminal"" in the game does with codes I still haven't found. Let go, fall down the UFO 50 rabbit hole, and be a kid again in a past you never lived in. I'm finding myself reconnecting with that strange joy I had with games when I owned an Atari 2600 and wondered what wonders each odd cartridge would bring. Helldivers 2 - Tyler Graham, Associate Writer In Helldivers 2, you can launch into matches solo, but harder difficulties benefit from backup of 1-3 additional squadmates. Listen, this isn't my first rodeo when it comes to spreading managed democracy across the universe. As a Helldivers veteran, I've done my fair share of top-down running, gunning, teamkilling and stratagem shotcalling throughout multiple galactic campaigns. It turns out that all you need to do to make one of the most entertaining co-op games of all time is take that winning formula and slot it into a third-person shooter. Now, hundreds of thousands of helldivers are laying down their lives for Super Earth every day, and this virtual war feelsmore alive than ever before. That's what really makes Helldivers 2 stand out as something special. Emergent stories are constantly cropping up everywhere –   in individual missions and in the meta-narrative. Often, I find myself running from a pack of bots whose lasers have minced my teammates, or steering a hellpod onto a bile titan, becoming a one-man precision strike to save my friends. Sometimes, I call an artillery strike down on someone that has strayed too far behind enemy lines, because we all need to make sacrifices for liberty. These little heroic deeds always feel important, especially since everyone is fighting a war on three fronts to push back enemy forces, unlocking new toys to play with and protecting the civilians back home. Helldivers 2 is a game that invites players to be a part of something larger than themselves, not unlike Planetside 2 or Foxhole. The scope of the conflict is impressive and the overarching storyline of shifting fronts directing players to save worlds makes playing feel like a galaxy-wide effort. Defending Super Earth is fun –   it's exhilarating to beat back hundreds of enemies and it can be absolutely hilarious to watch things fall apart in real time. No other game telling a community-driven story has achieved the success of Helldivers 2, and that makes it one of the most important games of 2024. Animal Well - Zach McAuliffe, Writer II What pulled me into Animal Well wasn't its gameplay, but the neon-drenched pixel graphics. Each section of the map is both lively and harsh as water falls from the top of your screen to a pool below one second and a dog chases you down a hole the next. Creatures shy away from you and hide in their burrows and ghosts relentlessly pursue you. After I was finished taking in the entrancing surroundings, I lost myself in figuring out how to solve the puzzles. But solving one puzzle usually requires solving one or two others first. While this might feel tedious in other games, it feels rewarding in Animal Well because no two puzzles are alike. Each time you solve one, you have a brief moment of satisfaction before you have to move on and tackle the next. Beyond that, the game mechanics,hidden paths and items are interesting, and it all feels that much more impressive in a game with little to no dialogue or direction. I'll replay Animal Well for years to come, and I relish the thought of finding new secrets and ways to solve the puzzles on every playthrough. Balatro - David Lumb, Writer II When Balatro launched in February, gamers found a new addiction: though the poker-themed deckbuilder didn't have a story, players were sucked into their own narratives racking up high scores playing straights, flushes and other hands to defeat the next ante. Getting new playstyle-altering Jokers and boosting your deck with Tarot cards keeps each run fresh, making losses easier to stomach. You'll justboot up a new runand… there goes another hour.Balatro is life. It's tough to pinpoint the specific alchemy that makes Balatro so fun. Playing familiar poker hands seems easy enough, but there's a gleeful mystery to whether your combination of Jokers and upgrades will rack up just enough chips to meet the round's ante score threshold (don't fall to temptation and use a calculator!). Like any good roguelike, even losing a run will probably lead to unlocking new decks, Jokers and other bonuses you might discover next time you play. And hey – who doesn't love a game that bakes in ""cheating"" with novel Jokers and rare cards? There's a bit of a Cinderella story behind Balatro, as enigmatic developer and artist LocalThunk made the game on his own to see it skyrocket to the top of the charts and even bag a handful of GOTYs at The Game Awards. It's easy to play and makes gamers feel clever as it constantly reveals new ways to win. Now thatit's on phones, there's no reason not to pick Balatro up. Surrender your commutes and working hours.

348,iOS 18.2: Here's How to Change or Undo Your iPhone's Mail Categories,"Apple releasediOS 18.2on Dec. 11, more than a month after the tech giant releasediOS 18.1. The latest update brings a handful of Apple Intelligence features, likeGenmojiandImage Playground, to people with theiPhone 15 Pro and Pro Maxor a device from theiPhone 16 lineup. The update also introduces Mail Categories to every iPhone. ""Mail Categorization sorts your messages to help you prioritize the most important messages,"" Apple wrote in iOS 18.2's release notes. If you don't like how Categories work in Mail, no worries -- you can revert your app to look the way it did before the update. Read more:Everything You Need to Know About iOS 18 Here's what you need to know about Mail Categories and how to remove the categories so your app looks like it did before the update. Categories in Mail are similar to categories you would find in Gmail. The app filters your emails into one of four categories: Primary, Transactions, Updates and Promotions. Emails with receipts, as well as order and delivery information fill the Transactions category, and news, social and other subscription emails go to Updates. Emails with special offers and deals go to Promotions, as you might imagine. The Primary category is a little more difficult to pin down. Apple writes in the app that Primary is for ""Messages that matter most."" I've used the redesigned app since it launched in beta, and in that time my Primary category was filled with emails from my wife, customer service and even refund information. It's a little bit of a catch-all category. You can for most messages but not all. Here's how. 1.Tap Mail.2.Tap either Transactions, Updates or Promotions tabs across the top of Mail -- but not Primary -- and tap a message.3.Tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner.4.TapCategorization. Then you can manually categorize messages from a given sender to another category. Unfortunately, all messages from a sender will go to the new category, which could be irksome. Once, I ordered tickets for a show at a local theater, and the email was filtered to Promotions. I moved the email with those tickets to Primary, but now all emails from this theater -- including deals and sales -- go to my Primary category. Not being able to change that categorization back is annoying. It's important to note that you can recategorize an email from Promotions to Deals and then back to Promotions without issue. The only emails that can't be recategorized are those in Primary. If you don't like Mail Categories, you can remove them so Mail looks like it did before the update. Here's how. 1.Tap Mail.2.Tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner of the app.3.TapList View. Now your emails will populate in Mail from top to bottom as they arrive in your inbox.

351,"CyberGhost VPN Review 2024: Great for Streaming, but Beware of Buggy Apps and Iffy Data Practices","We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. CyberGhost is a decent virtual private network for folks who like towatch international streaming contentfrom around the world. The veteran Romainia-based VPN provider is also a good choice for anyone who needs servers in many unique international locations -- whether you’re living in ortravelingto a region that isn’t typically included in VPN server location lists. Ithoroughly testedCyberGhost’s VPN over the course of several weeks in June and again in December 2024. While getting hands-on, I evaluated the performance of its apps on various devices, ran more than 250 speed tests, assessed its overall value and examined what it does to protect user privacy. I constantly communicated with CyberGhost representatives throughout the process via email and videoconferencing. Overall, I found that CyberGhost is excellent for streaming and has the potential to be a good VPN for casual users. But the apps were far too buggy for my liking, and the company seems to engage in a few questionable practices that don’t necessarily serve the interest of user privacy. Though there are some things to like about CyberGhost, it’s not a VPN that I would recommend forprivacy-conscious users, and it ultimately falls short of cracking CNET’s list of thebest VPNsat this time. Here's what you need to know about CyberGhost VPN. Considering thatmany VPNs can cut your internet speeds by 50% or more, the 30% average speed loss I registered with CyberGhost is comparatively speedy. However, given thatNordVPN(the fastest VPN in our latest tests) registered a mere 11% speed loss, CyberGhost’s 30% speed loss is rather sluggish. In addition to NordVPN, other top VPNs have demonstrated better speed results than CyberGhost, including Mullvad’s 13.5% speed loss, Surfshark’s 17%, Proton VPN’s 21% and ExpressVPN’s 25%. I tested CyberGhost’s speeds onWindowsusing WireGuard and OpenVPN. OnMacOS, I used  WireGuard and IKEv2 because OpenVPN is not available for CyberGhost’s MacOS client. As expected, I measured the fastest speeds on MacOS through WireGuard, where I calculated an impressive 13.4% speed loss. However, each of the other OS/protocolcombinations hovered around 32% to 38% speed loss. MacOS WireGuard speeds were snappy, humming along at above 340Mbps to CyberGhost servers in NY, the UK and Europe on my 370Mbps internet connection. However, speeds were a bit shaky to Singapore, where they fluctuated between 85Mbps and 315 Mbps -- which is to be expected -- but I’ve seen much better speeds to distant locations from other providers, including Mullvad, which consistently achieved plus-300Mbps speeds to both Singapore and Australia. When testing speeds through the IKEv2 protocol on Mac, speeds to Singapore were horrendous at less than 1Mbps, which was the main contributor to the mediocre 38.6% speed loss through IKEv2. Windows speeds were uneven, dipping to around 100Mbps and jumping to more than 350Mbps from one test to another in several locations on both OpenVPN and WireGuard. That said, I found CyberGhost’s speeds to be mostly capable and fast enough for almost anything you’d want to do online, even data-heavy activities like streaming, gaming or torrenting. Speeds will generally be faster to VPN servers closer to your physical location because the data you’re sending and receiving travels a shorter distance than when you’re connecting to a VPN server halfway across the world. In my testing, that mostly held true for CyberGhost, with speeds being consistently fast to servers relatively near my testing location in Ohio. CyberGhost delivered impressive speeds to New York and even across the ocean to the UK and Europe. My speed readings tapered off more significantly when I connected to distant servers in Singapore and Australia. I’m impressed with CyberGhost’s massive network of servers that cover nearly every corner of the globe. This can ensure more people around the world get access to fast and stable VPN connections through CyberGhost. It can also deliverfast speedswherever you may be traveling. In addition to servers in the usual locations like the US, UK, Australia and Japan, CyberGhost boasts the most diverse set of server locations I’ve seen in a VPN. A few of the uncommon locations you won’t find with most VPNs but that CyberGhost offers include Andorra, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Kenya, Laos, Liechtenstein, Macao, Malaysia, Moldova, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Qatar and Sri Lanka. This makes CyberGhost a solid choice for people living in or around these regions or anyone traveling to these locations. Key takeaway:CyberGhost’s speeds are average but not exceptional. However, there’s a lot to like about its humungous offering of servers, especially in such a unique set of locales. CyberGhost sits right in the middle of its two sister VPNsExpressVPNandPIA(parent company Kape Technologies PLC owns all three VPNs) when it comes to price. But in terms of overall value, CyberGhost is far behind. CyberGhost’s monthly subscription plan costs $13 per month, which is on par with others like ExpressVPN andNordVPNbut more expensive than more budget-friendly options likeProton VPN($11), PIA ($12) andMullvad($5). If you want a longer-term subscription, CyberGhost offers two options: A biannual plan at $42 every six months or a two-year plan that costs $57 for the first 28 months, then renews annually at $57. If you go with the biannual plan, you’ll pay more for half a year with CyberGhost than for a full year for PIA. And if you renew your biannual subscription with CyberGhost, you’ll pay more for one year of CyberGhost than you would for three years of PIA. If you choose the two-year plan, the $57 you’ll pay annually after the initial 28-month term is about what you’d pay for a year ofSurfsharkor a year ofMullvad, but considerably less than the $140 you’d pay for NordVPN or the $117 for ExpressVPN. However, the difference between CyberGhost and any of the other VPNs mentioned above is that the others are all well worth their price. If you’re looking for tons of features or unique privacy tools, you won’t find them with CyberGhost. The “Advanced Features” listed in the MacOS app include the adblocker and the Wi-Fi protection settings, which are standard settings offered by many VPNs. CyberGhost’s Windows app provides the most options for customizing your experience, but nothing that sets it apart from the pack. The Windows app offers quick access to servers optimized forgaming, torrenting and streaming, as well as CyberGhost’s fleet of NoSpy servers -- which are wholly owned and operated by CyberGhost and therefore offer “better speeds and stronger security,” according to the company. Confusingly, the NoSpy servers are accessible only on CyberGhost’s other apps if you search for Romania in the server search bar and tap on the arrow to display the list of servers in Romania. The NoSpy servers are accessible only to users who purchase the six-month or two-year plans. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed in GyberGhost’s meager feature set and its shaky app performance -- especially considering how smoothly other VPN apps like NordVPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark perform across platforms. The others are a breeze to use, but I couldn’t wait to get CyberGhost off my devices. CyberGhost conveniently offers servers optimized forstreamingthat are easily accessible in the app via the sidebar. A few other VPNs, like PIA, have servers optimized for streaming, but I like how CyberGhost’s servers are optimized for specific streaming platforms across the globe and how vast the international streaming selection is. CyberGhost has servers optimized for various countries’NetflixandDisney Pluslibraries, Paramount Plus, Peacock, RTVE in Spain, Now TV and BBC iPlayer in the UK, DRTV in Denmark, TV4Play in Sweden and C MORE in Finland -- just to name a few. In all, there are more than 100 servers optimized for various international streaming platforms, which is impressive and great for anyone looking to access a literal world of streaming options. During my testing, I was able to access content from various regional Netflix libraries and watch titles like Dexter, Breaking Bad and Your Honor. I also watched Schitt’s Creek and The Old Man on Hulu, Fallout and Spongebob Squarepants on Amazon Prime Video and Aladdin on Disney Plus. Although CyberGhost doesn’t have servers optimized for Apple TV Plus, I was still able to access content on the platform and stream The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy and a documentary on dads, appropriately titled… Dads. Streaming with CyberGhost was a breeze on a laptop, mobile device andAmazon’s Fire TV Stick. Although CyberGhostboasts on its websitethat it’s the bestApple TV VPN, it still doesn’t have an actual app for Apple TV devices. To be fair, VPN support on Apple TV is still relatively new, and not every VPN has an app for the device yet. However, many of the big players like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark and PIA have had an app for Apple TV for some time now and others like Proton VPN have recently rolled out support for Apple TV. A CyberGhost representative told me via email that the VPN should have an Apple TV app sometime towards the end of the year, but the app is still unavailable as of December 2024. The apps look cool, but they’re buggy and a pain to use. After extensively testing CyberGhost for several weeks, it was evident how superior all of CNET’s best VPN picks are to CyberGhost’s offering. The app bugginess is perhaps most apparent on the MacOS app, which consistently takes over a minute to launch after clicking the icon in the dock to open the app. I’ve been critical aboutSurfshak’s app taking some time to connect, but CyberGhost is on another level. The app seems to take forever to connect to a server, and sometimes stalls completely. And when the client stalls, the internet connection on my Mac is totally severed, even after I quit the app. It’s only after I reboot my system that I can regain my internet connection on that machine. As an Apple user, I’m used to a slick, responsive and intuitive interface -- CyberGhost’s MacOS app is the opposite, making for an incredibly frustrating experience. CyberGhost’s Windows app wasn’t much better, although it did resolve an issue I had when testing earlier this year. It was marginally more responsive than the MacOS app, but connection times were still sluggish. I encountered a rather bothersome bug during my initial tests over the summer while attempting to use the OpenVPN protocol. At the time, the Windows app connected just fine when I had set the client to connect via OpenVPN, but when I went to use the internet, I was blocked from accessing any website I tried to visit when connected to a server. It was only after I disabled thekill switch(a crucial privacy feature) that I could access the internet through OpenVPN on CyberGhost’s Windows app. Every time I clicked on the Send Feedback button to gather connection logs to send to CyberGhost engineers to diagnose the issue, the app completely crashed. The only way I was able to access the internet using OpenVPN on Windows with the kill switch on was when I enabled the “Use new OpenVPN network driver” beta feature. CyberGhost told me in July that engineers were working on an update to the Windows app that would resolve the issue by enabling the WinTUN adapter by default. Upon retesting in December, the permanent fix seems to be in because I no longer had any issues accessing the internet using OpenVPN with the kill switch enabled. During my testing, CyberGhost’s iOS app was the only app that was halfway somewhat OK to use. It’s the only app I had no explicit issue with. CyberGhost’siOS approutinely connected swiftly and was easy to navigate. Servers were easy to locate, and selecting between standard servers and streaming-optimized servers was convenient. However, other than that, the app is mostly devoid of feature settings. You can pick between WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols and choose whether the app automatically connects or disconnects to secure Wi-Fi or public Wi-Fi, but that’s essentially it. Minutes after installing and beginning to use CyberGhost’sAndroidclient, the app became unresponsive, and I couldn’t connect to any server I tried, regardless of which protocol I selected. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it working properly again -- not the end of the world, but quite unsatisfactory nevertheless from a user’s perspective. Once I reinstalled the Android app, I was able to give the app a proper evaluation. Like its iOS counterpart, CyberGhost’s Android app connects quickly (when it’s working) and is simple to navigate. It also has the same Wi-Fi protection feature and a protocol selection feature (WireGuard and OpenVPN), but it has a couple of extras that aren’t included in the iOS app. CyberGhost’s Android app has a split tunneling feature alongside an ad, tracker and malware blocker -- both of which worked as expected during my testing. Key takeaway:CyberGhost’s streaming performance is its biggest strength and one of the few bright spots with the service. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite make up for the failings of its apps. For a similar price or less than you’d pay for CyberGhost, you can get far superior performance on basically every front and a fuller feature set with any of the VPNs on CNET’s list of the best VPNs. CyberGhost offers a 45-day money-back guarantee, which is more generous than what most other providers offer. But, honestly, you might not need the full 45 days to figure out whether CyberGhost is right for you. CyberGhost does a lot of things right when it comes to privacy, security and transparency. It also does a few things that have left me perplexed. Like most VPNs articulate in one way or another, CyberGhost says that it is “hyper-paranoid” about your privacy, but I don’t always see that ethos play out in practice. While I like that CyberGhost is headquartered in Romania (aprivacy-friendly jurisdictionand outside the 14-Eyes), the company’sprivacy policystates that it may communicate personal data “to a member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC, and all its subsidiaries, in so far as they are located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards).” The privacy policy identifies personal data as things like your name, address, e-mail address, username and payment information, as well as your IP address and approximate location when visiting the website. Kape Technologies is a UK-based entity that owns other VPNs ExpressVPN and PIA, along with Intego Antivirus. Kape also owns Webselenese, which runs a portfolio of comparison/review sites, including vpnMentor and Wizcase. (Incidentally, both vpnMentor and Wizcase rank Kape-owned providers ExpressVPN, CyberGhost and PIA as their top three VPN picks -- in that order.) “Personal information in this sense refers to data necessary for account administration and other similar areas. Occasionally there are cross-brand projects to ensure better and more secure operation of our systems. These projects could, for example, take website usage information to check user interest in particular functions to then inform the resource we dedicate to improving said function,” a CyberGhost representative told me via email. “... none of this data is associated with VPN use which is not logged or stored on our RAM-only servers. No data is linked to user activity.” Obviously, if CyberGhost is logging or sharing data related to user activity in the VPN tunnel with anyone, that would be a massive problem. But sharing personal data associated with account administration and website usage can still be a deal-breaker for users concerned about their privacy. CyberGhost states that it can share your personal data with any of these companies -- some of which are located within 14-Eyes jurisdictions (PIA and Intego in the US and Kape in the UK). That essentially makes CyberGhost’s Romanian jurisdiction moot. This stands in stark contrast to CyberGhost’s sister companyExpressVPN’s privacy policy, which clearly states that “Any personal information associated with ExpressVPN accounts is controlled only by ExpressVPN, including being stored on systems, servers, and services owned or leased by ExpressVPN and its subsidiaries.” The policy goes on to clarify that “In the limited circumstances where this data may need to be processed by other related entities, it may be shared only when required, and for the duration required, for processing solely related to the purposes and legitimate interests outlined in this Privacy Policy, while ensuring at all times the same data protection standards. For avoidance of doubt, these circumstances do not include any situations where control of personal information of ExpressVPN users will be transferred to any other related entities, including but not limited to our ultimate holding company, Kape Technologies PLC, for any duration of time.” ExpressVPN’s privacy policy also makes it clear that the company operates under the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands and in accordance with BVI law. CyberGhost’s privacy policy, on the other hand, states only that the company is registered in Romania. CyberGhost uses industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption to secure OpenVPN connections, AES 128-bit encryption for IKEv2 connections and ChaCha20 for WireGuard. Its entire server infrastructure runs on RAM-only, so data is theoretically never saved to a hard disk and is wiped each time the server is rebooted. This adds peace of mind that the company wouldn’t be able to provide user data to authorities if requested because the data simply doesn’t exist. To be clear, this means data that may pass through a VPN server, not the personal data that CyberGhost shares with its parent and sister companies. CyberGhost’sno-logs policystates that “we ensure that we do NOT track user traffic performed inside the CyberGhost VPN tunnel such as: browsing history, traffic destination, search preferences, data content, IP addresses or DNS queries.” A no-logging policy is an important trust signal for any VPN provider to communicate to its users. However, it’s crucial to keep in mind that no-logs claims are impossible to verify with 100% certainty. External audits and real-world legal cases can help add credence to a VPN’s no-logs policies, but they can still only go so far because they can only shed light on the VPN’s logging practices during the course of the audit or at the time of the legal case. CyberGhost has thus far completed two external audits: One in 2022 and another earlier this year in January, 2024. Both audits were completed by Deloitte and confirmed that CyberGhost was not logging user activity during each audit. Anyone can request a PDF copy of the full 2022 audit report directly from Deloitte by filling out a contact form, but the 2024 audit report is only available to CyberGhost users and can be downloaded from the user dashboard online. “Because of the extensive nature of the audit and the scope of Deloitte services, excerpts from the report cannot be shared directly,” CyberGhost says. “This measure ensures the audit results are not taken out of context or misunderstood.” This is essentially the same language that NordVPN uses in itsblog postabout its most recent Deloitte audit, but other VPNs like Surfshark have at least shared asummaryof their audit reports with the public. CyberGhost told me via email that its 2024 Deloitte audit was “​​the final deliverable on CyberGhost's current agreement with Deloitte,” but that the company is committed to delivering audit reports on a regular basis going forward. Ideally, I’d like to see audit reports on an annual basis, but if CyberGhost is able to commit to an audit every two years, that’s still better than what most VPNs deliver. Audits can be expensive and time-consuming, butregular audits are crucialbecause they can provide consistent validation that the VPN provider is most likely doing what it says it’s doing, even if the auditing company can only confirm what’s going on over the course of the audit itself. In addition to external audits, some VPNs deliver transparency reports that detail the number and nature of the legal requests they receive and how they responded to the requests during a given time period. Transparency reports are important in building trust with the public that the VPN doesn’t have any useful data that it can share in response to the legal requests it gets. CyberGhost is a pioneer in transparency reports -- in 2011, it was the first VPN provider to issue a transparency report, publishing them annually until 2019, when the provider began issuingquarterly transparency reports. CyberGhost goes above and beyond, delivering by far the most detailed and in-depth transparency reports in the VPN industry. Each quarterly report is nicely laid out and filled with informative graphics and tons of information not only about legal requests but also about its server infrastructure and what the company has been working on. Overall, I’m very impressed with CyberGhost’s commitment to transparency through its audits and its thorough transparency reports. I didn’t observe any DNS leaks with CyberGhost during my testing, but I did notice that my actual IP address and location were exposed on both MacOS and Windows when jumping from one server directly to another. This occurred even though the MacOS app has a built-in kill switch, and I enabled the kill switch on the Windows app. The MacOS app even displayed a popup stating that the client activated the kill switch to protect my privacy, but my true IP address was nevertheless exposed. This is dangerous because your IP address, location and online activity can be exposed if your VPN disconnects even for a second. On top of that, when the VPN specifically tells you that its kill switch is protecting your privacy when it’s really not, you’re given a false sense of security. CyberGhost representatives told me that this isn’t expected behavior and that the team is researching a long-term solution. As a quick fix in the meantime, CyberGhost rolled out an update to the Windows and MacOS apps that includes a warning notification when a user moves between servers. While the VPN's security is tight for the most part, CyberGhost engages in some questionable tactics that I’d classify as borderline privacy-unfriendly (and not in line with the provider’s claim that it’s “hyper-paranoid” about user privacy). For one, CyberGhost has claims of “anonymity” peppered throughout its website and in its app onboarding process. The problem with this is that complete anonymity online is amyth. But CyberGhost perpetuates the myth anyway, telling visitors toone particular pagethat they can “Go completely anonymous and surf the internet without privacy worries.” Anotherboldly proclaimsthat users can “Enjoy complete anonymity & protection online!” after setting up CyberGhost VPN. Telling folks that your VPN will make them anonymous online is almost reckless because it’s another way to lead users into a false sense of security. VPNs provide online privacy, not anonymity -- a VPN provider as established as CyberGhost should know that. Another thing that had me scratching my head is how CyberGhost attempts to almost trick users into sharing diagnostic data with the company during app onboarding. As you’re getting started with the app and before you can actually begin using the VPN, you’ll have to get past a screen with a heading boldly stating that “Your privacy is our goal.” Beneath that, you’re hit with a wall of text that begins with a lot of meaningless fluff about CyberGhost being your ally in the fight for your privacy -- stuff that most people probably won’t read in its entirety. Further down towards the end of the text, you’ll find out what the page actually wants you to agree to -- sending CyberGhost more of your data. CyberGhost's tricky attempt to collect additional data It’s set up almost like a terms of service agreement where you just instinctively click on “Agree” without reading the text. The page features a prominent “Agree & continue” button highlighted in bright yellow at the bottom. The “I want to opt-out” option is far less conspicuous, not highlighted, in smaller text and wedged down at the very bottom of the screen. Tactics like these are called dark patterns, which are tricky user interface (UI) designs intended to steer users to take actions that are often not in their best interest. When you click on “Agree & continue,” you’ll send CyberGhost data, including your operating system and version, device type and whether you’re a free or paid user. The text on the page says that the data can’t be traced to you and is used for troubleshooting and to scale the VPN’s infrastructure. Even if the data isn’t linked to you, it’s still additional data that you’re sending to CyberGhost -- so for more privacy-minded folks or those concerned with their data being re-identified, it’s better to opt out and provide as little data as humanly possible. VPNs gathering anonymized data to improve their services can ultimately be helpful to the end user, but there are ways to go about it that don’t involve using dark patterns like CyberGhost does. A VPN that truly cares about your privacy will have the option disabled by default and operate strictly on an opt-in basis. Key takeaway:I like CyberGhost’s transparency efforts, but I don’t buy that it’s “hyper-paranoid” about your privacy. If you’re a streaming enthusiast or need servers in tons of different locations, CyberGhost is a decent choice. Unfortunately, that’s about the extent of it. I really wanted to like CyberGhost, but it was just too riddled with bugs, and I was disappointed that the company engages in some questionable data-sharing practices. I did like how I could access every streaming service I tried on various devices, including Amazon’s Fire TV Stick on my TV. And although I'm disappointed that CyberGhost didn't release an Apple TV app this year, I'm looking forward to trying it out when it does come out. Even with its relatively middling speeds, streaming was a breeze with CyberGhost. I was really impressed with CyberGhost’s vast server network, which boasts one of the most diverse sets of global servers I’ve seen in a VPN. However, I just couldn’t get past how buggy the app was -- sometimes to the point of being essentially unusable. I'm also rather discouraged by how little CyberGhost has done to improve the quality of its offering over the past half year. Engineers remedied the kill switch issue on Windows, but little else was done to make CyberGhost a more attractive option for VPN users. Hopefully, the coming year will include a stronger effort to iron out the bugs and make using the app a smooth experience. While I appreciate CyberGhost’s commitment to transparency, I’d also like to see the company make some adjustments in favor of user privacy going forward. As it stands, I can't in good conscience recommend CyberGhost to anyone with heightened online privacy needs.","CyberGhost has the potential to be a good VPN, but it has done little over the past few months to improve its unremarkable offering.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/cyberghost-vpn-review-2024/,

What to consider Budget Know how much you want to spend before you start researching, because the high end is frequently above $150. Noise-isolating or open design Knowing your earbuds aren't going to fly away when you're working out is important, but you also need to choose if you want to hear the world around you or not. Comfort Even if you're only wearing these headphones while working out, the right fit makes all the difference. Durability Normal headphones aren't made for all the sweat and movement work out headphones endure, so it's important to make sure you have something you know will last. Return policy Be careful where you buy from, so if you aren't happy with your purchase you can try something else. During intense workouts, I'm always fearful of my earbuds falling out and being damaged, or worse, losing them completely. This fear is further exacerbated when I'm at the gym or running down rough country roads. One wrong move, and it's all over, and, as we all know, technology can be pretty pricey. While I could useover-the-ear headphones, the reality is that I don't really want to get my sweat or anything else on them and ruin their quality. Fortunately, there is a solution to make your earbuds stay where they are: ear hooks. Not only do they offer extra support for a snug fit, but they stay in place during fast or vigorous movements and make your workout worry-free. Read more:Best workout headphones Given the wide variety of models available, it's hard to name one as the best overall, but a few stand out from the pack. TheBose Ultra Open Earbuds-- which hook onto your ears, not over them -- and the Shokz OpenFit are my top picks for their sound, design and fit. I also like the newSoundcore by Anker X20as an excellent value pick. Check out all of our top-tested picks for the best earbuds with ear hooks. Most are affordable, with prices generally under $100, making themgreat holiday giftsfor runners or workout enthusiasts, too. The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds. SCORE The Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. They don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. Fully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 has slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent, athough not exceptionally good. Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. Models like the OpenRun Pro, which deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones, are popular with runners and bikers who like to leave their ears open for safety reasons. However, Shokz's new OpenFit model, the company's first true wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs ""air conduction"" technology. I was impressed by how lightweight (8.3 grams) and comfortable they are. They have one of the best ear-hook designs I've tried (Shokz calls it a Dolphin Arc ear hook). It's soft and offers just the right amount of flexibility to conform to the shape of your ear, with ""dual-layered liquid silicone that provides a pliable fit,"" according to Shokz. The earbuds also sound quite good for open earbuds, although not quite as good as Cleer's Arc 2 Open Ear Sport earbuds which also have an ear-hook design. 1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. The Fit S50 buds are the flagship ($120) and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value. The case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. The Soundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro are among the best open-ear ""air conduction"" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job reducing background noise reduction) and also offer strong battery life, up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels. While they don't have ear-detection sensors, I liked that they have physical buttons to control playback and also come with a cord, should you want to turn them into neckband-style wireless headphones. It's also worth noting that they have a spatial audio feature and offer the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android smartphones that support Bluetooth streaming. Anker's standard AeroFit fit model ($100) has smaller drivers (14mm versus 16.2mm for the Pro), so it doesn't sound quite as good and also has a battery life rating of 11 hours. However, those buds are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, while these are splash-proof with an IPX5 rating. JBL has upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds for 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case) improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have a conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears. They stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, though they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. That said, the buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes. Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new ""enhanced"" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which make for a significantly improved product. Cleer says the Arc 2 Sport buds feature ""greater flexibility for improved comfort,"" and I did find them more comfortable to wear than the original Arcs. That said, not everyone loves this style of open earbuds, which lets sound in so you can hear ambient sound around you for safety purposes. With a new six-axis motion sensor, you can actually control the buds with head gestures -- you answer calls by nodding and skip tracks forward by turning your head to the right and skip a trackback by turning your head left. Thankfully, those motion controls can be turned off if you don't want to use them. These are among the first buds to support Qualcomm's aptX Lossless format if you're one of the few to have an Android device that supports that audio codec (plenty of Android phones support aptX Adaptive). Since these aren't high-end noise-isolating earbuds, you probably won't be able to tell the difference in sound quality -- I couldn't -- but all that aside, these do sound very good for open-style earbuds. They lack a bit of oomph to their bass but they're punchy enough, offer good clarity and don't distort at higher volumes. They also played sufficiently loud. They have an IPX5 water- and sweat-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water and battery life is very good at up to eight hours on a single charge. In addition, there are a little more than three additional charges in the slim but still somewhat bulky charging case. It's big compared to an AirPods charging case, but svelte compared to other cases that house this style of earbuds. These offer respectable performance for voice calls, but callers did say they heard a certain amount of white noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York -- that whooshing sound is the by-product of the earbuds' noise-reduction efforts. With so many new wireless earbuds and headphones being released on what seems likely a weekly basis, it's not easy for companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Skullcandy hopes its new voice-driven platform, Skull-iQ Smart Feature Technology, will do just that. Similar to the Apple AirPods' ""Hey Siri"" feature, Skullcandy's version allows you to say ""Hey, Skullcandy"" to issue hands-free voice commands without touching a button. Skull-iQ debuts on the sports-oriented Push Active, and the $100 Grind Fuel, which will be firmware updatable via the Skullcandy App. With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this is one of the better ones. The Push Active True earbuds are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, are IP55 splashproof, have built-in Tile Finding Technology and are rated for up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels. The Beats Powerbeats Pro earbuds have been on the market for several years but remain popular and are now available in several color options. Their jumbo charging case is a notable drawback, but they offer many of the same features as Apple's original AirPods Pro (they're equipped with Apple's H1 chip) but have better sound so long as you get a tight seal (they should fit most -- but not all -- ears well). There's no active noise canceling but battery life is strong at up to 9 hours and they're IPX4 splash-proof. Note that the Powerbeats Pro are frequently on sale, so you should only buy them if they're substantially discounted. SCORE The OpenRock Pro buds aren't so different from a lot of open sports earbuds with ear hooks that cost a little more than $100, but their charging case is different. Most of these types of buds lie flat in their charging case. These slide vertically into their charging compartments and the case closes from the top -- a little like a Zippo lighter. They're sturdily built, comfortable to wear and feature good sound for open ear buds with ample bass thanks to 16.2mm drivers. Voice-calling performance is also decent -- they have four microphones. Available in black or silver, they're IPX5 water-resistant (they can withstand a sustained spray of water) and have excellent battery life -- up to 19 hours at moderate volume levels. There are several open earbuds on Amazon with an ear hook design that's similar to that of the Oladance OWS2 buds. But these buds look and feel a little more premium than many of those. This second-gen model includes some upgrades, including Bluetooth 5.3, multipoint Bluetooth pairing capabilities and increased battery life (up to 19 hours on a single charge at 50% volume). I found them comfortable to wear and they have a little bit bigger sound than some of these open sport buds (they have 16.5 mm drivers), though they do distort a tad at higher volumes. I also liked their glossy finish in the orange color I tried. The case is slim but a bit long, and the buds are a little pricey at $150, but overall they performed well and seem durable. They're IPX4 splashproof. These are also often on sale, so keep an eye out. Oladance also makes the newer OWS Pro, which have a lighter design and a smaller charging case, but those buds cost $230. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless sports buds with ear hooks. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headpones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150. Sports buds with ear hooks are available in a couple of styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons. It's key that sports earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation. Since all the buds on this list have ear hooks, they should stay on your ears well. Some will fit your ears more comfortably than others. You want sports buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating. It's critical to buy your sports at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. We test true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,features,voice-calling performanceandvalue. Baseus Eli Sport 1:The Eli Sport 1 can be had for around $80. While they may not sound quite as good as some of the premium open earbuds out there -- there can be a touch of distortion at higher volumes with bass-heavy tracks -- they sound quite decent for their modest price and I found them comfortable to wear. They look more premium than their price would indicate. They have 16.2mm drivers, are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. Samsung Galaxy Buds FE:Carrying a list price of around $100, Samsung's 2023 Galaxy Buds FE feature a single driver (Samsung isn't saying what size it is), three mics on each earbud and active noise canceling. They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes. Bose Frames (Tempo) (Out of Stock):The Bose Frames are one of those products you have to try to fully appreciate -- or dismiss. The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world. Jabra Elite 8 Active:Equipped with six microphones instead of four, slightly improved adaptive noise canceling and wind-reduction technology along with a higher durability rating, the Elite 8 Active looks, feels and performs like a modestly upgraded version of the Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active. Jabra is billing them as the ""world's toughest earbuds,"" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS:What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound, but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof. Not necessarily. Buds with integrated ear hooks or wingtips (or sports fins) are designed to help keep your earbuds in your ears. It's really a design preference. Some people like the look and feel of earbuds with ear hooks while others prefer earbuds with sports fins. If you're looking for an open buds design, you're more likely to find open earbuds with ear hooks than sport fins. Because they're bigger than your typical earbuds, earbuds with ear hooks usually come with a fairly large charging case that may not fit so well in a pants pocket (especially tight jeans). We're seeing better designs for not only the buds themselves (and the ear hooks) but the cases are getting more compact. Generally, excellent and usually significantly better than what you get with standard earbuds. That's because earbuds with ear hooks are large and can house bigger batteries. Typical battery life ratings for buds with ear hooks are in the 10-15 hour range while traditional true-wireless earbuds are usually rated for anywhere from 5-8 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels.","If you have an active lifestyle, then opt for more secure earbuds with flexible ear hooks.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-true-wireless-sports-earbuds-with-ear-hooks/,

The Pixel 8A is so good it makes the regular Pixel 8 almost feel irrelevant. It shares so much in common with its pricier sibling, from its selection of AI-powered features like Circle to Search to its cool aesthetic and powerful Tensor G3 processor, that it’s hard to see why anyone would buy the Pixel 8 instead. The Pixel 8 does offer a marginally better camera system, a slightly larger screen and the ability to charge other phones and accessories wirelessly on the back of the device. But those features don’t feel significant enough to impact the buying decision for most people. As I wrote inmy review, the Pixel 8A raises the bar for what a $500 phone should be. That also means I’ll be expecting more from the Pixel 9 this fall. TheMotorola Moto G Power 5Gis the most versatile option in this roundup, offering wireless charging, a 120Hz high refresh rate screen, Google Pay for contactless payments and a fantastic vegan leather design. Combine that with a camera that takes decent photos in bright environments, and a processor that is capable for most daily tasks, and you have a phone that’s both fun to use without cramming itself with the extra bells and whistles we see in higher priced phones. Even though this phone does suffer from having a shorter software and security support timeline (1 year of major Android OS, three years of security updates) than Samsung’s Galaxy A25 5G, it is a more useful device. And it's this appeal that makes the Moto G Power 5G our top recommendation for a phone that costs $300 or less. At $599, theiPhone 14is a great buy and solid upgrade, especially if you're using an 11 or older. There are two models the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and the6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plusthat normally starts at $699. Both phones are identical and really the deciding factor comes down to screen and battery size as well as price. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a long battery life, fast performance, great durability and wonderful cameras as well as safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Both phones came out in September 2022 originally but are still solid options today. In terms of drawbacks, neither phone has a high refresh rate screen, and always-on display or the newer Action button found on the 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series. But at hundreds of dollars less, we think that the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the best value to the dollar that Apple currently sells. The $500 OnePlus 12R might not be the best phone you can buy, but it does offer solid overall performance for its reasonable price tag. Its older-generation processor still packs plenty of power for gaming, its camera setup is fine for casual snappers and it's got a similar design to its more premium sibling. But you also get 80W fast charging which will take it from empty to full in a little over 30 minutes, while the screen has wet-touch tech that means you can still use it accurately in the rain. It's a shame this phone doesn't have longer software support, but it's otherwise a decent all-rounder if you're shopping on a budget. Samsung's Galaxy A03Sat $160 (£126, roughly AU$244) includes great features and could be a fit for someone in need of a cheap phone that can handle essential tasks. The phone's 6.5-inch screen, capped at 720p resolution, is great for reading the news, watching videos and playing games. Despite some performance lag during our review, the phone is good at multitasking. The tiny 32GB of storage space could fill up fast, so if you're considering this phone, you might want to expand the storage with a microSD card. Samsung also plans to support this phone with at least four years of security updates, which in this price range is as good as it gets. On the software side, it's less clear how many Android versions are scheduled, but the phone initially ships with Android 11. Motorola’s $200 Moto G 5G for 2024 arrived with a splash. The phone kept many highlights of its higher-priced $250 2023 model like a 120Hz refresh rate screen and dual speakers. The Moto G 5G also has an improved design and functionality with a new vegan leather look and NFC for contactless payments. And its cameras can take photos with decent color accuracy, despite soft details. But performance and a short software update timeline both hurt the Moto G 5G. While the phone is capable of running all sorts of apps and games, multitasking on its small 4GB of RAM is challenging. Even with Motorola’s RAM boost feature, which simulates an additional 4GB of RAM using built-in storage, apps would often need to reload when swapping between them. And Motorola has not budged from its policy of providing one major software update and three years of security updates to the Moto G line, which limits the number of years you can safely use the phone before needing to replace it. Editor's note: Google released the Pixel 8A, also $500. You canread our Pixel 8A review here. If you're buying a Pixel 7A make sure it's on sale. Google's budget phone took a leap forward in 2023 with thePixel 7A, which offers many of the same benefits as thePixel 7but at a cheaper price. Like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, meaning it has many of the same photo editing and language translation features as its pricier sibling. The Pixel 7A's 64-megapixel camera also takes excellent photos that rival the Pixel 7's in quality. While we still like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A's lower price makes it a better deal for most people. Otherwise, themain differencesbetween the Pixel 7 and 7A come down to the former's more durable build, slightly faster charging and its ability to wirelessly charge compatible accessories. The Pixel 7 also has a larger camera sensor that's more sensitive to light, according to Google, but CNET's Lisa Eadicicco didn't notice much of a difference. The TCL 50 XL 5G includes an impressive amount of specs for $160. This is one of the cheapest phones I’ve seen so far that includes a 120Hz refresh rate display and NFC for Google Pay and contactless payments. It also includes 6GB of memory, which made the phone breeze through multitasking during my testing. But the TCL 50 XL 5G does show compromises from its low price in other ways. Even though it has a big 5,010-mAh battery, it drains quickly -- possibly because it’s powering a large 6.78-inch 1080p display with a low-end processor. Cameras struggle to take photos with clean, crisp details, in both well-lit and lowlight situations. It’s carrier-locked to T-Mobile as well, making it only useful when running on the magenta carrier or its Metro prepaid brand. And it’s also only set for one software update and three years of security updates, which matches what Motorola provides but is still low compared to Samsung. But if you're on T-Mobile, the TCL 50 XL 5G is a serious value for its $160, and helps excuse some of its faults. But you should still be aware of them. Samsung’s $200 Galaxy A15 5G is an easy choice for someone looking to buy a phone that will last for years. Samsung provides it with four years of software updates and five years of security support, which in this price range is unparalleled. Plus the phone supports 25W wired charging that in my testing was able to charge half of its big 5,000-mAh battery from empty in 30 minutes. I also like the eye-catching light blue option. A $200 phone has to have some compromises. The Galaxy A15 5G feels sluggish compared to competing phones like Motorola’s $200 Moto G 5G, and as an entertainment machine falls short with its single audio speaker that is blocked by accident when you hold the phone sideways for games and video. Photography, which is typically a weak point on phones in this price range, is similarly mixed with decent photography in outdoor environments while struggling to photograph lowlight spaces. This makes the Galaxy A15 5G an easy choice for when you just need a phone that can handle the basics, but you may want to consider other options if you are looking for the best pocket YouTube player in this price range. The $429 iPhone SE is a mix of an older design with the latest smartphone features, including Apple's A15 Bionic chip and 5G support. It's also one of the few phones on the market that includes a smaller, 4.7-inch screen. It's that throwback design that could be what you love or dislike most about this phone. If you want a larger iPhone in this price range, you can also consider a refurbishediPhone 12, and get a bigger screen and Face ID. The phone also includes only one, 12-megapixel main camera, which doesn't support night mode. Most other phones in this roundup include multiple cameras along with features like night mode, making the omission noticeable. Photos make up for this by including theDeep Fusion photo-processing techniqueto enhance medium- to low-light photos, and Smart HDR4 processing for improving color and contrast. CNET Managing Editor Patrick Holland did find thatvideo shot in 4K resolution at 60 frames per secondis particularly good on the iPhone SE, but it won't include the Cinematic Mode seen on the iPhone 13. At $700, theiPhone 15isn't necessarily considered cheap. Compared to the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, it's much more affordable. In 2024, the iPhone 15 is still one of the best Apple phones you can buy. It has a 6.1-inch screen, great dual-rear cameras and an outstanding battery life. It's worth a look if you can work it into your budget. Every phone on this list has been thoroughly tested by CNET's expert reviews team. We use the phone, test the features, play games and take photos. We assess any marketing promises that a company makes about its phones. If we find something we don't like -- be it battery life or build quality -- we tell you about it. We examine every aspect of a phone during testing: We test all the phone's cameras (both front and back) in a variety of conditions: from outdoors under sunlight to dimmer indoor locales and nighttime scenes (for any available night modes). We also compare our findings against similarly priced models. We have a series of real-world battery tests to see how long a phone lasts under everyday use. We account for additional phone features like 5G, fingerprint and face readers, styluses, fast charging, foldable displays and other useful extras. We weigh all our experiences and testing against the price so you know whether a phone represents good value.

Decide on Android or iPhone:Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone.

Pick the most important feature:Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Yes, many of the cheap phones included in this list are available at a discount during shopping events. For instance, the Google Pixel 7A's price can drop as low as $350 when it's on sale. If you have a phone in mind but also have the flexibility to hold off for a shopping event like Black Friday, it may be worth it to wait for a price reduction. Yes, many cheap phones are available unlocked by the manufacturer. This allows you to use the phone with nearly any wireless carrier by inserting your SIM card. If you want the flexibility to switch carriers, make sure you buy an unlocked model.

359,"Bluesky Climbs to 25 Million Users, Including Luke Skywalker: Should You Join?","The social network Bluesky has been growing at a rapid rate ever since the US presidential election concluded. The site has added over 11 million users since the election on Nov. 5, pushing it to over 25 million users by Dec. 17.  Star Wars starMark Hamill recently joined the site, proclaiming himself a ""Twitter quitter."" AndRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York became the first person to reach over 1 million followers on the platform. That's the first for any Bluesky account except the company's own. Ocasio-Cortez has 1.1 million followers as of Tuesday. There are at least two ever-changing counters created by Bluesky users that track the site's numbers.One counteris from Theo Sanderson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine;another counteris by a user who simply goes by Natalie on the site. Read more:Bluesky Starter Packs: How to Find and Create Them A representative for the company said in an email last month that the site had added over 1 million users a day in the period immediately after the election. That rate equals about 12 new users per second. The 25 million user mark compares to 9 million users in September. Bluesky may be surging, but the site has a way to go to catch competing sites.Forbes reportsthat X has 588 million global users as of September, a drop from 611 million in April.Threads, Meta's competitor to X, has more than 275 million daily users. Although there's no way to determine how many new users left because of X owner Elon Musk's public support for President-elect Donald Trump, many Bluesky users are referencing the election in their first posts.Wired reportsthat many Taylor Swift fans, a group that once had a large presence on X, are switching to Bluesky. Bluesky is a social media platform that shares many similarities with X, formerly known as Twitter. X underwent a number of changes after billionaire Muskbought the siteand retired legacyblue check marks showing verified accounts,reinstated previously banned accountsand started anew subscription program. On Oct. 16,X announcedthat it was changing its block function, which allowed people to stop others from seeing their messages on the site. Accounts that have been blocked can now see that person's posts on X if the posts are set to public, though they cannot reply, like or repost them. ""That's not blocking,""one X user replied. ""That's supporting stalking."" The following day, Oct. 17,Bluesky shared a postannouncing that it had welcomed 500,000 people in just one day. ""First day here,""one Bluesky userwrote in response to the company's post about its growth. ""Just getting my feet wet. Was a longtime Twitter user but it's a shell of what it used to be."" X has also updated its terms of service so that any lawsuits by users against the service must be handled by a federal court in north Texas ""whose judges frequently deliver victories to conservative litigants in political cases,""The Globe and Mail reports. These latest changes may have sparked the rise of interest in Bluesky, which saw asurge in user accountsearlier this year when X was blocked by courts in Brazil (the block was laterlifted when X paid a fine). According toThe New York Times, users say Bluesky is the app that comes closest to mimicking X. Read more:Bluesky Is the Small Comfort I'd Been Looking For. Let's Hope It Lasts Here's a look at what you need to know about Bluesky. To join, just go to the main page tocreate an account. You can download the Bluesky app foriOSorAndroid, or use Bluesky on your desktop. It'll ask for your email address and phone number (to send an authentication code) and tell you to choose a username and password. Then you're in. If you're accustomed to X, Bluesky's design and purpose should make sense to you. The site uses vertically scrolling messages with small round photo avatars for users and icons under messages showing how many comments, likes and reposts they've received. It looks pretty similar to X's format andMeta's Threads, which is the current No. 2 free app on the App Store, behind Bluesky. Read more:Time to Cut Off Your X (Twitter)? Here's How Here's another Twitter/X connection: Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was formerly on the board of directors, and the Bluesky projectbegan in 2019when he was Twitter CEO.Jay Graberis the Bluesky CEO. Even Bluesky's name is related to X's former name. Dorsey confirmed a Bluesky user's speculation that the name ties in to Twitter's bird mascot, the idea being the bird could fly even more freely in an open blue sky.Dorsey left the board in May, apparently because the service added moderation tools. Even though the name of the site doesn't capitalize the S in ""sky,"" it's pronounced ""blue sky."" Don't rhyme it with ""brewski."" The app is built on something called theauthenticated transport protocol, or AT, a social media framework created by the company and made up of a network of many different sites. For one thing, you can set your domain as your handle, if you wish. This could help with verification, which became a heated issue for Twitter once Musk began removing blue check marks from verified accounts that refused to pay a monthly fee. ""For example, a newsroom like NPR could set their handle to be @npr.org,"" theBluesky Social company blog notes. ""Then, any journalists that NPR wants to verify could use subdomains to set their handles to be @name.npr.org. Brand accounts could set their handle to be their domain as well."" Moderation is also different.Another blog postsays that Bluesky is already using automated moderating, and has a system of community labeling, which is described as ""something similar to shared mute/block lists."" Users of many social media platforms are shown posts from a feed selected for them by an algorithm, though you can influence that by following or blocking certain accounts. But Bluesky wants to give you a chance to pick from avariety of different algorithmsto determine what you see. You can mute accounts, which prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from them, or you can block accounts, which takes that a step further, meaning you and the other account both cannot see or interact with each other's posts. And you can report posts or accounts for abuse. The blocking option may be of special interest to users who were unhappy with X's recent change in its blocking behavior. A couple of features -- being able to hide replies to your posts and detach your posts from other users' posts that quote yours -- aredesigned to stop pile-ons and other toxicbehavior. It's possible that creators who acquire a following on Bluesky might one day be able tokeep connectionswith those who follow them, even if the service itself changes. If you want to follow the people you followed on X, the third-partySky Follower Bridgeis a free tool that scans your follower list and follows accounts with the same names on Bluesky. You'll get a few false positives and a lot of dormant Bluesky accounts, but overall we've found it works very well. Algorithms are the rules that determine how content is filtered and recommended to users. Bluesky has something it calls custom feeds, which allows you to choose the algorithm that determines what you see. ""Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports -- you can simply pick your feed of choice from an open marketplace,"" ablog post on the sitesays. A longer post goes into more detail aboutcustom feeds and algorithmic choice. Click the hashtag icon on the bottom of the app to add and discover new feeds. Developers can use the site'sfeed generator starter kitto create a custom feed, and the site promises that eventually, the tools will be easy enough that the rest of us can build custom feeds. Want to jump right in to Bluesky by following a curated list of people? You can follow starter packs, which are lists created by users and usually themed. CNET has alengthy explanation here, but in short, they're similar to what X calls lists, and are a good way to get a solid feed going that caters to your interests.

360,Best Flip Phone for 2024,"What to Consider iOS or Android If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. Know that switching between the two has never been easier. Size Phones are big in general with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and large models topping out at 6.8 inches. That makes visiting a store and trying a phone out before you buy it quite important. Cameras Phone cameras have gotten better over the past five years. Don’t be fooled by how many cameras a phone has; more is not necessarily better. Software support Phone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features but also keep your phone secure. The latest iteration of flip phones with foldable screens has come a long way four years, improving in design, durability and features while dropping in price – the new Razr starts at just $700. These flip phones offer a modern twist on a classic design with large cover displays and the ability to run almost any Android app on the outer screen. They also pack great cameras and offer a regular phone experience in a foldable form. If you’re looking to hop on the flip phone wave, there are a lot of options to navigate. But we at CNET have tested and reviewed everything on this list to help you find the best flip phone for you. What to Consider iOS or Android If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. Know that switching between the two has never been easier. Size Phones are big in general with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and large models topping out at 6.8 inches.

Software support Phone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features but also keep your phone secure. The Motorola Razr Plus (2024) is CNET's top flip phone pick. It was a close call between it and Samsung's new and more expensive Galaxy Z Flip 6. There's a lot to enjoy in the Razr Plus, like the larger cover screen, which I found myself using a lot of the time, the long battery life, fast charging and improved cameras. The new model is certified to survive temporary dunking, with an IPX8 rating that means it can be immersed under 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. The 2024 Razr Plus is an absolute delight to use and will no doubt appeal to fans looking for something more unique and fashionable than the standard rectangular slabs offered by Apple and Samsung. When I consider theMotorola Razr Pluson its own terms, it's outstanding. And perhaps more importantly, it's a delight to use. The 4-inch cover screen makes the Razr feel like two phones in one. You can use pretty much any app on the outer display, as well as respond to messages, watch videos, make video calls and even play games -- all without opening up the Razr Plus. Add to that a long battery life, fast charging, improved cameras and an IPX8 rating that certifies that the Razr Plus will survive temporary dunking and you realize just how much value Motorola has poured into its flagship foldable. Its $1,000 price is steep, but you're getting one of the best clamshell style foldables you can buy. For better or worse,Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6foldable is packed with AI. It can take a rough sketch and turn it into artwork or help me have a conversation in French or Korean despite my only knowing a few words of either language. The new autofocus/autozoom feature lets you prop the phone in a half-open position and the Z Flip 6 will automatically zoom in or out (switching between the main and ultrawide cameras) to get a photo that best suits the moment. Samsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera; a smaller hinge and crease; a larger battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. But all this comes at a higher starting price: $1,099, which makes it hard to appreciate the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for the absolute great phone that it is. The2024 Motorola Razris an impressive example of a foldable phone that doesn't break the bank. Yes, you'll have to make some compromises when it comes to camera quality (shots aren't quite as remarkable as what you'll get on the -- pricier -- Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Motorola Razr Plus, for instance, and night mode isn't great), but you'll still generally get high-quality images on both the rear and internal cameras. The phone also has great battery life (it can last for over a day and a half), and that crease in the internal display is hardly noticeable when you're using your phone like usual; I could barely see it when watching videos or scrolling through photos and apps. The biggest selling point, though, is that 3.6-inch cover screen, which is convenient for quickly replying to a text, pulling up the camera and controlling your music. You can also take advantage of fun Moto features like gesture selfie, which automatically snaps your photo after you show your palm, and auto smile capture, which takes a picture when everyone in the frame is smiling. But the coolest feature, in my opinion, is External Display Preview mode, which shows a preview of the photo you're snapping using the cover screen. It's a prime example of how the 2024 Razr serves as a practical device that effectively utilizes both displays. TheGalaxy Z Flip 5was the biggest leap forward Samsung's flip phone had seen when it launched in 2023. Samsung significantly expanded the size of the cover screen located on the outside of the device, meaning you can look up directions, take photos and send messages without opening the phone. It's this, combined with the Z Flip's solid battery life and sturdy design, that makes it a top pick. The Z Flip 5 was our favorite flip phone in 2023, but there are still some drawbacks to be aware of. Not all apps work natively on the front screen as they do on the Motorola Razr Plus. At $1,000, it's still expensive for a phone without a telephoto camera. The newer Z Flip 6 costs even more. Though the Z Flip 5 can often be found on discount.Read our Galaxy Z Flip 5 review. In 2024, you can find the Motorola Razr Plus (2023) often discounted -- we've seen it as low as $600 which makes it a fantastic value. The Razr Plus raised the bar for what a flip phone should be when it released in 2023. The 3.6-inch cover screen allows you to use almost any app without opening the phone, plus battery life is long enough to get you through a busy day. It's also thinner than the Galaxy Z Flip 5, which could make it the ideal choice for those who prioritize portability in a phone. The Razr Plus (2023) is worth considering if you prefer a thinner design and want to use more apps on the phone's front screen without much extra fuss. The Razr Plus is a great choice for those who care about compactness above all else.Read our Motorola Razr Plus review. Don't discount the midrange:Features of last year's flagships always trickle down to this year's midrange handsets. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a premium phone can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 8 Pro packs a great zoom camera, but the base Pixel 8 has most of the same key specs and comes at a more reasonable price. If you're trying to save a few bucks, you shouldn't be considering a flip phone. Devices like the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Motorola Razr Plus are priced like high-end premium phones, although Motorola plans to release a cheaper Razr this year. Shop the sales:Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. Find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange. Last year's phones:They can often be a great deal, too. Wait for this year's launch to get last year's phone for less, when stores and carriers may be trying to offload their existing stock. Keep in mind you'll miss out on the spacious cover screens found on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Razr Plus by going for last year's models. Hold the phone in hand at a store first:You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person. This is especially important for flip phones and other foldable devices, particularly if it's your first time using one. Knowing when to upgrade your phone largely depends on the age and condition of your current device as well as your budget. It's also a good idea to plan your upgrades in line with new models launching, if possible. Samsung is also rumored to be working on a cheaper Galaxy Z Flip model that could cost around $400 to $500. That's according to a leak posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, by an account with the handle@Tech_Reve. T.M. Roh, the president and head of Samsung's mobile experience division,told CNETthat offering a foldable phone for less than $1,000 is still a major challenge. ""And given the materials cost today ... it is probably not going to be easy for us to offer a less than $1,000 foldable in the very near future,"" Roh said. ""But we will keep trying."" If there is a cheaper foldable phone in the works at Samsung, it could debut alongside the company's pricier models. Samsung also tends to launch cheaper A-series and FE-series phones separately from its flagship phones. Most companies typically release new products around the same time every year, although launch cycles aren't always annual. Here's when Samsung, Motorola and Oppo launched their flip phones in 2023/2024, which could provide a hint at when they may launch future models.  The Galaxy Z Flip 4 (left), Galaxy Z Flip 5 (center) and Motorola Razr Plus (right) We test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus. Below is our methodology for testing smartphones in general, which also applies to flip phones. Photography is a major focus for most phones, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in multiple settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as the revamped Action mode on the iPhone 15 line, or the Magic Editor photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 8 series. Taking a photo with the Galaxy Z Flip 5. Battery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but is sometimes added later in an update. We use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. We perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Readmore:How we test phones Yes, new foldable flip phones from Samsung, Motorola and Oppo support 5G networks. Samsung began offering 5G on its flip phone back in 2020 with the second edition of the Galaxy Z Flip, which launched in August of that year. Yes, but there are important compromises to consider. Foldable phones offer benefits you can't get with a regular phone, such as a larger screen that fits in your pocket more easily, and the ability to take hands-free photos without a tripod. These phones are also more fragile than your average smartphone since they have hinges, which enable them to fold, and not all are rated for dust resistance. They also have noticeable creases running across their internal displays. You can also usually find better cameras on nonfoldable phones. All of today's phones pack some kind of camera setup on the back, with most packing multiple ones like ultrawide or telephoto zooms. More expensive phones, like the iPhone 15 Pro, use larger image sensors, better-quality lenses and image stabilization that let in more light, capturing detailed images with beautiful colors in daylight and at night. Typically, the more you pay, the better quality you'll get, with the most advanced features being reserved for the most expensive flagships. Most smartphones -- even those at the top end -- should be able to deliver a full day of mixed use on a single charge. That means you should have a bit of juice left at the end of your day, but you should expect to give it a full charge when you plug it in next to your bed at night. Most phones tend to come with a minimum of 128GB of storage, which is a good amount for apps, games and locally stored music. It's important to think about what you'll be doing with your phone. If you want to download and play a lot of games, then consider opting for a higher-capacity version.","Motorola's Razr Plus (2024) is our top choice, but Samsung also has a worthwhile flip phone for 2024.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-flip-phone/,
361,Best Desktop Computer for 2024,"What to consider Price You can find a good PC tower from brands like Acer, Asus Dell or HP for between $500 and $600 that will prove useful for years for general use. Gamers will want to level up the configuration with more RAM and better graphics options and can expect to spend between $800 and $1,200 or higher if going for a bleeding-edge graphics card. Operating system Most desktops run Microsoft Windows while Apple’s iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktops feature Apple’s MacOS. There is also the odd Chromebox offering based on Google’s ChromeOS that's easier to use and usually cheaper than a Windows PC or Mac but can’t run Windows or Mac software. Processor Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows desktops, while Apple makes its own M2 and M3 chips for Macs. Generally, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better its performance will be. Graphics For Macs, Apple's M2 and M3 processors integrate the GPU, but Windows PCs offer two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). For more demanding graphics needs such as media editing and gaming, you'll need a higher-end Mac with an M2 Max or Ultra chip or a PC with a dGPU from Nvidia or AMD. Memory We highly recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. Storage You may still find a cheaper hard drive in a budget desktop and larger hard drives in gaming PCs, but faster solid-state drives (SSDs) have all but replaced hard drives. Get what you can afford, but we recommend a minimum of 512GB for a desktop for most users and 1TB or more for storing large media or game libraries. Display An all-in-one integrates the display with the computer’s components placed not in a tower or small-form-factor enclosure but behind the display or in its base. For the display, you'll want a large screen with good resolution, which usually ranges from a 24-inch, full HD screen to a 32-inch, 4K display. Desktop PCs still pass through the CNET Labs on occasion, but laptops occupy the majority of our editors' time and effort with CNET's hands-on reviews. Because we test far more laptops than desktop, some of our current desktop recommendations are based on previous versions that we tested and reviewed. We also have general PC configuration suggestions that we haven't specifically tested but are based on our experience with similarly configured computers. These guidelines should be helpful if you're looking for the best cost-value when customizing a PC to order. What to consider Price You can find a good PC tower from brands like Acer, Asus Dell or HP for between $500 and $600 that will prove useful for years for general use. Gamers will want to level up the configuration with more RAM and better graphics options and can expect to spend between $800 and $1,200 or higher if going for a bleeding-edge graphics card.

Display An all-in-one integrates the display with the computer’s components placed not in a tower or small-form-factor enclosure but behind the display or in its base. For the display, you'll want a large screen with good resolution, which usually ranges from a 24-inch, full HD screen to a 32-inch, 4K display. The best desktop for most people is Apple's new M4-based iMac. It integrates the display and offers everything you could want in an all-in-one. For a reasonable sum, the iMac provides a fantastic design centered on a high-resolution, 24-inch display powered by Apple's new M4 processor. Performance from Apple's latest silicon is, without a doubt, impressive on all counts. If you need more screen space than you'd get with a laptop, the 24-inch iMac gives you added room on which to work and play. Yet, with its compact design and power cable that magnetically pops into place, the iMac is easy to relocate from room to room. The computer is also available in seven fun colors with accessories to match. If you're looking for a traditional tower desktop or a small-form-factor PC instead of an all-in-one like the iMac, then keep reading because we also have recommendations for those. We'll update this best desktop computer list periodically. The 24-inch iMac is especially well-suited as a family computer or if you want something other than a laptop to easily move from room to room. It's small enough to squeeze into tighter spaces, like a kitchen nook, but big enough to spread out your work, kick back and stream a movie or do some casual gaming. With the recent update to Apple’s M4 processor, the iMac is a more capable machine, especially with its new minimum 16GB of RAM. It also supplies an improved Center Stage webcam. And if you plan to put it in a bright and sunny room, there’s an optional nano-texture glass option that reduces glare and reflections. The iMac starts at $1,299 for a configuration that features an M4 chip with an eight-core CPU and eight-core GPU along with a 16-core Neural Engine for runningApple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI features. It also includes Apple’s Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse, which are now USB-C. An upgraded M4 chip with two more CPU cores and two more GPU cores is available, and you can also choose to expand the memory and SSD capacity. SCORE The Mac Mini desktop is one of Apple's longest-standing product lines, dating back to 2005 (in a pre-Intel version), a year before the first MacBook. And starting at $599, it remains the least expensive way to get a MacOS computer by a large margin. Unlike Apple's MacBook Pro and Air laptops, or the iMac desktop, the Mini is designed to work behind the scenes, fitting into small spaces and pairing with your choice of display and input devices. The surprising thing about the M4 Mac Mini isn't that Apple made it smaller; it's how much smaller it is than its M2-powered predecessor and how it can still have a more powerful M4 Pro chip in it and stay cool. The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays. SCORE While we like all-in-ones for their convenience, they're not easy to upgrade, if they can be at all. Dell's XPS desktop is a traditional tower PC but is compact and quiet enough for a small workspace. We reviewed the previous version, and the current XPS 8960 model is similar and can be loaded with a 14th-gen Core i9 processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card, up to 32GB of memory and 4TB of storage (with room inside for more).  SCORE If you're dissatisfied with the lack of configuration options available for prebuilt gaming desktops, going with a custom builder is the best way to sate your appetite. The cost of a custom-configured system that's fully decked out might be too costly for PC users. Many people don't need everything maxed out, even for gaming, but you can get reasonable configurations for about half the price of the $5,000-plus system we tested. Origin PC builds good, solid systems. Unless you're looking for something dirt cheap, you'll be able to put together something you like at a price you can tolerate. Origin's Neuron series starts at around $2,000, and the high-end Genesis line begins at roughly double that. A pre-configured Origin Genesis 5000D, for example, costs $5,611 and features a Core i9-14900K, 64GB of RAM and GeForce RTX 4090 graphics. SCORE The Mac Pro has long been the top dog in Apple's computer lineup but starts at a whopping $6,999. By comparison, the mainstream Mac Studio is far more affordable, starting at a reasonable $1,999. The baseline Mac Studio model features Apple's M2 Max processor, 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The step-up $3,999 model bumps you up to the more powerful M2 Ultra chip while doubling the RAM and SSD capacity. Either model is essentially a Mac Mini on steroids, and for anyone who doesn't want to shell out for a Mac Pro, it's a great pick for running creative-centric Mac apps, including animation, graphics, video-editing and audio-editing software. Be aware, however, that the Mac Studio is expected to get an M4 update sometime next year.  SCORE The review process for desktops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. We test all desktops with a core set of benchmarks, includingPrimate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6,Cinebench R23,PCMark 10, a variety of3DMarkbenchmarks (whichever can run on the desktop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a desktop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks fromGuardians of the Galaxy,The Rift Breaker(CPU and GPU) andShadow of the Tomb Raider. For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price. The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our page onhow we test computers. You can find a good PC tower from brands like Acer, Asus, Dell or HP for between $500 and $600 that will prove useful for years for general use. The specs we'd suggest for a basic Windows 11 machine: Do you want to do some PC gaming, or do you spend time editing photos or videos? You'll want to level up the configuration with more RAM and better graphics options. Expect price points to be between $800 and $1,200 (or even higher) if you go for a more bleeding-edge video card. Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do basically the same things, but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. Most desktops run Microsoft Windows while Apple's iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktops feature Apple's MacOS. There is also the odd Chromebox offering based on Google's ChromeOS. A Chromebox is easier to use and usually cheaper than a Windows PC or Mac but can't run Windows or Mac software. The processor, aka the CPU, is the brain of a desktop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows desktops. Both offer a staggering selection of processors. You can head toIntel'sorAMD'ssites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Intel's current lineup is its 13th generation of Core chips, with 14th-gen processors expected in early 2024. AMD's current desktop processor is its Ryzen 7000 series. Generally speaking, though, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be. Apple makes its own chips for Macs, which makes things slightly more straightforward. The iMac and Mac Mini feature Apple's latest M4 processor. The Mac Studio features either an M2 Max or M2 Ultra, while the Mac Pro is based on the M2 Ultra. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance. The graphics processor (GPU) handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Macs, Apple's M series processors integrate the GPU. For Windows desktops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU. Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller desktops such as an all-in-one or SFF PC but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. In fact, there are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU. For power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU. Only two real companies make them: Nvidia and AMD, although Intel offers some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs. For memory, we highly recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. Some lower-end models supply only 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows experience. Tower PCs will usually have free internal slots for adding more sticks of RAM, but all-in-ones and SFF PCs may not. Even if they do, those DIMM slots could be difficult to access. You may still find a cheaper hard drive in a budget desktop and larger hard drives in gaming PCs, but faster solid-state drives (SSDs) have all but replaced hard drives. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper desktops typically have slower drives. If your PC has only 8GB of RAM, it may end up switching to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. Get what you can afford, but we recommend a minimum of 512GB for a desktop for most users. For storing large media or game libraries, we suggest 1TB or more. If you need to go with a smaller drive, you can usually add a second internal drive to a tower PC. For all-in-ones and SFF PCs, an external drive or cloud storage is usually the easier choice to bolster a small internal drive. An all-in-one integrates the display with the computer's components placed not in a tower or small-form-factor enclosure but behind the display or in its base. The trade-off for this space-saving, streamlined design is fewer options for upgrades. For the display, you'll want a large screen with good resolution. The sweet spots we'd suggest are: Outside of Prime Day andBlack Fridaysales, there are certain times of the year when you are more likely to find a good desktop deal, or the latest tech -- sometimes both. January is a good time to find a post-holiday deal, and January is also the month when new models with new components are usually announced at CES. There is generally a lead time before those new models are released. Most often they become available in the spring. In the spring months, you will not only find the latest desktops with the latest CPUs from Intel and AMD and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, but you can also find discounts on older models that are suddenly relegated to previous-gen status but are still far from being classified as outdated. The next month to keep an eye out for desktop deals is July, when retailers begin to offer back-to-school sales. Those sales will run through August and into September. This is not to say you can’t lock in a solid desktop deal on any given day of the year. The large manufacturers such as Dell, HP and Lenovo constantly rotate sales on their sites, and retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Newegg offer discounts weekly. Following the debut of the Mac Mini in 2005, Windows PC makers experimented with similarly tiny designs. In the wake of likable small models like the Acer Revo One and HP Pavilion Mini, we even saw (woefully underpowered) ""PC on a stick"" offerings starting in 2015, but interest seems to have ebbed since then. Outside of specialty vendors like Beelink, the best choices in this mini PC size are probably theIntel NUC(Next Unit of Computing), most of which are sold as hobbyist options, requiring some BYO additions like user-supplied storage, RAM and other components -- including the operating system. See more bare-bones Mini PCs at Newegg. If you're looking for basic computing (browsing the web, email, social media, YouTube and the like), the Chrome operating system is the most affordable route for home computing. This Google operating system effectively is little more than the Chrome web browser. That makes it easy for multiple users (only a Gmail address is needed to log in), and -- because there's no heavy operating system beyond the browser -- viruses aren't really an issue. Colloquially known as ""Chromeboxes"" (versus a ""Chromebook"" laptop), these systems don't have beefy CPUs, RAM or storage requirements. That said, if you need any software beyond browser-based web apps, or if you don't have excellent broadband, you'll want to stick with the Windows or Mac options above. Before you spend any money, check out the free version of the operating system known as ChromeOS Flex, which you can install on most old PCs (including running it from an attached USB drive). If that's not an option and you want to buy new, expect to pay between $200 and $500 for a Chrome-based desktop. The closer you get to that $500 price point, the more you should consider stepping up to a Chromebook laptop or a basic Windows tower (see above) for just a bit more.See Chromebox options at Newegg. No; Windows, Mac and ChromeOS aren't your only operating system options. Linux has a wide range of operating systems, many of which are effectively free. You can get PCs with Linux preinstalled, but the better, more affordable option is probably installing it (or dual-booting) on a used Windows PC.See Linux PC options at Newegg. You may have heard of a small computer that's no bigger than a paperback book and can be purchased for about $150. That's the Raspberry Pi, and it's 100% real and very cool, especially if you're a hobbyist looking to build your own Lego-style computer and install custom Linux operating systems. We just wouldn't recommend it as a primary computer if you're looking to run mainstream software.See the Raspberry Pi 4 kit at Amazon. We recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 512GB of solid-state storage. Content creators and gamers would benefit from doubling the RAM to 32GB and the SSD to 1TB. Demanding graphics apps and 3D games will run more smoothly with the added RAM, and the added storage capacity will allow you to store large graphics files and game files. On larger desktops, you usually have room to add more memory and additional storage drives, but that expansion room is less likely on an SFF PC or all-in-one.","These are CNET editors’ top picks for best desktop computers, including both Macs and Windows PCs, plus advice on what you should look for in your next desktop.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-desktop-computer/,
362,Best AV Receiver of 2024,"What to consider  Channels If you’re looking for a Dolby Atmos receiver, the minimum number of channels is seven --  which is written as either 7.1 or 5.1.2 channels). Power specs are mostly made up, but anything over 100 watts per channel in stereo is good. HDMI inputs All modern components use the universal HDMI standard and so you should choose a receiver that has as many of these inputs as possible. If you’re a gamer choose one which has HDMI 2.1 so it can transmit 4K/120Hz to a TV as well. Dolby Atmos capability Most receivers over $500 include Dolby Atmos capability, but you don’t need to buy height speakers straight away. You can always add them later. Wi-Fi music streaming Alongside Bluetooth, many models have onboard Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless music streaming. Standards to look for include Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast built-in. If you’re serious about bringing theater-like sound into your home then an AV receiver is the best choice. A modem receiver is a sophisticated device which fulfills two roles -- it acts as a TV video switch between components like a streaming box or gaming console,  and it decodes and amplifies audio signals so you can hear them on your speakers. The best receivers offer excellent sound quality and come equipped with 8K video,Dolby Atmosand music streaming capabilities, and they connect to your TV via HDMI. You can start with as little as a pair ofstereo speakersand add new speakers and a subwoofer as your budget allows. Which is the best AV receiver for you? What to consider  Channels If you’re looking for a Dolby Atmos receiver, the minimum number of channels is seven --  which is written as either 7.1 or 5.1.2 channels). Power specs are mostly made up, but anything over 100 watts per channel in stereo is good. HDMI inputs All modern components use the universal HDMI standard and so you should choose a receiver that has as many of these inputs as possible. If you’re a gamer choose one which has HDMI 2.1 so it can transmit 4K/120Hz to a TV as well. Dolby Atmos capability Most receivers over $500 include Dolby Atmos capability, but you don’t need to buy height speakers straight away. You can always add them later. Wi-Fi music streaming Alongside Bluetooth, many models have onboard Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless music streaming. Standards to look for include Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast built-in. The TX-NR6100 is the follow-up to my favorite receiver of the past few years, theOnkyo TX-NR696. Like its predecessor, the NR6100 offers great sound and a wealth of connectivity (including 4K/120Hz support for gaming consoles). Streaming options include Chromecast built-in, DTS Play-Fi, Spotify Connect, Sonos, AirPlay and Bluetooth. With a bit more power than theSony STR-AN1000and a keener price than any competitor, the Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver value under $1,000. SCORE Sony went away for a couple of years but came back better than ever with the STR-AN1000. This model offers all of the latest features including HDMI 2.1 (4K/120Hz) support. It includes ""works with Sonos"" certification, but the reason to buy it is that it's a solid performer, especially with video games. It also has one of the most sophisticated setup routines yet, so dialing in great sound is even easier. SCORE Onkyo's TX-RZ50 is a perfect step-up model for those looking to upgrade their home theater systems for a set of better-quality speakers or to add a turntable. Like its budget-oriented label mate, the TX-NR6100, it's stacked with features including the audiophile-level calibration called Dirac Live, as well as the best streaming suite offered in an AV receiver. On that point, being able to request songs directly from Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa is a real boon. What improvements does the $1,599 TX-RZ50 offer over the $679 TX-NR6100? Firstly, it offers double the number of 8K compatible inputs (six versus three) plus it boasts more power (120 watts versus 100 watts). It also has two-way Bluetooth for streaming as well as listening on wireless headphones. The TX-RZ50's performance was excellent whether listening to streamed music or watching a movie: I hadn't heard Dolby Atmos sound this convincing in a long time. The addition of Dirac Live adds its own complexities in setup -- please, only use theOnkyo Controller mobile appin combination with the supplied microphone -- but doing so rewards with a highly involving performance. Be aware that the Onkyo is often out of stock, but as an alternative, the Yamaha RX-A4 is even better with movies if you're looking specifically for a home theater receiver.  I'm a big fan of theYamaha RX-V6A, so I was curious to see what the step-up RX-A4A brings to the table. As it turns out, this Yamaha offers even better build quality and a huge, cinematic sound. Look through the fancy top grille and you'll see neatly packed components and a distinguished, stamped transformer. The system is capable of a beefy 110 watts per channel (stereo) and has seven HDMI ports for your connectivity needs. I tested the Yamaha A4A against the Onkyo RZ50 and the Denon X3700. The Yamaha's sound quality tended toward the cinematic rather than the musical, and it offered a big, roomy sound perfect for blockbusters orconspiracy thriller TV shows.What was surprising is that the onboard phono preamp was even better than the one on the rival Onkyo RZ50, so I can recommend the Yamaha for people who don't want a separate preamp for their turntable. The Yamaha is great as a home theater receiver but doesn't sound as good with music streaming. Still, as the Onkyo offers balanced performance across both, it's my current favorite. The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver for most needs If you're spending under $1,000, there are four main receivers to choose from -- the Sony STR-AN1000, theYamaha RX-V6A, theOnkyo TX-NR6100and the Denon AVR-970H. All offer excellent performance, so the short answer about which to buy is whichever is available for the lowest price. At the moment, that is either the Denon or the Onkyo, which are both on sale for under $600 as I type this. I especially recommend theOnkyo TX-NR6100for its combination of excellent performance and connectivity. The Onkyo offers easy setup, excellent usability, solid looks and useful features, including the best streaming suite alongside Sony. As an added plus, the Onkyo was never prone to the4K issue that plagued early versionsof the Yamaha RX-V6A. Meanwhile, the step-up Onkyo TX-RZ50 is an excellent receiver if you're looking for the next level of features and a performance bump over sub-$1,000 models. It offers an excellent, if slightly scary, calibration routine from Dirac Live and the best number of streaming features on the market. It sounds great with music and movies alike. Lastly, if it's home theater thrills you're after, the Yamaha RX-A4A offers crisp, dynamic sound and fantastic build quality for $1,300. AV receivers are notoriously complex, with reams of features and confusing technical specifications. (For example, what's 4K/120Hz anyway?) Yet, what are the things that really matter when buying a new model? I'm going to sum up the most important ones right here. With most TVs and set-top boxes supporting HDMI, you should buy a receiver that has as many of these HDMI input ports and outputs as possible. Front-mounted HDMI ports are kind of like an appendix -- unneeded because most users don't hot-plug HDMI devices -- making the number of rear inputs what's most important. (How else are you going to connect your Roku,Blu-ray player,Nintendo Switchand all your other devices?) The Onkyo TX-NR6100 and Denon AVR-S970H have six rear-mounted HDMI inputs, while the Yamaha RX-V6A goes one better with seven. If you want to connect two different displays -- a TV and a projector, for example -- all but the Yamaha offer a second HDMI output. You should also be sure you have an extra HDMI cable or two on hand -- these things are like the second sock of a pair as you can never find them when you need them. Most receivers in the $500-and-above price range includeDolby Atmoscapability andDTS:X, but the effect they have on your home theater movie-watching can be subtle, or in most movies, nonexistent. In other words, don't worry about missing out on these formats by not installing a taller speaker or two. Mounting your rear surround speakers high on the wall will get you halfway there in terms of quality, immersive sound. Most midrange receivers have onboard Wi-Fi network connectivity forwireless music streamingvia your speaker system. There are plenty of standards for wireless streaming services, but the most universal areSpotify Connect, AppleAirPlayand Google Chromecast built-in/Google Cast. If you're looking to build a multiroom system with a variety of AV systems and speakers with wireless connectivity, these are the three flavors to aim for. Onkyo and Sony are the only devices to support all three. The Denon receiver model lacks wireless streaming via Google but ups the ante toAirPlay 2and the proprietary HEOS system. Meanwhile, Yamaha has its own MusicCast system. At CNET, I test audio equipment from compact soundbars to surround sound systems, but regardless of the device, my methodology is essentially the same. I always compare products against one or more reference devices that offer the best performance at a similar price. When it comes to receivers I want to see how well a system performs with music and movies, as most people will want to do both. I watch some test scenes from4K Blu-rayor streamed from a 4K streaming service (Vudu, for example) and evaluate aspects such as Dolby Atmos surround sound performance and dialog clarity. I also use severaltest music tracksand evaluate streaming features such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Systems that can perform well with both types of entertainment inevitably score the highest. Check out CNET'sreceiver buying guidefor more about the features and things you should consider when looking for a new system. Yamaha RX-V6A Yamaha RX-V6A($600, save $150): This Yamaha RX-V6A offers a fresh look at AV receiver design, with its futuristic edges and simple controls, while maximizing sound quality. The Yamaha might even make you forget about visiting a cinema ever again, and it's no slouch with music, either. It offers plenty of connectivity with Wi-Fi bringing AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth and Yamaha's MusicCast system for streaming from your devices. Notably, the TSR-700 is identical -- it's an exclusive model for some outlets -- and you can find refurbished for$400 here at Amazon.Find out more inCNET's Yamaha RX-V6A review. Marantz SR6015($1,499, save $1,000): The Marantz SR6015 does everything you'd expect -- Dolby Atmos, music streaming, 4K/120Hz throughput -- and with a good deal of aplomb. It sounds great, but it's not as flexible as the best receivers here -- for instance, you can't watch a video source while listening to music, like the Onkyos can, and neither can you ask aGoogle Nesttoplay a song on it. The Marantz SR6015 has beenreplaced by the Cinema 500, but the original is currently selling out for $1,000 less than its retail price. Denon AVR-X3800($1,572, save $127) Denon has long been one of the top AV receiver brands due to a reputation for quality sound and powerful amplification, and the AVR-X3800 will be able to power most systems with ease. In terms of features, the Denon has everything you need in a modern receiver including Dolby Atmos and six 8K HDMI inputs. Based on my head-to-head testing, I found that the Denon was even-handed with movies and music, but not as good as the Marantz SR6015 with music (above) or as good at home theater as my current pick, the Onkyo RZ50. ReadCNET's first take on the Denon AVR-X3800. A stereo receiver is an audio-only, two-channel amplifier that includes source switching and an AM/FM tuner -- if it lacks a tuner it's called an integrated amp. Meanwhile, an AV receiver is typically a surround sound system amplifier that enables HDMI switching and playback of audio and video. Most also include tuners onboard as well. An AV receiver is more versatile than a two-channel model because it can be used for both stereo and surround sound. You can add as many speakers to them as you have, starting at just two -- so they're pretty flexible to build out your surround sound system. Standards change all the time, but the bare minimum right now is support for HDR and Dolby Vision, and at least HDMI version 2.0 or better. All of the models above support not only 4K and HDR video but 8K support as well, even if 8K content is hard to find. Be aware that all 2020 8K-compatible receivers were prone to a bug preventing them from displaying variable refresh rate video, and from the Xbox Series X in particular. Denon, Marantz and Yamaha announced fixes for existing models, while compliant models from Yamaha RX-V6A began shipping in the summer of 2021.Denon and Marantz receivers sold after April 2021 should be 4K/120Hz compatible.Yamaha users can check for 4K compatibility herewhile Denon and Marantz users should check with their dealer. The TX-NR6100 is the first receiver I tested that I found to both pass 4K/120Hz and which I would also recommend to new buyers. If you have a relatively new TV you should be able to use a single cable -- an HDMI cable, to be exact -- to connect your receiver to your television. If you have an HDMI port labeledARC/eARCon the TV you can connect that to the mainHDMI ARCoutput of the receiver. Doing so enables you to hearonboard Netflix from your TVwhen you set the receiver on the ""TV"" input, while also enabling video to be transmitted from your other AV sources. If you have an older TV without an ARC-compliant port you will need to connect both an HDMI cable and an optical cable to the back of your TV. However, if you have a CRT or rear-projection TV which has composite or component inputs you will need a $1,000-plus receiver such as the Marantz SR6015 or Onkyo TX-RZ50. Many receivers no longer offer switching for these legacy connections. The short answer is: Yes, but only if you own an Xbox Series X and a brand-new TV. As I write this, there is agrowing number of Xbox Series X gamesthat support this optional mode -- including Halo Infinite and Fortnite, to name a couple -- but the advantages of 4K/120Hz over 60Hz are minimal as far as I've seen at this point. Future games and even video sources may make the differences clearer, and that's why you may want a receiver that's fully compatible. If you do buy an older receiver, you don't care about the Xbox Series X, you can always hook a fancy new console directly to the TV, then use eARC to get audio to the receiver. The rear panel of the TX-NR6100 offers 6 HDMI inputs and 2 outputs","Check out our picks for the best AV receivers from Onkyo, Sony, Yamaha, Denon and Marantz.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-av-receiver/,
363,Best Wireless Earbuds of 2024,"What to consider Budget Determine how much you're willing to spend on wireless earbuds and how that lines up with quality and functionality. Fit Your earbuds should offer a comfortable, secure fit. The seal will determine how noise-isolating they are, so keep an eye out for how tight of a seal they provide.

Durability You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. Features Premium wireless earbuds should offer best-in-class noise cancelling as well as have great microphones for phone calls. vs   I've been testing earbuds for almost 20 years and have reviewed hundreds of wired and wireless buds with a variety of designs. Today the category is dominated by true-wireless earbuds, many of which haveactive noise canceling-- or ""noisecancelling""(with a double L), as Bose and Google like to spell it. With so many great buds on the market, it's impossible to declare one model the best overall. A few models stand out, so they're near the top of this list. These include theApple AirPods Pro 2USB-C,Sony WF-1000XM5andBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, while the latest additions to the list are theJBL Live Beam 3andBeyerdynamic Amiron 300. What to consider Budget Determine how much you're willing to spend on wireless earbuds and how that lines up with quality and functionality. Fit Your earbuds should offer a comfortable, secure fit. The seal will determine how noise-isolating they are, so keep an eye out for how tight of a seal they provide. Return policy In case the earbuds aren't a great fit for your ears, it's important that the retailer offers a good return policy. Durability You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. Features Premium wireless earbuds should offer best-in-class noise cancelling as well as have great microphones for phone calls. When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles: They're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-cancelling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise cancelling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. And at $300 — $20 more than their predecessor — they're costly, too. But overall they're really impressive, easily among the very top earbuds on the market. SCORE Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Pro. Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. Also, check out all the Airpods fromApple on sale this Amazon Prime Day. SCORE If you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features. Ultimately, however, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it. SCORE Earfun is one of our go-to brands for value earbuds. ItsAir Pro 4 budsaren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Input codeEAP4CNETat checkout on Amazon to get an extra 10% off). Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs. Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much. As I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio). I do think the voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. SCORE Nothing has changed with Nothing's latest $149 Ear noise-canceling earbuds. At least, not at first glance. You'd be forgiven if you thought the buds had taken a step back; while they're the successor to Nothing's Ear (2) earbuds they don't have a 3 anywhere in their name. Nor do they employ Apple's generational naming scheme. They're just the Nothing Ear, and they look the same as the Ear (2). Some changes on the inside deliver legitimate improvements, particularly to sound quality, noise canceling and battery life. If you can't quite afford this model, Nothing also has the new $99 Ear (a), which comes in a new yellow color as well as white and black. It has different drivers and includes a smaller charging case (it has a lower IPX2 water-resistance rating and leaves off wireless charging), but otherwise has very similar features and may be a slightly better value. But the flagship Ear does sound slightly better. SCORE While the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. And a natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit. SCORE There's been some hype recently around solid-state semiconductor Micro-Electromechanical Systems, aka MEMS, speakers and you can findxMEMS driversin Creative Labs' Aurvana Ace ($130) and Ace 2 earbuds ($150). The newer Ace 2 has support for Qualcomm's AptX Lossless for the limited number of devices that support that audio codec but otherwise the two models seem nearly identical, except for their color schemes. While the Ace 2 is missing features like ear-detection sensors that are often found in buds in this price range, they do sound quite impressive (if you get a tight seal), with nicely detailed, accurate sound and well-defined bass that has some warmth to it (it does help to play around with the companion app's equalizer settings to optimize the sound to your liking). I found their adaptive noise canceling good, though not necessarily great. The same was true for the voice-calling performance. Overall the true wireless earbuds are well-designed and have some eye-catching design elements that help them stand out from other earbuds with stems. They're IPX5 splash-resistant, are rated for up to 6 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels and offer wireless charging. For their price, they deliver good bang for your buck, particularly when it comes to sound quality. The concept behind the Fit Pro is pretty simple. Take Beats iconicPowerbeats Prosport earbuds with its big ear hook and shrink it down. I can't say I ever loved the Powerbeats Pro's design but a lot of people do because the ear hook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head. I personally prefer my sport earbuds to have a wingtip that fits into the inside of your ear rather than wrap around the outside of it. And that's what we have here. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensiveStudio Budsand 2023Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of theAirPods Pro'sfeatures, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. SCORE Google's redesigned itsPixel Buds Pro 2to fit more ears better. Not only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new ""hands-free, eyes-free"" Gemini virtual AI assistant. So long as you get a snug fit and tight seal (yes, that's critical for sound quality and noise-canceling performance), these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. SCORE I thought Beyerdynamic's first pair of true-wireless earbuds, the Free Byrd, sounded impressive. But they were a little bulky and their design left something to be desired. That isn't the case for its new-for-2024 Amiron 300 buds. They're compact, lightweight and fit my ears well -- I was able to get a tight seal with the largest ear tip. While their noise canceling falls short of what you get with flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Sony, Bose and Apple -- it's decent enough but not great -- the Amiron 300's sound is rich, detailed and fairly open (you can can distinctly hear each instrument). The have a pleasant tonal balance, and you can tweak their EQ settings in Beyerdynamic's companion app. The bass is articulate and punchy and there's nice clarity and accuracy to the midrange (where voices live). The buds support the SBC, AAC and LDAC audio codecs and have some of the key features you'd expect from premium earbuds. These include ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear and resume playback when you put it back in, wireless charging, transparency and low-latency modes and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3). I thought their touch controls worked well and battery life was solid -- they're rated for up to 7 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and up to 10 hours with it off. They have three microphones in each bud and callers said they could hear me well even in noisy environments with only a bit of background noise intruding. Jabra bills the Elite 8 Active as the ""world's toughest earbuds,"" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original, but it includes an LE Audio smart case, allowing wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port (I tested it with an inflight entertainment and it worked well, with no audio lag). The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio ""for a better music experience,"" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors, and improved noise-cancelling performance that make for great sport earbuds. With this Gen 2 upgrade to its Elite 8 Active and its semi-open Elite 10 buds, Jabra seems to have once again hit its stride with its earbuds line. Alas, Jabra's parent company, GN, recently announced that it's decided togradually wind down the Jabra Elite product line. While Jabra will continue to support its Elite buds for the foreseeable future, buyers should be aware of this development. Until then, make sure you enjoy some of the best true wireless earbuds on the market. SCORE Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. The transparent version is getting a lot of attention (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' ""acoustic architecture"" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds. SCORE You should expect a lot from earbuds that cost $300 -- and yes, that's still a lot to pay for headphones, even if plenty of people seem to be willing to pay upwards of $450 for the likes of Apple's AirPods Max headphones. Overall, Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, very good noise canceling and a robust feature set. Voice-calling capabilities are decent but don't quite live up to their billing (yet). Hopefully, we'll see some firmware upgrades that improve the voice-calling experience in noisier environments. Despite that caveat, as long as they fit your ears well, the Technics EAH-AZ80 are right up there with the best wireless earbuds on the market right now. SCORE The Live Beam 3 earbuds look similar to the earlierLive Buds Pro 2, which I like a lot, especially when they go on sale for less than $100. The Live Beam 3 buds are essentially JBL's AirPods Pro 2 competitor, and their distinguishing feature is the 1.45-inch touchscreen LCD integrated into their charging case, which acts as a remote control for the buds and lets you access their other features. Equipped with 10mm drivers, not only do they offer clear, well-defined sound with punchy bass, but their noise canceling and voice-calling performance is also very solid. Their battery is good too -- they offer up to 10 hours of battery life with ANC on and 12 hours with it off, at moderate volume levels (a 10-minute charge gives you four hours of battery life). Available in four color options, they're IP55 splash-proof and dust-resistant. Note that JBL's flagship Tour Pro 3 earbuds also have an integrated LCD, but they feature dual drivers, which deliver even better sound than these buds, with a little more depth and detail. However, the Live Beam 3 often sell for $50 off their $200 list price, which makes them a better deal overall. If you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about withSamsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Yes, the noise cancellation might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step-up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. SCORE Whenever a new pair of Momentum True Wireless earbuds drops, I always find myself saying, ""Wow, these sound good."" Sound quality has always been the MTW's biggest strength, and that remains the case with the fourth-gen version. There's been some modest improvements in other areas, particularly with the noise cancellation performance and the reliable, hiccup-free Bluetooth connection I had with my phone. At the same time, the voice-calling performance could be better, and I'm a little disappointed that these aren't even more of an upgrade over their predecessor. Still, the Momentum True Wireless 4 are excellent true wireless earbuds that I have no problem recommending. SCORE The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. They're still true wireless earbuds, and at $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds. SCORE Simply put, the Pi8s are fantastic-sounding earbuds that also benefit from having a clearly improved design from the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2. It's debatable whether the Pi8s sound $150 better than the step-down Pi6s (they're also new for 2024), but there's no doubt these are some of the best-sounding earbuds on the market, if not the best (everybody's sound tastes vary so it's hard to declare one set of buds the best-sounding overall). Like with the Pi7 S2, sound quality is the highlight here, along with the charging case's ability to transform into a Bluetooth transceiver. Noise cancellation seems improved, and noise reduction during calls seems better, but the voice-calling performance wasn't as good as what I got with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Truth be told, in some ways, I like the Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than itsflagship WF-1000XM5noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls.Read our hands-on first take. Released in 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than 2022's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splash-proof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise cancellation and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging. There are no discounts on these headphones right now, but the Anker Soundcore C30i clip-on headphones cost $70. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new true wireless earbuds. Budget-friendly earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" buds for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for premium buds from Sony, Apple or Bose, be prepared to spend a lot more. It's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise cancelling can be dramatically impacted for the worse. Open earbuds don't have that issue, but they should be comfortable to wear and sit securely in your ears. You want earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important with true wireless earbuds, which are more susceptible to loss or damage due to their size. You want the best-sounding headphones with the best sound modes, , call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. Because the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds aren't a good match for your ears. We test true wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,features,voice-calling performanceandvalue. Our reviewer David Carnoy testing voice-calling performance on the noisy streets of New York. Master & Dynamic MW09: Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship true wireless earbuds ($349) look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to noise cancellation. The earbuds sound great but are mysteriously out of stock everywhere, so we dropped them from the best list. If they come back in stock, we'll add them back to this list. Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes the Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for relatively inexpensive open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound (they're a little more behind the AirPods 4, which offer improved sound from the AirPods 3). On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof. (Apply the codeWINGS2AIat checkout to get an additional 13% off). Sennheiser CX: If you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds, the CX are a good alternative. They feature very good sound, plus decent noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. The only issue is they stick out of your ears a bit and may not fit some smaller ears. This model, which often sells for less than $100 on Amazon, doesn't feature active noise cancellation but the step-up CX Plus does (theCX Plusis also a good value, particularly when it goes on sale). Beats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio Buds look a lot like the rumored stemless AirPods some people have been waiting for. Geared toward both iOS and Android users, they are missing a few key features on the Apple side of things (there's no H1 or W1 chip), but they're small, lightweight true wireless earbuds that are comfortable to wear and offer really good sound. Their noise cancellation isn't as good as the AirPods Pro's, but they do have a transparency mode and they're decent for making calls.Read our Beats Studio Buds review. JBL Live Free 2: Like theLive Pro 2, JBL's new Live Free 2 buds are surprisingly good. With 11mm drivers, six microphones, oval tubes and oval silicon tips, they combine a comfortable fit along with strong noise cancellation, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance. Features include multipoint Bluetooth pairing and wireless charging, and they're rated for up to seven hours with IPX5 water resistance (splash-proof). Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise cancellation along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. Their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices.Read our full review. JBL Tour Pro 2: JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds have received a lot of attention for bringing something new to true wireless earbuds: a full color touchscreen display embedded in the case that allows you to access the earbuds' key features and control playback as well as adjust volume levels. It's a bit of a gimmick but also useful. While the buds could sound slightly better for their list price, overall the JBL Tour Pro 2s are very good earbuds that offer a good fit, a robust feature set, strong battery life, plus solid noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. Sony LinkBuds S: Unlike the ""open"" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating true wireless earbuds with tips that jam in your ears. They're more compact and lighter than Sony's former flagship WF-1000XM4 and also feature Sony's V1 processor (Sony has since released the more compact WF-1000XM5). While their sound and noise cancellation don't quite measure up to either XM4 or XM5's, they're still quite good. They're the Sony buds for people who can't afford Sony's flagship earbuds but want 80% of those buds' features and performance for significantly less. Read more about them in ourhands-on review of the Sony LinkBuds S. Sony WF-1000XM4: Released in 2021, Sony's WF-1000XM4 earned a CNET Editors' Choice Award. They're still excellent earbuds, but Sony has now released the next-gen WF-1000XM5. They may be a good option if you find them at a good discount. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 were among the best new true wireless earbuds of 2022. They're still among the best truly wireless earbuds, but Sennheiser has released the upgraded Momentum True Wireless 4. Also, the newer AirPods Pro 2 and Sony WF-1000XM5 buds are arguably superior, so only look to buy the Momentum True Wireless 3 when they're significantly discounted. Beyerdynamic Free Byrd: Beyerdynamic may be late to the game, but it's finally introduced its first true wireless earbuds, which feature active noise cancellation, up to 11 hours of battery life (with noise cancelling off) and impressive sound quality.Read our Beyerdynamic Free Byrd review. Master & Dynamic MW08: These buds may not fit everyone's ear equally well, but they certainly have a distinct look, as well as excellent sound and a great listening experience if you can get a tight seal (I was able to get a secure fit with the largest tip). They deliver more of an audiophile sound profile, with smooth, well-balanced sound and well-defined bass. Status Between 3ANC: Status earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you are getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise cancelling true wireless earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, although they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise cancelling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me. Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX: Bang & Olufsen's $399 Beoplay EX buds are the company's best true wireless earbuds. They feature a comfortable, secure fit (except perhaps for those with really smaller ears), top-notch build quality, great sound, good noise cancellation and improved voice-calling performance over B&O's EQ buds, with three microphones in each earbud they help with reducing background noise while picking up your voice. They're out of most people's price range, but they're arguably the best earbuds out there with stems and offer slightly superior sound to the AirPods Pro 2 with better clarity, deeper more powerful bass and richer, more accurate sound. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's newLive Pro 2andLive Free 2buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise cancellation, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. Sony Linkbuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple'sstandard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the Linkbuds S noise-isolating earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about.Read our Sony Linkbuds review. Amazon Echo Buds 2023: The 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that ofApple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). The AirPods 3 cost around $150 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or ""semi-open"" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale for $35. With true wireless earbuds, you should get the right fit so they not only stay in your ears but so they sound and perform at their best (a tight seal is crucial for optimal sound and noise cancellation if the earbuds have active noise cancelling). If the buds come with silicone ear tips, you should use a bud that's a little bigger rather than too small for your ear. Also, in some cases, like with the AirPods Pro, you can buy third-party foam ear tips that grip the inside of your ear better and keep your buds from falling out. Note that sometimes people have one ear shaped differently than the other, so you might use a medium tip in one ear and a large tip in the other. AirPods have never fit all ears equally well, and a lot of people complain that they won't stay securely in their ears. You can buy third-party wingtips -- sometimes called sport fins -- that lock the buds in your ears. You have to take them off every time you use your buds because they won't fit in the case. If you have trouble keeping true wireless earbuds in your ears, your best bet is to look for a sport earbuds model that includes wingtips or actually integrates them into the buds' design. You can also get earbuds that have ear hooks that wrap around the top of your ears. Several sports buds feature this design. It can be particularly appealing to bikers who can't afford to have their earbuds drop out of their ears while riding at high speed. Before earbuds like the AirPods came along, wireless earbuds had a cord between the buds. They were wireless because they offered wireless Bluetooth streaming and didn't have a headphone cable that plugged into your device. Some companies still make those types of wireless earbuds -- theBeats Flexis one example -- and some people like having a cord that allows the buds to dangle from your neck when not in use. True wireless earbuds, like the AirPods, have no cord between them. They are entirely cord-free and link wirelessly to create a stereo pair. They are sometimes referred to by the acronym TWS, which stands for true wireless stereo. We havean article on how to clean your AirPodsthat also applies to other earbuds. If you don't want to read that, the condensed version is this: Wipe down both the buds themselves and ear tips with a slightly dampened soft, dry, lint-free cloth (like the kind you use to clean glasses or your phone's screen) and avoid using any soap or harsh cleaning liquids. A 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or a Clorox disinfecting wipe is OK but avoid getting too much moisture in any ports or inside the buds themself. You can also use a toothpick for any little crevices or a Q-tip with a bit of alcohol on it. Avoid saturating the Q-tip with alcohol. Finally, wait a few minutes until any moisture evaporates before using the buds. If you have true wireless earbuds, you can stop here. However, those with regular wireless earbuds should be sure to wipe down any other parts of the earbuds, including the cords or neck strap. In recent months there have been a bunch of articles about how Gen Z is making the ""humble"" wired headphones cool again, particularly Apple EarPods (you know, the headphones that used to be included in the box when bought an iPhone but no longer are). That's fine -- and we have nothing against wired headphones -- but a cord can be a nuisance. When you're working out or running, going totally wireless with sport earbuds feels liberating. Also, most new phones these days don't have a headphone jack so you need to go wireless unless you get a Lightning or USB-C headphone or use an adapter for a standard headphone with a 3.5mm plug. You can get wireless headphones with a cord between the buds. Neckband-style earbuds are still a thing and some people like that style because you can let the cord dangle around your neck when you don't have the buds in your ears. However, true wireless earbuds ultimately offer more freedom and are stored in a compact charging case that's convenient to carry. Both the sound quality and reliability of their true wireless connection have improved considerably over the last couple of years. As far as prices go, while you can certainly find plenty of premium true wireless earbuds, there are also lots of decent affordable models, some of which cost less than $50. A battery life rating of five hours is considered adequate but many of the latest true wireless earbuds offer six hours or more of battery life with noise cancelling on. Battery life increases if you don't use noise cancellation. Some true wireless earbuds now deliver over 10 hours of battery life with noise cancelling off.","These are the best wireless Bluetooth earbuds that CNET editors have tested, including top models from Apple, Beats, Bose, Samsung and others.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-wireless-earbuds/,
364,The Apple Watch 10 Is All In on Snorkeling. I Took It for a Swim,"As my shadow drifted toward it, the burgundy octopus retreated under a rock, sucking itself into a dark crevasse. While I floated, peering down through my dive mask, a wave splashed over the back of my head and I realized I'd lost track of time once again while communing with the sea life off Maui's south shore. I turned my face to check my Apple Watch and it told me I'd been in the water for almost 30 minutes without a break. In the past, I'd have needed anApple Watch Ultrato make use of the Oceanic Plus app, which was designed for tracking scuba sessions —my colleague Jesse Orrall explored that feature back in 2022. Then this fall theApple Watch Series 10arrived, and with it, compatibility with Oceanic Plus, including an update geared for snorkeling. Shortly after the Series 10 was released, I was due to head to the snorkeling hotspot of Hawaii, so I knew I had to take it for a spin. As hobbies go, snorkeling isn't one I indulge in frequently, because my nearest opportunity is the frigid North Sea. Brushing up against the shorelines of Scotland, Norway and other Northern European countries, the North Sea is neither the most alluring nor the most interesting body of water in which to submerge your face. But I've been fortunate over the years to snorkel in some fantastic locations, making it one of my favorite vacation activities. I've swum with turtles in Indonesia and with rays, sharks and dolphins in Australia, and I've explored the most dazzling technicolor coral gardens in the Red Sea. Maui is well known for its sea turtles. During my trip to Hawaii, snorkeling was pretty much the primary focus of my beach time. As usual I had my mask and snorkel with me, as well as a GoPro for filming the giant green sea turtles that Maui is famous for. I also had a small dry bag to keep my valuables in, which I clipped around my waist, and on my wrist was the Apple Watch Series 10. Ever since the first Apple Watch launched, 10 years ago, I've advocated for the gadget as a travel tool. The ease of glancing down at your travel details when you have your hands full; the ability to keep a close eye on activity and sleep as you shift across time zones; and just remaining connected while you're on the move mean that it really comes into its own when you're headed on vacation or a business trip. Along with my phone, headphones, GoPro and Kindle, it's a key piece of tech I can't imagine traveling without these days. See also:I Wore the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 for a Month. This One's My Favorite The Series 10 has a ""swim-proof"" design with a water resistance rating of 50 meters. The watch detects when it's been submerged, which triggers the water lock. When you emerge from the water, you can hold down the digital crown to expel the water from the grilles on either side of the watch. Also new for this iteration of the Apple Watch is a depth sensor app that tells you the water temperature and times how long you remain underwater. Combined with the Apple Watch tides app, it's pretty much ready to go snorkeling straight out of the box. For people who take their snorkeling a little more seriously, the Oceanic Plus app is an additional investment at $2/£2 per month. For that, you get a GPS activity map of every snorkeling session and a log book, which will automatically import any photos or videos from your iPhone, with color correction. Even before I entered the water, the Oceanic Plus app was helpful in guiding me to popular snorkeling spots with the assistance of its heat map. I also used the built-in tides app on the Apple Watch to understand more about the sea conditions before beginning a snorkeling session. The Apple Watch can help you understand ocean conditions. As I submerged the watch, and myself, in the sea, the water lock would activate and I could either start up the Oceanic Plus app, or the free Apple Watch Depth app would pop up on the watch face. Both would start a timer and inform me of how deep I was (not very; I was snorkeling after all), as well as the temperature of the water. The timer was perhaps the most useful aspect of snorkeling with the Apple Watch. It's very easy to lose track of time when you're snorkeling, and the timer let me keep an eye on how long I'd been swimming and helped me stay aware of the sea conditions. As I swam, the Oceanic Plus app gathered data about my distance and route, in the background. When I got back to shore — after holding down the digital crown to send salty liquid fizzing out of my Apple Watch — I could add to my logbook extra details for future reference, about the visibility, surface condition and current, as well as notes about what fish I'd seen (with a little help from the app's Ocean ID feature). Because I had a GoPro with me, I wasn't using my iPhone to take photos or videos during my snorkeling session. If I had, they would've been automatically incorporated into my snorkel log by virtue of their timestamps. I enjoyed and appreciated the added data that I gained from snorkeling with the Apple Watch, but I found the simple built-in Depth app to be the most useful feature. The Oceanic Plus app proved handy when looking back on each swim, and for creating a record of what I'd seen where. When people asked me where I'd seen the turtles, for instance, I was able not just to describe or vaguely point out the spots in my maps app, but also show them the exact route I swam. If I'm ever fortunate enough to return to Maui, I'll look forward to revisiting some of the spots where I saw the most exciting sea life and comparing and contrasting the results. My eight-legged friend. There's no doubt I'd get more out of the Oceanic Plus app if I was snorkeling regularly. If I lived near a decent snorkel spot, I'd enjoy tracking the different fish and creatures I saw at different times and using the trend data to learn about their behavior and deepen my connection with my local underwater ecosystem. For a casual snorkeler on vacation, I wouldn't declare the Apple Watch an essential accessory. As Jesse pointed out in his diving test with the Apple Watch Ultra, the Oceanic Plus app really shines when you use it for scuba rather than snorkeling — and that remains true even with improvements to the snorkeling features. That said, it's great to know that if you do own an Apple Watch Series 10, or an Ultra model, it's wearable and usable for snorkeling. The Oceanic Plus snorkeling subscription is eminently affordable, but if you're like most people, the built-in Depth app feature on the Apple Watch will provide the perfect amount of easily accessible, real-time data while you're cruising the coral in search of fishy friends.","I've got gizmos and gadgets aplenty, but under the sea none compare to this one.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-apple-watch-10-is-all-in-on-snorkeling-i-took-it-for-a-swim/,

366,Best Smartwatch for 2024,"What to Consider iPhone or Android Most smartwatches only work with one platform. The Apple Watch will only work with an iPhone, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch only pair with Android phones, for example. Garmin and Fitbit are the two major brands that currently offer smartwatches that work with both Android and iPhone. Size and design Smartwatches reflect your personal style and come in a variety of finishes, from aluminum to titanium, with a seemingly endless variety of watch bands to choose from. There's also a watch size and design to suit every wrist, so you'll want to ask yourself if you prefer a round screen for that classic wristwatch look or a square display like the Apple Watch. It's best to try in-store before you buy. Health and fitness features Smartwatches have become the de-facto way to measure activity from your wrist and can encourage you to get moving. It's increasingly common for them to offer health features like a blood oxygen sensor. Some may even have an ECG (also known as an electrocardiogram) which can check for signs of a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Once niche, clunky gadgets, smartwatches have transformed into must-have accessories that blend style, comfort and an array of smart features. Whether Apple or Android, you're sure to find a smartwatch that fits your lifestyle and budget. If your needs are basic – think exercise, notifications and sleep – most smartwatches will do. But for those who want more advanced tracking, premium models with polished software and health tools like blood pressure and sleep apnea monitoring may be the way to go. After a decade of reviews, I can confirm they're well worth it today. If you’re looking to make the investment, here are our top picks for the best smartwatches. What to Consider iPhone or Android Most smartwatches only work with one platform. The Apple Watch will only work with an iPhone, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch only pair with Android phones, for example. Garmin and Fitbit are the two major brands that currently offer smartwatches that work with both Android and iPhone.

It's increasingly common for them to offer health features like a blood oxygen sensor. Some may even have an ECG (also known as an electrocardiogram) which can check for signs of a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. TheApple Watch Series 10is our favorite overall smartwatch. It combines polished software with a wide variety of health tools and smartphone companion features. Ten years after the original Apple Watch set the stage for the modern smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 10 adds even more health-tracking features including sleep apnea notifications and practical smartwatch tools like voice isolation for clearer calls. If you’re an iPhone owner, the Series 10 provides the right balance of features for the price. The Apple Watch Series 10 isn’t perfect. Battery life still only lasts about one to two days with light use. Fast charging goes some way to address battery life, but it still means the watch is off your wrist more than you might like. Considering the health and safety tools, from fall detection during the day, to sleep apnea notifications at night, you are likely to want to wear the watch as much as possible. The Apple Watch Series 10 has the right balance of health tracking and everyday usability to make it the best choice.  The Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch's tenth birthday. It is slimmer and lighter than earlier Apple Watches, with two new case sizes: 42-millimeter or 46-millimeter. The wide-angle OLED screens make the watch brighter when looking at it off-axis. The LTPO3 technology also brings a ticking second hand to the always-on display. The Apple Watch Series 10 also comes with sleep apnea notifications, which can detect signs of this potentially dangerous condition over 30 days. Battery life is still rated for 18 hours, though you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use. The Apple Watch Series 10 now has even faster charging though, which makes up for the battery life somewhat, able to charge to 80% in 30 minutes. Overall, it's an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners. Google's Pixel Watch 3 offers one of the most elegant round-screen designs you'll see on a smartwatch and now comes in two size options to suit more wrists. It also comes with a range of new tools, including AI-generated running workouts, the Morning Brief digest, and more applications for the Daily Readiness Score. The Pixel Watch 3 is still missing some features you might expect on a Google-branded smartwatch, including Gemini support. Overall, if you're a runner and want more robust smartwatch features than on a traditional running watch, the Pixel Watch 3 won't disappoint. The Garmin Venu 3’s stellar battery life, a wide selection of health tracking features and workout types and comprehensive wellness metrics make it a top choice. The battery life alone is enough to make the Garmin Venu 3 stand out, with it lasting for about a week on a single charge according to CNET’s review. It isn’t perfect. It doesn’t feel as premium as some other watches of the same price, it doesn’t have as many apps as the Apple Watch, and the software may not feel as intuitive as alternative watches from Google, Samsung or Apple. The Garmin Venu 3 makes up for that with useful wellness tools like the Body Battery, which tells you how “recharged” you are based on activity, sleep and other factors. Best of all, Garmin doesn’t require a subscription to access such features. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple's best smartwatch, with a tough titanium construction and an Action button to quickly start workouts or launch apps. It has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch at a maximum of 3,000 nits which makes it incredibly easy to see when adventuring in the great outdoors. For adventurers and athletes, it also has a built-in siren for safety and a dual-band GPS for accurately tracking your route. LTE is also onboard so you can venture out without a phone and still stay connected. Though it's designed to be an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still a fantastic all-around smartwatch. Inside is the same S9 chip as found on the Apple Watch Series 9 which supports gestures like Double Tap and allows the watch to process Siri commands on-device. This means you can use Siri without being online and later in the year you'll be able to ask the voice assistant for health data. Like earlier Apple Watches, the Ultra 2 also comes with a blood oxygen sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) app, fall detection and emergency SOS. The battery also lasts at least twice as long as all other Apple Watch models. It's only compatible with the iPhone, so if you have an Android phone, you'll want to look at another option on this list. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 6 is the best Android watch for most people. Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic have incredibly bright screens that hit a maximum of 2,000 nits, so seeing your watch in all lighting conditions is easy. All the flagship features you would expect are included: an ECG, blood oxygen, body composition and temperature sensors. Note you do need a Galaxy phone to use the ECG, but all the other features work seamlessly with other Android phones. Like the Apple Watch Series 9, you'll need to charge the Galaxy Watch 6 every day, especially if you want to track sleep. 2023's GalaxyWatch 5 Proremains in the lineup if you need the best battery life of any Galaxy Watch, lasting up to three days on a charge. The Apple Watch SE retails for $250 but you can regularly find it discounted to $200 or less, which makes it an excellent choice for the budget-conscious buyer. Expect most of the same features found on more expensive Apple Watch models like the Series 9, including activity tracking, third-party apps and safety features like Emergency SOS. It does miss out on an always-on display and heart-health features like the ECG. Consider last year's model:Many new smartwatches offer incremental hardware updates over previous models, so you might want to look at the last generation's smartwatch to save some cash -- especially because software updates often bring new features to older models. For example, you could look at something like the Apple Watch Series 9 which is compatible with the latest WatchOS 11 update to get many of the same software features as the newer Series 9. Avoid buying smartwatches that are several years old, as they may start to feel sluggish. Buy at the right time of year:Smartwatches usually go on sale during Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it’s a good idea to look out for discounts around those holidays. Knowing when new devices typically launch can also be helpful. After all, you don’t want to purchase a brand new smartwatch only for it to feel out of date two months later. Samsung, Apple and Google usually release new smartwatches in the late summer and early fall time frame, but you can find more information on typical launch periodshere. Look at added costs: Some smartwatches are moving toward a subscription model that unlocks certain features of your watch. Google's Pixel Watch, for example, offers a monthly $10 subscription called Fitbit Premium that offers more in-depth sleep tracking metrics, workout programs and guidance on recovery. We test smartwatches in the real world, focusing on key features from fitness tracking to connectivity that you'll use every day. Starting with the watch itself, we check overall performance and responsiveness. Is there any lag when navigating menus? Is the touchscreen responsive? Do apps launch quickly? Then we check if it has all the functionality you'd expect for the price. That could be everything from music playback controls to cellular connectivity so you can use the watch away from your phone or an always-on display. All smartwatches need to connect to a phone, so we also assess how easy the companion software is to navigate. The iPhone 15 mounted on a bike. Durability and design Smartwatches are something you wear on your body, so we assess how comfortable they are to wear. We also know that everyone has a different-sized wrist, so we try to see how it fits and feels on a variety of people. Then we look at how it stands up to wear and tear with daily life. Some smartwatches offer increased durability like dust resistance, or water resistance that's suited for activities like scuba diving and where possible we'll test this out for ourselves. Google Pixel Watch 2 with the charger attached vertical Battery life Battery life will vary depending on how you use a smartwatch, so we test battery life with a few standard tests. We see how long it generally lasts on a single charge with features that represent typical use, like the always-on display, sleep tracking and doing an outdoor workout with GPS. Fitness and health sensor accuracy We test the accuracy of smartwatch sensors in a couple of different ways. For example, the heart rate sensor is compared against the readings taken from a chest strap, considered the gold standard in consumer heart rate tracking. We compare readings from the watch against the strap for resting heart rate, and heart rate during a variety of cardio-based activities like running or cycling. We check to see how long it takes to connect to a GPS signal when doing an outdoor workout. Other health sensors, like a blood oxygen sensor, are compared against a pulse oximeter for spot readings where possible.","From the Apple Watch Series 10 to watches from Google and Garmin.

Return policy In case the open earbuds aren't a great fit for your ears, it's important that the retailer offers a good return policy. While open-ear headphones have been around for a while, open-ear wireless earbuds are a relatively recent concept. There are several excellent open earbuds on the market in various designs, but a couple of newer models stand out. Our top picks includeApple's AirPods 4 with Active Noise CancellationandBose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which have a unique clip-on design. Both have top sound for open earbuds and would make for a perfect gift thisholiday shopping season. Open earbuds don’t have the noise-isolating silicone tips that typically seal off the ear canal and support active noise cancellation. If you find ear tips uncomfortable or dislike their listening experience, open earbuds might be a better option for you. If you’re concerned about staying alert while wearing earbuds -- like hearing approaching vehicles while running or biking -- open earbuds can be a great choice, since your ears aren't sealed. For more options suitable for the gym, see our roundup of thebest earbuds and headphones for working out. I've tested hundreds of headphones over 20 years of evaluating headphones, and I've used all the models on this list and fully reviewed many of them. Plus, many of these open wireless earbuds are also featured on our other pages, including ourbest running headphonesandbest true wireless sports earbuds with ear hooks. I'll update this list as I test more worthy candidates. Read more:Best True Wireless Earbuds for 2024 The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. They're still true wireless earbuds, and at $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds. SCORE If you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features. Ultimately, however, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it. SCORE Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs ""air conduction"" technology. While Shokz' flagship OpenFit buds sound slightly better and have a little better battery life (7 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels), the Open Fit Air cost $60 less and may actually fit some people's ears better. Available in three color options, they're lightweight (8.5 grams) and comfortable, and I liked how the ear hooks felt soft but had just the right amount of rigidity. They're IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant and their charging case is fairly compact for this style of sports buds with ear hooks. While the earbuds sound quite good for open earbuds, they don't sound quite as good as a set of noise-isolating earbuds in this price range (they're a tad bass shy). Nor do they sound as good Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more and serve up a little more bass and fuller sound (the Bose also sound slightly better than Shokz Open Fit buds). Equipped with two microphones in each bud, the Open Fit Air offer good voice-calling performance. Additionally, the feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously.  Amazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that ofApple's AirPods 3, which deliver fuller bass and overall fuller, smoother sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 3 cost around $180 and offer only about 15% to 20% better audio. In short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or ""semi-open"" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale. What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof. And be sure to activate theinstant 20% off couponto save a few bucks at checkout on Amazon. The Soundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro are among the best open-ear ""air conduction"" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job reducing background noise reduction) and also offer strong battery life -- up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels. While they don't have ear-detection sensors, I liked that they have physical buttons to control playback and also come with a cord, should you want to turn them into neckband-style wireless headphones. It's also worth noting that they have a spatial audio feature and offer the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android smartphones that support it for Bluetooth streaming. Anker's standard AeroFit fit model ($100) has smaller drivers (14mm versus 16.2mm for the Pro), so it doesn't sound quite as good, and also has a battery life rating of 11 hours. However, those buds are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, while these are splash-proof with an IPX5 rating. Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. Models like the OpenRun Pro, which deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones, are popular with runners and bikers who like to leave their ears open for safety reasons. However, Shokz's new OpenFit model, the company's first true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs ""air conduction"" technology. I was impressed by how lightweight (8.3 grams) and comfortable they are -- they have one of the best ear-hook designs I've tried (Shokz calls it a Dolphin Arc ear hook). It's soft and offers just the right amount of flexibility to conform to the shape of your ear, with ""dual-layered liquid silicone that provides a pliable fit,"" according to Shokz. The earbuds also sound quite good for open earbuds, though not quite as good as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more. If you can't quite afford this model, Shokz has released the newer Open Fit Air, which costs $60 less and may actually fit some people's ears better. It doesn't sound quite as good as the OpenFit, but the sound is pretty close. 1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. TheFit S50buds are the flagship ($120) and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splashproof (it can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value. The case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows your to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. Currently, you can grab these at a 20% discount, thanks to the on-page coupon. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new open wireless earbuds. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150. It's key that open wireless earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation. Since all the buds on this list have an open design, they should stay in your ears well. Some will fit in your ears more comfortably than others. You want open wireless buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating. It's critical to buy your open wireless earbuds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one. We test open wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,features,voice-calling performanceandvalue. We assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings. We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the open earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment. Some great-sounding open earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. We determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Our reviewer David Carnoy testing voice-calling performance on the noisy streets of New York. Sony Link Buds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple'sstandard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-isolating earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as good sound and very good voice-calling performance. Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport: Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new ""enhanced"" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product. Samsung Galaxy Buds Live: Samsung's bean-shaped earbuds were a hit when they came out in 2020, but they've become outdated. Like the standard AirPods, they have an open design, so you don't jam an ear tip into your ear. They're comfortable to wear and fit my ears more securely than the AirPods. These wireless buds are discreet and basically sit flush with your ear, which reduces wind-noise while biking. I regularly use them for running and biking, and they're great for sporting activities if they fit your ears well. But one warning: Some people won't get a secure fit, so buy them from a retailer that has a good return policy. It depends. Open earbuds are an excellent solution for activities that require some situational awareness; working in the office, walking around town, running outside with traffic or even hanging out at home. For those who want to hear the world around them while listening to music, open earbuds are your best option. But if you do your best work without distractions (think writing an essay or editing a spreadsheet) or just prefer to focus on the music, you may want to opt for something else. Because open earbuds don't include noise canceling (or noise cancelling, if you're from the UK), outside, ambient noise can creep in through the cracks. Consider your work style and needs before choosing some open earbuds. It's a matter of personal preference, but many people prefer an open headphone design to a closed. Open or semi-open designs can offer a more comfortable fit as they don't seal off the canal with a squishy silicone tip. Because they don't seal off your ear canal, they let ambient sound in so you can hear what's going on around you. That can be an important safety feature for some people, including runners and bikers who want to hear cars approaching. However, the downside to their openness is that if you're in a noisy environment, the ambient sound will make it harder to hear what you're listening to. Also, open earbuds have a harder time producing strong bass, which affects sound quality. I suggest trying both open and closed true-wireless earbuds to see which design you prefer for everyday use, or switch between the two depending on your daily needs. With open earbuds, it's important that you get the right fit so they not only stay in your ears but so they sound and perform at their best. If you have trouble keeping earbuds in your ears, your best bet is to look for a model that includes wingtips or actually integrates them into the buds' design. You can also get earbuds that have ear hooks that wrap around the top of your ears. Several sports buds feature this design. It can be particularly appealing to bikers who can't afford to have their earbuds drop out of their ears while riding at high speed. Ensure you're choosing a pair with a secure design, like those with ear hooks that wrap around the back of your ear, and adjust the placement so that they comfortably grip the outer part of your ear without placing too much pressure on the ear canal. You can also try wearing a headband or ear warmers for an extra boost, especially during physical activity. In some cases, like with regular AirPods models, you may find that a secure fit isn't entirely within the cards. AirPods have never fit all ears equally well, and a lot of people complain that they won't stay securely in their ears. You can buy third-party wingtips -- sometimes called sport fins -- that lock the buds in your ears. But you have to take them off every time you use your buds because they won't fit in the case.  While both open earbuds and bone conduction headphones allow you to hear outside noise, the better option depends on your needs. Because open earbuds send vibrations directly to the ear canal via air conduction, they provide a much higher quality of overall sound -- great for music lovers. They're also ideal for all-day comfortable wear, especially for active people and runners. Still, some people find anything in or on their ears for long periods of time uncomfortable. Because bone conduction headphones deliver sound through your cheekbones, those who find ear tips difficult to manage may prefer their off-ear design. Also, higher-pitched sounds and voices are especially clear on bone conduction headphones, so they're great for listening to podcasts or taking phone calls. If you're looking to explore this option more, check out our roundup of thebest bone conduction headphonesthis year. We havean article on how to clean your AirPodsthat also applies to other open earbuds. But if you don't want to read that, the condensed version is this: Wipe down both the buds themselves and ear tips with a slightly dampened soft, dry, lint-free cloth (like the kind you use to clean glasses or your phone's screen) and avoid using any soap or harsh cleaning liquids. A 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or a Clorox disinfecting wipe is OK but avoid getting too much moisture in any ports or inside the buds themself. You can also use a toothpick for any little crevices or a Q-tip with a bit of alcohol on it. Avoid saturating the Q-tip with alcohol. Finally, wait a few minutes until any moisture evaporates before using the buds. A battery life rating of five hours is considered adequate, but many of the latest buds offer 10 hours or more. If you plan on using your open earbuds for long periods of time, we highlighted several models that are suitable for double-digit use like theAnker AeroFit Proor the1More Fit SE S30.

368,Best Laptop of 2024,"What to consider Price Statistically, you’ll hold onto your next laptop for at least three years. The current sweet spot for a reliable laptop to handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges to get the best configuration you can for your money. Operating System Choosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. MacBooks currently start at $999, so if you need a laptop for significantly less, it’s Windows. A Chromebook running on Google’s ChromeOS is an excellent (and less expensive) alternative to Windows or MacOS if almost everything you do is in a web browser. They can’t run Windows or Mac software. Size Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen, which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Screen When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: size, resolution, what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. Higher resolutions are better for fitting more on a screen and look for a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb. If the color range is important, look for at least 100% sRGB, or better yet 100% DCI-P3. Processor Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops with Qualcomm emerging as a third option with its Arm-baed Snapdragon X chips. Apple makes its own Arm-based chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. You'll still want to pay attention to the number of cores -- the more, the better -- to gauge potential performance as well as Intel x86 vs Arm. Graphics The graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's better for smaller, lighter laptops, but it doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. For things like video editing, gaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU. Memory For memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and the storage drive, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Storage You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in many models. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives.

If you're looking for a do-it-all laptop that doesn't sacrifice portability and battery life for performance, I recommend the M3 MacBook Air. It's available in 13- and 15-inch sizes, so you can choose between greater mobility or more workspace. The latest MacBook Air starts at$1,099 from Appleand now includes 16GB of RAM -- up from the meager 8GB it previously offered. The latest M3 Air can usually be found for$899 at Amazon, but for students and those on tighter budgets, I suggest theMacBook Air M1, which is still anall-around good pick for $649. A Windows rival to the MacBook Air has arrived in the form of Microsoft's firstCopilot Plus PC. Based on aQualcomm Snapdragon XCPU, theSurface Laptop 7offers strong application and AI performance and outstanding battery life. It's the first Windows laptop I've tested with a longer runtime than that of the MacBook Air. With a design that's on par with the Air's, the Surface Laptop 7 is one of thebest laptops. So is Dell's first Copilot Plus PC, theInspiron 14 Plus 7441, which is the second Windows laptop to outlast the MacBook Air and offers an even longer runtime than the Surface Laptop 7. While these are our top picks, the list below has even more options covering everything from a powerhouse gaming laptop to a content-creation machine to a simple Chromebook for getting work done without emptying your wallet. We've also got a list of thebest laptops and tablets to give as giftsthis season you can use to whittle down yourholiday shoppinglist.  Read more: For Apple's latest MacBook Air, little has changed from its predecessor beyond a move from Apple's M2 silicon to M3 chips. The performance differences are overall modest, but graphics performance does get a notable bump. The biggest feature additions are faster Wi-Fi 6E support and the capability to run dual external displays, albeit at the cost of having the Air's lid closed. Still, since Apple gave the M2 MacBook Air (our previous best overall laptop pick) the full update treatment, the fact the M3 version is nearly the same except for faster performance doesn't bother us in the slightest -- it's just that much better. If you're still rocking an Intel-based Air or an M1 Air, the M3 MacBook Air is a worthy upgrade. The M3 Air starts at $1,099 at Apple and now includes 16GB of RAM at minimum to help it runApple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI tools. The baseline storage remains and an undersized 256GB SSD, so you might consider spending the extra $200 to double it.  SCORE Power in motion. AI-ready. The XPS 14 balances performance and mobility in a striking form factor. Create on the go with its lightweight 3.7-pound design, slim 18mm size and long battery life.​ Powered by AI-enabled Intel Core Ultra processors. There are a lot of Windows laptops. A lot. Which makes it more than a little tricky to narrow it down to just one. The HP Pavilion Plus is exemplary because it can meet the needs of a lot of people while still being affordable. It’s available in 14- and 16-inch sizes. We tested the 14-inch model, which is small enough for travel but big enough that you won’t feel cramped while working. HP offers AMD and Intel processors, and it can be configured with entry-level discrete graphics too. There are also multiple displays to match your budget, including a beautiful OLED panel. HP has discontinued its Pavilion laptops in favor of the OmniBook brand, and this model is now out of stock at HP. But you can find our AMD-based test model -- complete with a 2.8K OLED display -- at Amazon for a reasonable $1,049. That's a pretty good price for an all-metal OLED laptop with a sufficient 16GB of RAM and a roomy 1TB SSD. SCORE The Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-on-Windows efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited compatibility, with many x86 apps unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved, and so has compatibility. We saw a strong overall performance from the Snapdragon X Elite processor and jaw-dropping battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that’s the longest runtime of any 13- or 14-inch laptop we ever reviewed -- including the M3 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air not only in performance and battery life but also supplies a similarly sleek and solid build. For general use, you probably don't need the 32GB of RAM of our test system and can save some money and configure the system with 16GB of memory. We wish there was an OLED display option, and you’ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you’ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. SCORE Dell’s new Copilot Plus PC lasted for more than 23 hours on our YouTube streaming battery drain test. That's one of the longest laptop runtimes we have ever seen. Inspiron 14 Plus 7441’s design is fairly basic and doesn't match the sleekness of Microsoft’s own Copilot Plus PC, the Surface Laptop 7, or Apple’s MacBook Air, but the Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 still supplies a rigid, all-metal chassis and crisp, 2.5K IPS display. At just $1,000, it's a bit more affordable than Microsoft’s and Apple’s models and is a great pick for a general-purpose, long-lasting laptop. Most people won't notice much if any performance difference between the higher-end Snapdragon X Elite chip and the Snapdragon X Plus chip of the Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 model that I tested. SCORE Despite the availability of the newer -- and better -- M3 and M2 MacBook Air models, the M1 MacBook Air (one of the first to switch from Intel to Apple silicon) stays around, exclusively from Walmart, and that's a good thing. It returned with a price of $699, and it's now discounted to a low of $599. As Apple's entry-level laptop, it's still a good choice for a MacOS laptop for basic everyday use. It has great performance, long battery life and is thin and light. The M1 processor and 8GB of RAM offer enough performance for school work, but you may need to embrace the cloud for storage because the 256GB SSD could fill up quickly, especially if you have a large photo and video library. SCORE For just $300, Acer’s entry-level Aspire Go 14 holds its own against other budget models that cost twice as much or even more. The design cannot be described as enticing or exciting, but it's functional and unlikely to offend. Performance from the quad-core AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series CPU and 8GB of RAM suffices for basic use, and its battery life is surprisingly long. The 14-inch display features a modern 16:10 aspect ratio and is sufficiently bright, but it suffers from poor viewing angles that might take some getting used to before you settle on the right angle to position the display. Another drawback is the tight storage of the laptop’s meager 128GB SSD. Neither drawback is a deal-breaker when you consider the bargain-basement price. The Aspire Go 14 provides great value with its acceptable build quality, capable performance and long battery life. SCORE With its excellent build quality, adequate display, strong performance and lengthy runtime, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use or students. It's a great deal at its price of $900 at Best Buy and an even better deal at its regularly discounted price of $800 direct from Lenovo. We like its solid, all-metal chassis and the power and efficiency you get from its AMD Ryzen 7 8000-series CPU. It lacks some of the refinement and extras you get with Lenovo’s flagship Yoga 9i 14, but the midrange Yoga 7 14 is much more affordable and the better pick for most people. SCORE Two items help make the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 our favorite two-in-one detachable laptop: Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Elite X processor and an excellent OLED display. The Arm-based CPU delivers competitive performance and far fewer compatibility issues for mainstream use than previous Windows-on-Arm efforts. It helps the Surface Pro 11 deliver a long runtime. The 13-inch OLED display supplies a crisp, 2.8K resolution along with P3 calibration and real HDR capability. It's the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in a while, but you still have to pay extra for a keyboard and stylus. SCORE Alienware rejiggered its midrange 16-inch m16 to fit more comfortably into its place in the company's gaming laptop universe. That meant lowering its configurations and redesigning it to meet the lower price target buyer. It's now easier on your wallet and to slip into a backpack. There are certainlymore powerful gaming laptops, but the m16 meets the needs of a broader audience, so for the moment, it's our top pick. The line starts at $1,499 with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, GeForce RTX 4050, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB SSD and the basic single-zone RGB keyboard. The only display available is the sRGB 16-inch, 2,560x1,600, 120Hz/240Hz dynamically switchable model. Bumping to an RTX 4060 costs $100 and to the RTX 4070 another $200. 32GB of RAM adds $150, or $250 over that for 64GB. SCORE Like other gaming laptop makers, Acer has two lines: the budget-friendly Nitro series under the Acer brand and midrange and premium models that carry the Predator label. Oddly enough, it's under the latter you'll find our budget gaming pick: the Helios Neo 16. It is strikingly similar to the Acer Nitro 16 but with slightly better build quality and graphics performance from its RTX 4050 GPU. The only place it really faltered was its speakers, which put out disappointingly flat audio with nonexistent bass. The Predator Helios Neo 16 currently costs $1,200. That is high for a budget gaming laptop. The trick is to be patient and wait for a sale, which happens regularly, and the price drops below $1,000 where it's a good deal for a system that has any type of Nvidia RTX graphics. SCORE It delivers no surprises or revolutionary upgrades from past iterations, but the ThinkPad X1 Carbon's security features, build quality and performance remain excellent. Its 14-inch display and 2.5-pound weight are the sweet spot of enough screen space to work long stretches without needing to connect to an external display, while also being light enough for daily travel. With an industry-best keyboard, long battery life and greener construction, the X1 Carbon Gen 11 is a near-perfect business laptop. Lenovo has increased pricing from previous Gen 11 to Gen 12 models to where we've reached a point where the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is no longer our recommendation for business execs unless your organization is large enough to qualify for volume pricing. For individual buyers, it's simply too expensive for the performance and battery life it provides. For most business users, the previous Gen 11 is the better buy. Its 13th-gen Core i7 CPU is getting a little long in the tooth, but I would recommend the Core Ultra Gen 12 model only if you can find it at a steep discount. SCORE Apple's latest update its16-inch MacBook Prodelivers M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max processors along with an improved webcam and an optional nano-texture nonreflective finish for the display. The design remains unchanged from the previous version, but under the hood, the new M4 Pro chip offers better overall performance and, in particular, big gains in multicore and rendering performance. Like the previous series, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro processor starts at $2,499, and the M4 Max model starts at $3,499. The previous M3 Pro version won our Editors' Choice for its excellent combination of design, performance and battery life. We are currently testing the latest M4 Pro model and will have a final rating soon, but you can expect the 16-inch MacBook Pro to continue to be among our favorites for graphics pros and creators. This new Chromebook Plus model delivers good performance and even better battery life along with a respectably bright display with a matte finish to limit glare. It has more storage than you'd typically find at its price. The model we reviewed lacked keyboard backlighting, which was a bit of a bummer, but Acer does sell models with a backlit keyboard that aren’t that much more expensive. It's a fixed configuration based on an Intel Core i3-N305 CPU and 8GB of RAM. Those specs might seem underpowered but suffice for ChromeOS, which is must more lightweight than Windows. With its mix of features and performance for the price, it’s easy to recommend for school, work or home. SCORE Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i: It's thin and light for its size, but a short runtime and a few design miscues make this a low-cost laptop to skip. Acer Swift Go 14 AI: This Snapdragon X-powered laptop can run all day, but its overall look might put you to sleep. Acer Swift 14 AI: It’s a long-lasting if basic Copilot Plus PC, but do we really need an AI indicator light on the touchpad? Lenovo ThinkBook 14 2-in-1 Gen 4: I wish you could upgrade the display, but this low-cost two-in-one business laptop lets you add more RAM and a second SSD after purchase to extend your investment. Lenovo Yoga 7 16 Gen 9: Lenovo's 16-inch convertible is a good budget buy, but it's better as a secondary machine than your daily driver. Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 Gen 9: Lenovo's flagship two-in-one has AV advantages over its midrange sibling, but you'll pay a premium price for the OLED display and quad speakers. Asus Zenbook S 14: Intel's Core Ultra Series 2 processors show improvement from the first generation, but Apple's and Qualcomm's ARM-based chips still lead the way. HP OmniBook X 14: The latest Copilot Plus PC runs for more hours than there are hours in a day. Lenovo LOQ 15IAX9I: It's super cheap, with a dedicated Intel Arc GPU that lends it a wee bit of 3D muscle for casual 1080p play. Asus ROG Zephyrus G16: It’s a top gaming laptop for creators too. Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 7445: A dim display dulls Dell's otherwise well-rounded, AI-equipped and affordable 14-inch convertible laptop. Acer Swift X 14 (2024): The design won't wow you, but the 14.5-inch OLED display powered by RTX 4070 graphics is a great combo for on-the-go content creation. Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7640: Content creators may bemoan the display choices, but this midtier, 16-inch laptop offers well-rounded performance from its Core Ultra chip and RTX graphics. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold 16: Lenovo makes strides with its second foldable-display laptop, but further refinements are still needed before it's ready for the masses. Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Q425: It's a boon to get an OLED display in such a portable package with great battery life for roughly $1,000, but the fit and finish feel decidedly midrange. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12: The latest X1 Carbon has many charms, but they will remain out of reach for many business buyers constrained by budgets. Dell XPS 16 9640: Dell's new 16-inch XPS model offers a unique design backed by strong performance and surprisingly long battery life. Just be prepared to pay for its many configurable charms. Alienware m18 R2 Gaming Laptop: When you're this big, the sky's the limit. Dell XPS 14 9440: The radical look is sure to turn heads, but some of the daring design elements could be turn-offs. HP Omen Transcend 14: Neither a featureless slab nor a carnival of lights, HP's latest 14-inch Omen has its own unique flair. It doesn't scrimp on substance either. Lenovo Slim 7i: With an OLED display and a solid build, this is a rugged option for mainstream shoppers, but other touches are decidedly midrange. Dell Inspiron 14 Plus 7440: For a reasonable $1,000, this 14-inch Dell model based on an Intel Core Ultra CPU lets you be productive and remain portable. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i: We love a good budget laptop, but this one comes up a little short unless you can find it at a steep discount. The review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. We test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, includingPrimate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6,Cinebench R23,PCMark 10, a variety of3DMarkbenchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks fromGuardians of the Galaxy,The Rift Breaker(CPU and GPU) andShadow of the Tomb Raider. For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price. The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on ourHow We Test Computerspage. Amazon’sPrime Dayis a great time to find a laptop at a great price. Other times of the year when you can find the best laptop deals are during back-to-school sales in late summer or early fall and a bit later in the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You can find discounts on laptops throughout the year, but if you're looking for the best deal and can afford to wait, these are typically the best times to buy one. Apple’s MacBooks are the most popular laptops and for good reason. They offer excellent build quality and leading performance and battery life ever since Apple introduced its M series processors in 2020. The top two brands on the Windows side are Lenovo and HP. Both offer a wide variety of models, from thin-and-light ultraportables to larger, more powerful models for gaming content creation. Lenovo’s ThinkPads have long been a favorite among business laptops, and its Yoga models are usually highly rated two-in-one laptops. HP is in the middle of a branding transformation. It's ended its Pavilion, Envy and Spectre laptop brands in favor of OmniBook consumer models and EliteBook business models. Its Omen brand will continue as the home for its gaming laptops. I liked the firstOmniBook laptop I reviewedand look forward to testing more. There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment, and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking. The search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. That stands whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop as you can afford from the start. Generally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capabilities for less. Choosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS, too. When it comes to price and variety (and PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you'll have to consider older refurbished ones. Windows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to, but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist. If you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have aChrome, Android or Linux app before making the leap. If you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they're a good fit. Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen -- hello, laws of physics -- which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn't necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can't expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on. When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: how much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. You really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means a sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen atDPI Calculatorif you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) I recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb. Because of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet. If you need a laptop with relatively accurate color, that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can't simply trust the specs -- not because manufacturers lie, but because they usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides forgeneral purpose monitors,creators,gamers and HDR viewing. The processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with itsArm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head toIntel'sorAMD'ssites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be. Apple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. Like Intel and AMD, you'll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance. Battery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple’s Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-basedCopilot Plus PCswe’ve tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD. The graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU. Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU. For more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs. For memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded. Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls. You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. Get what you can afford, and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game. Setting a budget is a good place to start when shopping for the best laptop for yourself. The good news is you can get a nice-looking, lightweight laptop with excellent battery life at prices under $500. If you're shopping for a laptop around $500 or less, check out our top picks here, as well as morespecific buying advice for that price range. Higher-end components like Intel Core Ultra and AMD Ryzen processors and premium design touches like thin-display bezels and aluminum or magnesium bodies have made their way to laptops priced between $500 and $1,000. You can also find touchscreens and two-in-one designs that can be used as a tablet or a laptop -- and a couple of other positions in between. In this price range, you'll also find faster memory and SSD storage -- and more of it -- to improve performance. Above $1,000 is where you'll find premium laptops and two-in-ones. If you're looking for the fastest performance, the best battery life, the slimmest, lightest designs and top-notch display quality with an adequate screen size, expect to spend at least $1,000. Deciding between MacOS and Windows laptops for many people will come down to personal preference and budget. Apple's base model laptop, the M1 MacBook Air, starts at $999. You can sometimes find it discounted or you can get educational pricing from Apple and other retailers. In general, it'll be at least $1,000 for a new MacBook, and the prices just go up from there. For the money, you're getting great hardware top to bottom, inside and out. Apple recently moved to using its own processors, which resulted inacross-the-board performance improvementscompared to older Intel-based models. The company's most powerful laptop, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, still hasn't been updated to Apple silicon. Again, that great hardware comes at a price. Also, you're limited to just Apple laptops. With Windows and Chromebooks (more on these below), you get an amazing variety of devices at a wide range of prices. Software between the two is plentiful, so unless you need to run something that's only available on one platform or the other, you should be fine to go with either. Gaming is definitely an advantage for a Windows laptop. MacOS is also considered to be easier and safer to use than Windows, especially for people who want their computers to get out of the way so they can get things done. Over the years, Microsoft has done its best to follow suit and, withWindows 11 here,it's trying to remove any barriers. Also, while Macs might have a reputation for being safer, with the popularity of the iPhone and iPad helping to drive Mac sales,they've become bigger targets for malware. Yes, they are, but they're not for everyone.Google's Chrome OS has come a long way in the 10-plus yearssince they arrived and Chromebooks -- laptops that run on Chrome OS -- are great for people who do most of their work in a web browser or using mobile apps. They are secure, simple and, more often than not, a bargain. What they can't do is natively run Windows or Mac software. The pandemic changed how and where a lot of people work. The small, ultraportable laptops valued by people who regularly travel may have suddenly become woefully inadequate for working from home. Or maybe instead of needing long battery life, you'd rather have a bigger display with more graphics power for gaming. If you're going to be working on a laptop and don't need more mobility than moving it from room to room, consider a 15.6-inch laptop or larger. In general, a bigger screen makes life easier for work and is more enjoyable for entertainment, and it also is better if you're using it as an extended display with an external monitor. It typically means you're getting more ports too, so connecting an external display or storage or a keyboard and mouse is easier without requiring a hub or dock. For travel, stay with 13- or 14-inch laptops or two-in-ones. They'll be the lightest and smallest while still delivering excellent battery life. What's nice is that PC-makers are moving away from 16:9 widescreens toward 16:10- or 3:2-ratio displays, which gives you more vertical screen space for work without significantly increasing the footprint. These models usually don't have discrete graphics or powerful processors, althoughthat's not always the case. You can play games and create content on any laptop. What games you play and what content you create -- and the speed at which you do them -- varies greatly depending on the components inside the laptop. For casual browser-based games or using streaming game services likeNvidia GeForce NowandXbox Cloud Gaming, you don't need a powerful gaming laptop. Similarly, if you're trimming video clips, cropping photos or live-streaming video from your webcam, you can get by with a modestly priced laptop or Chromebook with integrated graphics. For anything more demanding, you'll need to invest more money in discrete graphics like Nvidia's RTX 30- or 40-series GPUs. Increased system memory of 16GB or more, having a speedy SSD of at least 512GB for storage and a faster processor such as an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 will all help you get things moving faster too. The other piece you'll want to consider is the display. For gaming, look for screens with a high refresh rate of 120Hz or faster so games look smoother while playing. For content creation, look for displays that cover at least 100% sRGB color space or, better yet, 100% DCI-P3.",We tested and reviewed a lot of laptops this year.

369,Best Noise-Canceling Earbuds for 2024,"What to consider  Budget It's important to know how much you want to spend, and what features you want, before going too far into research. Fit A secure fit in your ears not only impacts how comfortable the earbuds are but the quality of sound can also be impacted. Return policy Where you buy from matters, especially if you end up not liking the headphones once you put them on. Here at CNET, we've put a lot of work into our list of the best full-sizeover-the-ear noise-canceling headphones. However, since wireless earbuds are a popular choice, I've put together this dedicated list of the best noise-canceling earbuds. Wireless earbuds are often the more convenient choice for most folks, since they're easier to carry around and are often just as good at muffling ambient noise as their heftier siblings. Since there are countless models on the market, this list includes not only the best premium wireless active noise-canceling earbuds but some affordable models as well. I've included a few budget picks that you might also find on our list of thebest cheap earbuds, as well as our roundup of thebest wireless earbuds overall. I've tested all the earbuds on this list and fully reviewed many of them.

Fit A secure fit in your ears not only impacts how comfortable the earbuds are but the quality of sound can also be impacted. Return policy Where you buy from matters, especially if you end up not liking the headphones once you put them on. The QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. A natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit. SCORE When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. They're excellent, but we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. At $300 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly too. Overall they're really impressive -- easily among the top earbuds on the market. SCORE Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. They offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Pro. Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE Earfun is one of our go-to brands for value earbuds. Its Air Pro 4 buds aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Input codeEAP4CNETat checkout on Amazon to get an extra 10% off). Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs. Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). The default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much. As I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio). I do think the voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. SCORE If you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro (read our full review). Yes, the noise cancellation might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. SCORE Google's redesigned itsPixel Buds Pro 2to fit more ears better. Not only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new ""hands-free, eyes-free"" Gemini virtual AI assistant. So long as you get a snug fit and tight seal (yes, that's critical for sound quality and noise-canceling performance), these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. SCORE The Live Beam 3 earbuds look similar to the earlierLive Buds Pro 2, which I like a lot, especially when they go on sale for less than $100. Essentially JBL's AirPods Pro 2 competitor, their distinguishing feature is the 1.45-inch touchscreen LCD integrated into their charging case that acts as a remote control for the buds and allows you to access their features. Equipped with 10mm drivers, not only do they offer clear, well-defined sound with punchy bass but their noise canceling and voice-calling performance are very solid. The battery is also good -- it offers up to 10 hours of battery life with ANC on and 12 hours with it off at moderate volume levels (a 10-minute charge gives you four hours of battery life). Available in four color options, they're IP55 splash-proof and dust-resistant. Note that JBL's flagship Tour Pro 3 earbuds also have an integrated LCD but feature dual drivers, which deliver even better sound than these buds with a little more depth and detail. The Live Beam 3 earbuds often sell for $50 off the $200 list price, which makes them a better deal overall. Truth be told, in some ways, I likeSony's new LinkBuds Fitbetter than itsflagship WF-1000XM5noise-canceling earbuds. They don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, but they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls.Read our hands-on first take. The Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensiveStudio Budsand new-for-2023Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of theAirPods Pro'sfeatures, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. SCORE Simply put, the Pi8s are fantastic-sounding earbuds that also benefit from having a clearly improved design from the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2. It's debatable whether the Pi8s sound $150 better than the step-down Pi6s (they're also new for 2024), but there's no doubt these are some of the best-sounding earbuds on the market, if not the best (everybody's sound tastes vary so it's hard to declare one set of buds the best-sounding overall). Like with the Pi7 S2, sound quality is the highlight here, along with the charging case's ability to transform into a Bluetooth transceiver. Noise cancellation seems improved, and noise reduction during calls seems better, but the voice-calling performance wasn't as good as what I got with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. If you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features. Ultimately, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it. SCORE Nothing has changed with Nothing's latest $149 Ear noise-cancelling earbuds. At least, not at first glance. You'd be forgiven if you thought the buds had taken a step back; while they're the successor to Nothing's Ear (2) earbuds they don't have a 3 anywhere in their name. Nor do they employ Apple's generational naming scheme. They're just the Nothing Ear, and they look the same as the Ear (2). Some changes on the inside deliver legitimate improvements, particularly to sound quality, noise canceling and battery life. If you can't quite afford this model, Nothing also has the new $99 Ear (a), which comes in a new yellow color as well as white and black. It has different drivers and includes a smaller charging case (it has a lower IPX2 water-resistance rating and leaves off wireless charging), but otherwise has very similar features and might be a slightly better value. The flagship Ear does sound slightly better. SCORE Whenever a new pair of Momentum True Wireless earbuds drops, I always find myself saying, ""Wow, these sound good."" Sound quality has always been the MTW's biggest strength, and that remains the case with the fourth-gen version. There have been some modest improvements in other areas, particularly with the noise-canceling performance and the reliable, hiccup-free Bluetooth connection I had with my phone. At the same time, the voice-calling performance could be better, and I'm a little disappointed that these aren't even more of an upgrade over their predecessor. Still, the Momentum True Wireless 4 are excellent earbuds that I have no problem recommending. SCORE Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus Buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. The transparent version is getting a lot of attention (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' ""acoustic architecture"" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds. SCORE Released in 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than 2022's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splash-proof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise cancellation and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging. There are no discounts on these headphones right now, but the Anker Soundcore C30i clip-on headphones cost $70. I thought Beyerdynamic's first pair of true-wireless earbuds, the Free Byrd, sounded impressive. But they were a little bulky and their design left something to be desired. That isn't the case for its new-for-2024 Amiron 300 buds. They're compact, lightweight and fit my ears well -- I was able to get a tight seal with the largest ear tip. While their noise-canceling function falls short of what you get with flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Sony, Bose and Apple -- it's decent enough but not great -- the Amiron 300's sound is rich, detailed and fairly open (you can can distinctly hear each instrument). They have a pleasant tonal balance, and you can tweak their EQ settings in Beyerdynamic's companion app. The bass is articulate and punchy and there's nice clarity and accuracy to the midrange (where voices live). The buds support the SBC, AAC and LDAC audio codecs and have some of the key features you'd expect from premium earbuds. These include ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear and resume playback when you put it back in, wireless charging, transparency and low-latency modes and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3). I thought their touch controls worked well and battery life was solid -- they're rated for up to 7 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and up to 10 hours with it off. They have three microphones in each bud and callers said they could hear me well even in noisy environments with only a bit of background noise intruding. Status Audio's earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you are getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, although they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me. They have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors, and they only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but, as I said, they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's in part due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side -- they feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new earbuds. Value-priced earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" buds for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for premium buds from Sony, Apple and Bose, be prepared to spend a lot more. It's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise cancellation can be dramatically affected for the worse. Open earbuds don't have that issue, but they should be comfortable to wear and sit securely in your ears. Because the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy. That means you can return the buds if they aren't a good match for your ears. We test noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria, comparing similarly  styled and priced models. These criteria includedesign,sound quality,noise-canceling performance,voice-calling performance, featuresandvalue. Bowers & Wilkins PI7 S2: In 2023, Bowers & Wilkins upgraded its fantastic-sounding PI7 noise-canceling earbuds. The new S2 model has better battery life and Bluetooth range, now up to 25 meters (double the previous range). Additionally, the buds now integrate into the new Bowers & Wilkins Music app for iOS and Android and have a much-improved setup experience. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's newLive Pro 2andLive Free 2buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. Master & Dynamic MW09: Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds ($349) look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to noise canceling. The earbuds sound great but are mysteriously out of stock everywhere, so we dropped them from the best list. If they come back in stock, we'll add them back to this list. Sony LinkBuds S: Unlike the ""open"" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating earbuds with tips that jam in your ears. They're more compact and lighter than Sony's former flagship WF-1000XM4 and also feature Sony's V1 processor (Sony has since released the more compact WF-1000XM5). Their sound and noise canceling don't quite measure up to either XM4s or XM5s, but they're still quite good. They're the Sony buds for people who can't afford Sony's flagship earbuds but want 80% of those buds' features and performance for significantly less. Sony WF-1000XM4: Released in 2021, Sony's WF-1000XM4 earned a CNET Editors' Choice Award. They're still excellent earbuds, but Sony has now released the next-gen WF-1000XM5. They may be a good option if you find them at a good discount. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 were among the best new true-wireless earbuds of 2022. They're still among the best truly wireless earbuds, but Sennheiser has released the upgraded Momentum True Wireless 4. Also, the newer AirPods Pro 2 and Sony WF-1000XM5 buds are arguably superior, so only look to buy the Momentum True Wireless 3 when they're significantly discounted. JBL Tour Pro 2: JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds have received a lot of attention for bringing something new to true-wireless earbuds: a full-color touchscreen display embedded in the case that allows you to access the earbuds' key features and control playback as well as adjust volume levels. It's a bit of a gimmick but also useful. The buds could sound slightly better for their list price, but overall the JBL Tour Pro 2s are very good earbuds that offer a good fit, a robust feature set, strong battery life, plus solid noise canceling and voice-calling performance. Beyerdynamic Free Byrd: Beyerdynamic may be late to the game, but it's finally introduced its first truly wireless earbuds, which feature active noise canceling, up to 11 hours of battery life (with noise canceling off) and impressive sound quality.Read our Beyerdynamic Free Byrd review. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2: Available in four colors, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 noise-canceling headphones don't feature as good sound or noise canceling as the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, but they're compact (15% smaller and 20% lighter than the earlier Buds Plus, they barely stick out of your ears) and cost significantly less. Because they sit more flush with your ears -- and have that curved design -- they also pick up less wind noise. They're IPX2 sweat-resistant while the step-up Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are fully waterproof (IPX7). Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX: Bang & Olufsen's $399 Beoplay EX buds are the company's best true-wireless earbuds. They feature a comfortable, secure fit (except perhaps for those with really smaller ears), top-notch build quality, great sound, good noise canceling and improved voice-calling performance over B&O's EQ buds, with three microphones in each earbud they help with reducing background noise while picking up your voice. They're out of most people's price range, they're arguably the best earbuds out there with stems and offer slightly superior sound to the AirPods Pro 2 with better clarity, deeper more powerful bass and richer, more accurate sound. Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4: Their sound isn't quite up to the level of higher-end buds likeApple's AirPods Pro 2and theSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3that cost significantly more, but the Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 earbuds have a strong set of features, including a spatial audio mode with head tracking, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, up to nine hours of battery life, wireless charging and support for Sony's LDAC audio codec that can offer sound improvements if you have the right setup. Sennheiser CX Plus: The Momentum True Wireless 3 are Sennheiser's flagship true-wireless earbuds. If you can't afford them, the CX Plus (which features very good sound and decent noise canceling) is a good alternative for a lot less money. The step-down CX, which has no active noise canceling, costs even less. When noise canceling is engaged, it does tend to have an impact on battery life. This is more of a factor with earbuds, which tend to offer anywhere from five to eight hours of battery life with noise canceling on and seven to 12 hours with it off. Full-size headphones can offer 25 to 30 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and up to 40 to 50 hours with it off. Active noise canceling can have a small adverse effect on sound quality, especially if the noise canceling isn't all that good (noise canceling can create a faint background hiss). It can mess with the purity of the sound quality so it's tricky to create a noise-canceling headphone that sounds really good. As a result, often high-end noise-canceling headphones that tout fantastic sound quality don't have as powerful noise canceling (the noise canceling feels lighter). Noise-canceling headphones and earbuds have traditionally been good at blocking out lower-frequency sounds such as the rumbling you hear while traveling on a plane. They haven't been so good at muffling higher frequencies (a baby screaming, for example) and even people talking around you. Companies like Bose, Sony and Apple have improved the technology in the last year or two so their noise canceling works across a wider range of frequencies. It still can't muffle all noise but top noise canceling is now doing a better job tamping down more noises that live in midrange and higher frequencies. Short answer: both. Either spelling is correct, as ""canceling"" is more common inAmerican Englishwhile ""cancelling"" is more common in British English. CNET uses ""noise canceling"" since the company is based in the US, but the noise is canceled just the same, regardless of spelling. Some people are very sensitive to noise canceling and end up feeling some pressure in their ears. As a result, some people can't use noise-canceling headphones or earbuds. Earbuds and headphones manufacturers have done a better job venting earbuds in recent years, relieving that pressure sensation.","There are a ton of noise-canceling earbuds to choose from, and we've tested the top options to find the best ones for you.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-noise-canceling-wireless-earbuds/,

What to consider  Budget Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker. Size Be sure to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. Durability Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dust-proof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, consider a more durable speaker. Speakerphone Capabilities Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. If you're looking for a compact portable Bluetooth speaker, you've come to the right place. I've tested all the speakers on this list, and while most of these speakers have their sound limitations, they do manage to deliver much better sound than you'd expect for their small size. Note that we also have a separate list of thebest overall Bluetooth speakers of 2024, which includes beefier portable wireless speakers and wireless Bluetooth boom boxes with built-in handles. This list only includes more compact models, most of which weigh 2 pounds or less. Many are fully waterproof and make for perfectholiday gifts. Choosing the best Bluetooth speaker overall is a tough decision given how many speakers are out there now. However, theBose SoundLink Flex (2nd gen)tops our list. While this is a great pick, there are others worth considering like theSoundcore by Anker Boom 2,Bose SoundLink MaxandTribit StormBox Flowalong with the newBeats Pill. Over 20 years of evaluating audio products, I've tested hundreds of Bluetooth speakers, and have had hands-on experience with all the speakers on this list and fully reviewed many of them. Some of the speakers on this list of best Bluetooth speakers are fairly pricey premium models, I've also included several budget picks, some of which cost less than $50. In our testing, we evaluate sound quality, battery life and design, including a speaker's water-resistance rating and durability. We also take into account how good a value the speaker is at its given price. I've recently added theTribit Stormbox Blast 2,Soundcore by Anker Select Go 4,Bose SoundLink Home,Bose SoundLink Max,Ultimate Ears EverboomandTribit XSound Plus 2. When the SoundLink Flex speaker launched, Bose made some bold claims about its new Bluetooth speaker, particularly its bass performance. But it mostly lived up to the hype and is arguably the best-sounding wireless speaker for its compact size. A second-gen model quietly arrived in October 2024 that adds a few new features, including a new customizable shortcut button, Bose app compatibility (you can now tweak the sound profile with an equalizer and create a SimpleSync connection with another compatible Bose product) and support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs. It's also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 4.2. While those aren't major upgrades, they do make an excellent portable Bluetooth speaker slightly better. The second-gen SoundLink Flex is available in black, blue dusk, sandstone and a new alpine sage color. Like the original, it's equipped with Bose's PositionIQ technology to automatically detect the speaker's orientation and deliver optimized sound based on whether it's upright, hanging or flat on its back. SCORE The Beats Pill has improved in some key ways from its predecessor, particularly when it comes to sound quality, durability, battery life and price point. I do like the form factor and lighter weight of the Bose SoundLink Flex. But the Pill does have a few extras like USB-C audio wired mode and speakerphone functionality that are appealing. You'll have to decide how important those extras are when weighing the Pill against the Bose SoundLink Flex. But any way you look at it, the Pill is a very good compact Bluetooth speaker. Like the Bose, it's an easy portable wireless speaker to recommend, especially if its price dips by $20 to $30, as the SoundLink Flex's price sometimes does during flash sales. SCORE The Soundcore by Anker Select Go 4 doesn't have quite the build quality as JBL's Go 4 micro Bluetooth speaker (it has a slight budget feel to it), but it offers comparable sound quality and costs half the price. Like the JBL Go 4, the similarly named Select Go 4 sounds decent for its tiny size and is able to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Also, it's fully waterproof and even floats. Battery life is rated for an impressive 20 hours at moderate volumes and you can pair two of these speakers together for stereo sound. It's definitely a good value. The JBL Clip 5 has a redesigned carabiner with a ""bigger and more accessible opening, making it easier to clip on anywhere."" In my tests, the speaker ended up sounding slightly better than its predecessor, which JBL says is due to the fact that the increased driver power allows for more ""streamlined sound and consistent bass at every volume."" Battery life is rated at 12 hours at moderate volume levels, and the speaker is equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with LE audio capabilities. It's IP67 waterproof and dustproof and has JBL Portable app support along with multi-speaker connectivity via Auracast. It's available in several color options. SCORE UE used to make a discus-like speaker called the Roll that floated in water. That model was discontinued but the new Miniroll is even more compact and delivers impressive sound for its size, putting out a little more bass than you'd expect. With up to 12 hours of battery at moderate volume levels, the speaker has a built-in strap that allows you to hook it onto anything from a branch to your bike's handlebars to the shoulder strap on your backpack. It's fully waterproof with an IP67 rating and has a Bluetooth range of up to 40 meters. It's also dust-resistant. While you can link up multiple Minirolls in PartyUp mode, I think most people would be happy with just one. It's one of the best-sounding micro Bluetooth speakers out there. SCORE The best way to describe Bose's new SoundLink Home speaker is as the spiritual successor to the SoundLink Mini 2, which was quietly discontinued in late 2018. Available in two color options, the SoundLink Home is a portable Bluetooth speaker with up to 9 hours of battery life, but it has more of an indoor design, with an aluminum chassis and no water resistance (you can move it around but it's not a speaker you'd take to the beach or take camping). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and weighing slightly more than 2 pounds, it's able to deliver an impressive amount of bass sound for its compact size. Overall, it sounds excellent for a mini Bluetooth speaker, featuring decent clarity and bigger sound than the SoundLink Flex. However, like any small speaker, it does have its sound limitations (if you push the volume up with certain tracks, it can sound a bit restrained in certain frequencies as its digital processing seeks to prevent distortion). Pairing two of these speakers together as a stereo pair does produce significantly better sound and you can link the speaker directly to a computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C cable for wired sound (it does sound slightly better in wired USB-C mode). On a more critical note, it's somewhat expensive and doesn't link to Bose's companion app for headphones and other Bluetooth speakers, so you can't tweak the sound profile. SCORE Back in 2020, Tribit released the StormBox Micro, a budget version of Bose's excellent SoundLink Micro speaker that delivered surprisingly good sound for its size and modest price. Now we get the StormBox Micro 2, which offers improved sound and battery life, along with a charge-out feature that turns the speaker into a power bank for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. An integrated strap allows you to clip it to your backpack or your bike's handlebars. Like the original, it's an excellent value and easy to recommend if you're looking for a super compact portable wireless speaker. SCORE Tribit's StormBox Flow is another Bose SoundLink Flex knockoff for less that shares some similarities with the Soundcore Motion 300, including the same list price. The Tribit may actually sound slightly better than the Motion 300, edging it out for bass performance by a tad. But the Anker speaker wins on design. Like the SoundLink Flex, the Tribit StormBox Flow can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up. You can also wirelessly pair two of the speakers together for stereo sound. It has an IP67 water-resistance rating, which means it's dust-resistant and fully waterproof. Tribit says it delivers up to 30 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. That's impressive. Bose's excellentSoundLink Flex Bluetooth speakersells for around $150 and sometimes goes on sale for less. The Soundcore Motion 300 is Anker's answer to that Bose speaker. Around the same size as the Bose, it doesn't sound quite as good, but it sounds impressive for its compact size and costs only $80. Like the SoundLink Flex, the Motion 300 can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up toward the ceiling (or sky), or propped up as shown in the photo above. It's IPX7 waterproof and delivers up to 13 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. There's also support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android and other devices that support Bluetooth wireless streaming with LDAC. The speaker has a bass boost button that does amp up the low end a bit. But I actually thought the speaker sounded a bit better without the bass boost engaged, because it seemed slightly overdriven with the boost on. The bass just doesn't sound that tight at higher volumes. That's where the Bose does better. SCORE The fourth-generation of JBL's smallest Bluetooth speaker not only has an upgraded design, but it delivers slightly better sound and significantly better battery life -- up to 7 hours versus the JBL Go 3's 5 hours at moderate volume levels. The speaker can only deliver so much sound for its tiny size (don't get your expectation up to high), but it sounds better than you think given just how small it is (it truly fits in a pocket) and manages to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Available in multiple color options, the speaker is also durable and has an IP67 water-resistance rating, which means it can survive being fully submerged in water and is also dust-proof. All in all, it's one of thetop micro Bluetooth speakersout there. SCORE The very compact Soundcore Mini 3 Bluetooth speaker by Anker may not deliver huge sound but it delivers more sound  than you'd think (with just enough bass) from a speaker of its size. Available in multiple color options and weighing around 8 ounces or 223 grams, it has an integrated strap and is fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. The 6-watt Mini 3 sounds fairly similar to the newSony SRS-XB100, which retails for $60 or around $20 more, and features good battery life -- up to 15 hours at moderate volume levels. You can wirelessly link multiple Mini 3s together to create a wider sound field, but most people will use this speaker for casual listening on the go. It also makes for a good bathroom or shower speaker and does have speakerphone capabilities with a built-in microphone.  For 2023, Sony's smallest Bluetooth speaker has once again been modestly upgraded, with a new Bluetooth chipset and slightly improved sound and speakerphone performance. This portable Bluetooth speaker is both dust- and waterproof with an IP67 certification and, like its predecessor (the SRS-XB13), it's rated for 16 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and it charges via USB-C. Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with support for the AAC and SBC audio codecs, the speaker plays bigger than you'd think for its small size, with some punch to its bass. It's pretty impressive for a mini mono speaker. Although the 9.6-ounce (272-gram) speaker appears to have the same design as the XB13, Sony says its new sound diffusion processor ""realizes richer spread sound,"" which basically means this has a bit wider soundstage, which I can confirm. It can output only so much sound -- yes, it has its limitations -- but if you add a second XB100, you can get stereo sound. Alas, there's no companion app, but that isn't a huge deal. The XB100 is available in multiple color options and includes a strap so you can attach it to various objects. It also has speakerphone capabilities with an integrated microphone (as I said, the speakerphone's performance has been improved, and callers said they could hear me clearly indoors). SCORE The Tribit XSound Plus 2 is the successor to the similarly priced MaxSound Plus, which was a very good value. The XSound Plus 2 plays a little louder (it has 30W vs. 24W power rating) and also has a little better battery (up to 24 hours at 50% volume vs. 20 hours). Additionally, this speaker is equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and is able to connect to the Tribit app and link up in party mode with Tribit's XSound Plus 2, StormBox Flow and StormBox 2 Bluetooth speakers. The speaker, which weighs in at 1.28 pounds, does play quite loud for its size and delivers an ample amount of bass. And while the sound can be a bit uneven (the speaker sounds very good with some tracks and a little brash with others), you can tweak the sound profile with some EQ settings, including three preset sound modes built into the speaker itself. Overall, the speaker seems pretty durable and has a removable lanyard and an IPX7 rating, which means it's fully waterproof. It does have speakerphone capabilities as well as an auxiliary input. With each new version of the Flip, JBL makes small improvements, and while the latest model -- the Flip 6 -- doesn't look much different from the Flip 5 on the outside, it does feature improved sound. It has two-way drivers with a woofer and tweeter and dual passive radiators that help the Flip 6 deliver much deeper bass than you think it could. It's fully waterproof and dustproof with an IP67 rating. Like the Flip 5, it's rated for up to 12 hours of audio playback at moderate volume levels and charges via USB-C. Available in multiple color options, it's one of the best-sounding speakers for its compact size. SCORE At around $30, the Tribit XSound Go is one of the top speakers with Bluetooth connectivity for the money. Besides sounding decent, it's also fully waterproof. It also has excellent battery life -- up to 24 hours at 50% volume levels. SCORE We liked Ultimate Ears'Wonderboom 2and the third-generation model, the Wonderboom 3, offers some small improvements, including slightly better battery life (up to 14 hours instead of 13, at moderate volume levels) and a new Bluetooth chip that allows for extended wireless range of over 130 feet (40 meters). The design has not changed, although the speaker now comes in different color options. Like its predecessor, the Wonderboom 3 carries a list price of $100 but sometimes sells for a little less. Its IP67 rating means that it's not only waterproof but also dust-proof (and able to float). This model retains the special Outdoor Boost mode that boosts treble and you can link two together (or pair a Wonderboom 3 to a Wonderboom 2) to create a stereo sound pairing by simply pressing a button on each speaker. As far as I can tell, the Wonderboom 3 sounds very similar to the Wonderboom 2 and features very good sound for its small size. That said, while there's some punch to the bass (being short yet squat helps it produce more low-end), it can only deliver so much kick. Alas, Ultimate Ears, which is owned by Logitech, has not upgraded the charging port to USB-C. The speaker still charges with a Micro-USB cable, which is a bit of a bummer. SCORE Marshall's little mono Willen speaker is similar to Bose's SoundLink Micro and other micro speakers like the Tribit StormBox Micro 2. Also like those speakers, it has an integrated strap on its base so you can clip it onto a backpack or even to your bike's handlebars. Its 2-inch full range driver and two passive radiators put out more sound than you'd think it would for its tiny size, and it offers decent clarity as well just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny (you can choose from three preset sound modes). Battery life is good at around 15 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels, and the speaker is IP67 dust-proof and waterproof. The main strike against it is its $120 price -- ideally it would cost around $80. But it's nicely designed, feels rugged and fits in a jacket pocket, weighing in at 0.68-pound (308 grams). The Willen can stand up vertically or lay down horizontally and has a built-in microphone for speakerphone calls. It comes in a couple of color options and can be linked wirelessly with other Willen speakers to augment the sound. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new portable Bluetooth speaker. Value-priced wireless speakers continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" portable Bluetooth speakers from Chinese brands like Tribit for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for a more premium speaker, you can expect to pay $100 or more, especially for larger portable speakers that deliver better sound. Bigger speakers tend to sound better, delivering a bigger sound with more bass. Going bigger means they weigh more, which can make them a little harder to carry around. So you have to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. If you're interested in a larger portable speaker, one feature worth looking out for is a built-in handle or shoulder strap perfect for your pool party or beach trip. Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, having a more durable speaker is a desirable trait. Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. Many speakers don't offer that feature, so choose accordingly if that's something you're looking for. CNET follows a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process for all of our audio testing. Our audio lab includes aRoon serverrunning on a Synology NAS, Google Nest and Amazon Echo speakers, plus both iOS and Android devices. Similar speakers are compared side by side in a living room environment with different styles of music and utilizing multiple streaming platforms when required. We grade the sound quality of each by evaluating clarity, dynamics, bass response and stereo imaging (if applicable). If the speaker comes with a proprietary app we will compare that to other competitive controllers. In assessing what the best Bluetooth speakers are, we consider the design of the speaker and how durable it seems, along with sound quality, battery life, extra features (such as additional connectivity options) and overall value. We test speakers in real-life environments both indoors and outdoors and compare it to other speakers in the same price range. We assess the design and build quality of the speakers and how they connect to your device's sound card, whether by Bluetooth alone or via a connecting cord for manual audio input. We also test the Bluetooth range to see how far you can take your device without the speaker disconnecting. Color options, size and overall aesthetic appeal are more superficial aspects we take into consideration. We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks. We also watch some movies and play some games with notable sound effects to capture the full range of the audio experience, whether mono or stereo audio. Some portable Bluetooth speakers offer extra connectivity options like Wi-Fi or an optical port for a digital connection or surround sound for a fuller audio experience. Others include a ""party mode"" for multi-device connection or light shows, especially enticing for larger events. With the rise of universal cables, we also highlight those with a USB-C charging port for easy charging. We determine value after evaluating the strength of the portable Bluetooth speakers against all these criteria and what the speakers are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. JBL Pulse 5: JBL's Pulse speaker is now in its fifth generation, and both the sound quality and 360-degree light show have been improved. JBL has ""expanded the transparent outer body"" so the customizable light show looks more impressive. (There's a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to alter the colorful lighting effects.) The speaker is also IP67 dust-proof and waterproof, and it offers up to 12 hours of battery at moderate volume levels. If you're looking for more information on the newest launch, check out ourfirst look of the JBL Pulse 5. Tribit StormBox: The StormBox looks like a cross between a UE and a JBL speaker. We suspect that's not an accident. This fully waterproof speaker costs significantly less than the JBL Flip 5 and Flip 6 and produces a bigger sound. Its rechargeable battery offers up to 20 hours of battery life for playing music and more.Tribit's XSound speakersare probably a better value, but the StormBox is more stylish. Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen): A couple of years ago, Bang & Olufsen upgraded its dome-shaped aluminum-clad A1 speaker with improved battery life, better speakerphone performance (it now has a three-microphone array) and slightly improved sound. It's not only the smallest wireless speaker from the Danish company, it's technically the most affordable. The speaker has some great features for the price that you can learn more about in ourBang & Olufsen Beosound A1 review. Bose SoundLink Micro: Although a little pricey and due to be upgraded, the Bose SoundLink Micro sounds remarkably decent for its tiny size, delivering more bass than other pocketable speakers. It's a fully waterproof Bluetooth speaker and is available in three color options, although the blue version appears to be hard to find. Check out ourfull review of Bose's SoundLink Micro speakerhere. Anker Soundcore Motion Plus: Anker's Soundcore Motion Plus came out in 2019, but it remains one of the best-sounding speakers for around $100. It's larger than many mini Bluetooth speakers, but it's still compact. It manages to sound quite a bit fuller than much of the competition in its price range, with bigger bass, more volume and better clarity. It's also fully waterproof (IPX7-rated) and has support for the aptX streaming codec for devices like Samsung's Galaxy phones that support it. The speaker is packed full of other features that we talk about in ourAnker SoundCore Motion Plus review. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore: While it's a little overpriced for the sound quality it delivers, the Beosound Explore is a very good little speaker that has a sleek, eye-catching design, is fully waterproof and dustproof (IP67 rating), and offers excellent battery life, with up to 27 hours of music listening at moderate volume levels. When choosing a Bluetooth speaker, what it really comes down to is size and price. If you're looking for a very portable speaker, you'll want to get something very compact, but remember that smaller speakers usually produce less sound and bass than larger ones. While there are plenty of mini Bluetooth speakers that deliver a bigger sound than you might expect, they do have their sonic limitations. For a lot of people, it's a question of finding a speaker that's not too big or too small -- one that travels well but also is capable of producing good sound for its size. But finding the best portable Bluetooth speaker also comes down to your budget. Price can be a limiting factor. You may not want to spend $150 or more for a small speaker. Luckily, there are plenty of good options for $100, and some decent mini Bluetooth speakers can cost less than $50. Also, certain ""value"" brands that sell primarily on Amazon are strongly worth considering because they do offer a lot for the money. If you're looking for the best sound quality, as I said, bigger is usually better, and some larger portable Bluetooth speakers -- sometimes referred to as Bluetooth boom boxes -- can put out a lot of sound and have an integrated handle for toting them around. The loudest Bluetooth speakers are the biggest ones. Sometimes they're referred to as boom boxes or ""party"" speakers. Some of those speakers are portable and have built-in rechargeable batteries while the biggest party speakers literally have wheels on them for transport and need to be plugged in with an AC adapter because they require so much power. We have alist of the best wireless boom box speakersif you're looking for a bigger Bluetooth speaker. It's also worth noting that Bluetooth speakers from the same company can be daisy-chained together to augment their sound or paired together as a left-right stereo pair. Often, the best way to get a bigger sound is to pair two Bluetooth speakers together in a stereo pair. Mini Bluetooth speakers are increasingly being made waterproof, which means they can be fully submerged in water. A few models even float. For full waterproofing, look for an IPX rating of IPX7 or higher. Sometimes speakers will also have a dust-resistance rating. For example, an IP68 speaker is fully dust-proof and fully waterproof. The first number is the dust-resistance rating while the second refers to water resistance. So a speaker with an IP68 rating has the same water-resistance rating as an IPX8-rated speaker. Both can be termed as wireless speaker systems. Wi-Fi delivers the same basic convenience as Bluetooth: using your phone's Wi-Fi connection to play music over an external speaker or sound system. Just like speakers that use Bluetooth connectivity, it can work with a subscription music service app such asSpotify(via Spotify Connect) orApple Music, a radio service likePandoraor TuneIn, or your own music collection. Here are the best reasons to get a streaming Wi-Fi speaker:","If you like to travel with your sound, these are the best portable Bluetooth speakers we've tested -- and some even fit in your pocket.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-portable-mini-bluetooth-speaker/,
371,Best Noise-Canceling Headphones for 2024,"What to consider Budget Value can reflect quality. Consider your needs and what your budget allows. Fit (Comfort) Ensuring the headphones you choose fit your head help minimize any discomfort from extended wear. Durability Sturdy quality help ensure your headphones hold up well over time. vs   I’ve been testing noise-canceling headphones for around 15 years and have put together this list of top noise-canceling models at a variety of prices. Most selections on this list are full-size over-ear headphones, but I’ve included some true wireless earbuds for those who prefer them. If you're looking for budget-friendly options, take a look at our list of thebest noise-canceling headphones under $100. We also have a list ofbest noise-canceling true wireless earbuds. What to consider Budget Value can reflect quality. Consider your needs and what your budget allows. Fit (Comfort) Ensuring the headphones you choose fit your head help minimize any discomfort from extended wear. Durability Sturdy quality help ensure your headphones hold up well over time. While Bose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. All that adds up to the best new noise-canceling headphones of 2024 and a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max. SCORE When you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case forSony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher price tag, most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance, as well as even better noise-canceling and more refined sound. SCORE Several years in development, Sonos' new Ace headphones are finally available. They're mostly very impressive, though they aren't without a few downsides, including a rather high price tag and some potential glitches with a key feature. But overall they're very well designed and also deliver top-notch sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. SCORE QCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads. The sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones. You do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. That said, the H3 Pro are all in all a very good value, particularly when their price dips closer to $50. While the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. And a natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit. SCORE When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. And at $300 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly too. But overall they're really impressive -- easily among the very top earbuds on the market. SCORE Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Pro. Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE Sony's improved entry-level noise canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. But they sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these should see significant discounts in the not-so-distant future, which is what you may want to wait for. SCORE The W830NB is the successor to Edifier's popular W820NB Plus, one of the better value noise-canceling headphones of the last few years. The W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, and the like that earlier model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory-foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android. The W830NB do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB support the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing, however. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included but most computers and smartphones have USB-C now). Earfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the 20%-off instant coupon on their product page and add the codeEWPROCNETat checkout and the price drops to $56.While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less. They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable connection for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer). The well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening. Love 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as a wired headphone back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read ourfull reviewto find out what makes this a very good headphone with some caveats. SCORE Apple has updated the AirPods Max with USB-C charging -- instead of Lightning -- and added new color options but didn't upgrade the headphones in any other ways that we're aware of. Note that the Lightning model is being discounted as its phased out of the market, but we should soon see discounts on the USB-C model. Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver impressive sound quality, excellent noise canceling, as well as premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature with head tracing. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. SCORE In 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, new for 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Even though it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras. When I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're a very solid midrange headphone that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200. Sennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors. The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that ""assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste."" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offer ""best-in-class"" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.  SCORE When Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance. As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products ""visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language."" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to ""help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing."" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than that in 2024 -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can readour review of the QuietComfort 45to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones. SCORE The ULT Wear (WH-ULT900N) is the successor to Sony's popular extra bass model, the WH-XB910N, and features upgraded drivers (better sound) along with improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance. Both Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 and entry-level CH-720N offer more balanced sound, but the ULT Wear deliver on their promise of delivering dynamic, powerful sound with deep bass. The only downside is that bass can get sometimes get a little too boomy, especially when you engage the bass boost mode with the ULT button. SCORE Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. And now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the ""e"" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been retuned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip. These headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. But the PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more. The JBL Tune 670NC is one of a relatively small number of on-ear headphones to offer active noise canceling. It's something of a value model -- no carrying case is included -- but it does have memory foam ear pads that get you a comfortable fit for an on-ear headphone. Deliver clear sound with punch bass, it has 32mm drivers and improves on its predecessor's battery life, offering up to a whopping 70 hours (or 44 hours with ANC on), and an extra three hours of battery with just five minutes of charge. This model includes the latest Bluetooth 5.3 (with LE Audio) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. It also has JBL's Ambient Aware (transparency mode) and TalkThru features. It's available in black, white and blue and comes with a cord for wired listening. The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4. They're a bit generic looking but sleek enough and more importantly, comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. While it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a step down from what Sony and Bose models offer but it does a decent job of muffling ambient sound and there is a transparency mode. Voice-calling performance is similarly solid but unspectacular. Note that you can use this in wired mode with the included cable but the noise canceling only works in wireless mode, which is an issue for frequent flyers who like some noise canceling when plugging into an in-flight entertainment system. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new ANC headphones. The quality of value-priced noise canceling headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. But the premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more. It's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over the course of a day with minimal breaks. You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. You want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise-canceling, call quality, and features for whatever you're able to spend. It's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one. We test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria. These criteria includedesign,sound quality,noise-canceling performance,voice-calling performance, featuresandvalue. Google Pixel Buds Pro: The Pixel Buds Pro are Google's first earbuds to feature active noise canceling. While it's nice that they finally have a feature that a lot of true-wireless earbuds have had for a while, what ultimately sets the Pixel Buds Pro apart and makes them worth considering -- particularly for Android users -- is their distinct design and winning fit. That helps enhance their performance on both the sound quality and noise-canceling fronts. While not quite elite for voice-calling, they also performed well as a headset for making calls. Read ourGoogle Pixel Buds Pro review. Soundcore by Anker Space One: Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45. Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users. Shure Aonic 50: A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the 2nd-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours (they now have a quick-charge feature) and also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 a top noise-canceling headphone. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They feature excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure call them a ""studio headphone,"" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference). Mark Levinson No. 5909: The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. But they're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headband. Read ourMark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on. Focal Bathys: French audio companyFocalis known for its high-end speaker systems and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. These $699 cans sound fantastic and are great overall but their noise-canceling is fairly light, so don't buy them for their ANC. Master & Dynamic MW09 (Update: Out of Stock): Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds, but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to battery life and noise canceling (it's now very close to what Bose and Sony offer, though not quite at their level for ANC). Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise canceling along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. That said, their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices. Beats Studio Buds Plus: Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. Beats Fit Pro: While the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensiveStudio Budsandnew-for-2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of theAirPods Pro'sfeatures, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. Technics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback but the headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail (however, they take a day or two to break in). Technics EAH-AZ80: Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, good noise canceling and a robust feature set. A few years ago, you had to pay significantly more money for active noise-cancelling headphones. But the feature has become pretty common and while the best noise-cancelling headphones (by that I mean the headphones that offer the best noise canceling) tend to be fairly expensive, you can find cheaper models that offer decent noise cancellation. I do think that if noise canceling is important to you, it's better to spend more money on the best pair of noise-cancelling headphones you can afford. And it's worth noting that many of the premium models get discounted sporadically during the year so you can often save $50 or more on many top headphones if you time your purchase right. Either spelling is correct, as ""canceling"" is more common inAmerican Englishwhile ""cancelling"" is more common in British English. CNET uses ""noise canceling"" since the company is based in the US, but the noise is canceled just the same, regardless of spelling. If you're looking to see what different noise-impacting technology is out there for headphones, check out our article onnoise-canceling versus noise-isolating headphones, which highlights differences in function (and not just a difference in spelling). Noise-cancelling headphones have traditionally been good at blocking out lower frequency sounds such as the rumbling you hear while traveling on a plane. They haven't been so good at muffling higher frequencies (a baby screaming, for example) and even people talking around you. But companies like Bose, Sony and Apple have improved the technology in the last year or two so their noise canceling works across a wider frequency range with a greater frequency response. It still can't muffle all noise but top noise canceling is now doing a better job tamping down more noises that live in midrange and higher frequencies. When noise canceling is engaged, it does tend to have an impact on battery life. This is more of a factor with earbuds, which tend to offer anywhere from five to eight hours of battery life with noise canceling on and seven to 12 hours with it off. Full-size headphones can offer 25 to 30 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and up to 40 to 50 hours with it off. Active noise cancellation does have an adverse effect on sound quality, especially if the noise canceling isn't all that good (noise canceling can create a faint background hiss). It can mess with the purity of the sound quality so it's tricky to create a noise-canceling headphone that sounds really good. As a result, often high-end noise-canceling headphones that tout fantastic sound quality don't have as powerful noise canceling (the noise canceling feels lighter). Yes, you can use both audio features at the same time. While you won't need special headphones to play Dolby Atmos -- just a Dolby Atmos-enabled device and audio -- noise cancelling headphones can add an even more space, clarity, and depth to your audio experience that rivals the surround sound experienced in ahome theater system. Some noise-cancelling headphones are at least water-resistant, with IP ratings of around IPX4. However, many over- and on-ear noise-cancelling headphones are not waterproof, as is expected for their model (most over- and on-ear headphones are not waterproof). If you're looking for noise-cancelling headphones to use in the rain, we recommend looking at earbuds rather than headphones, like the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Apple AirPods, or the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds.",Ready to enjoy your music without distractions?

Picking the best wireless headphones isn't exactly easy, but we've selected theBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphonesas the best wireless headphones, thanks to their excellent noise cancellation and sound quality. The market is flooded with wireless headphones, with a lot of features and wear styles available. You get the over-the-head headphones, as well as in-ear wireless earbuds and neckband earphones. There's a wide range of sound quality settings and smart options, typically available across a wide range of budgets. Noise-cancelling headphones are also pretty common now, with some featuring active noise cancellation. Heavy hitters like Bose and Apple headphones come with hefty price tags. At the same time, there are brands that are making exceptional wireless headphones on a budget. In this list, we've included a combination of some of the biggest names in the market, as well as some more budget-friendly options that will give a great listening experience. Bose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. All that adds up to the best new noise-canceling headphones of 2024 and a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max. SCORE When you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $400 retail price, most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance as well as even better noise canceling and more refined sound. SCORE Sennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors. The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that ""assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste."" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offer ""best-in-class"" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.  SCORE Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Pro. Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE Sony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. They do sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe, but the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these have already seen significant discounts, with prices dropping to as low as $100 during flash sales. SCORE Love 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max, but that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. Read ourfull reviewto find out what makes these good-quality headphones, albeit with some caveats. SCORE Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony and works very well as a headset for making calls. I wouldn't recommend them for Android and Windows users, they're the best wireless headphones for iOS and Mac users who want to switch easily between their Apple devices. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market, along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. They're heavy, but they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. The well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening. In 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, new for 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Even though it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras. When I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're a very solid midrange headphone that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200. The W830NB is the successor to Edifier's popular W820NB Plus, one of the better value noise-canceling headphones of the last few years. The W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, and the like that earlier model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory-foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android. The W830NB do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB support the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing, however. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included but most computers and smartphones have USB-C now). The QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. A natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit. SCORE Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. Now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the ""e"" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been re-tuned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip. These headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious with its sturdy design and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sells a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more. In a nutshell, the Beats Solo 4 on-ear headphones have pretty much the same look on the outside as the 3s, but some notable improvements on the inside bump their performance by about 25% to 30% when it comes to sound quality, battery life and voice-calling. Would I pay $200 for them? No, I wouldn't. But if you look at what's happened with the Studio Pro's pricing -- they're sporadically discounted to $200 or $150 off their list price and even dropped to $180 for Prime Day -- the Solo 4s won't always be $200. I'm certain we'll see them fairly soon for what the Solo 3s now cost, which is around $130. They make a lot more sense at that price, particularly if you're looking for a more compact on-ear headphone and don't need active noise canceling. SCORE Sony released its new entry-level CH-720N noise-canceling headphones in 2023. They're quite good, but if you can't afford them (they list for around $100), the company's new budget on-ear CH-520 headphones are an intriguing option for only around $40. They lack noise canceling and are pretty no-frills, but they feature good sound for their price, are lightweight and pretty comfortable for on-ear headphones, and also have excellent battery life (they're rated for up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). Additionally, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with two devices simultaneously (such as a smartphone and computer) and switch audio. Voice-calling performance is decent, although not up to the level of what you get with the CH-720N. Note that there's no wired option -- this is a wireless Bluetooth-only headphone. The CH-520 offers an overall balanced sound with decent clarity. The bass has some punch to it but doesn't pack a wallop, and you're not going to get quite as wide a soundstage as you get from Sony's more expensive over-ear headphones. These sound much better than Sony's previous entry-level on-ear headphones -- even better than I thought they would. Earfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the 20%-off instant coupon on their product page and add the codeEWPROCNETat checkout and the price drops to $56.While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less. They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer). When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. They're excellent, but we had some quibbles: They're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite, and they're also costly. Overall they're really impressive; easily among the very top earbuds on the market. SCORE Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless headphones. The quality of value-priced headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more, sometimes much more. The majority of over-ear headphones feature active noise canceling. It does slightly affect sound quality, so if you're an audio purist, you may want to go with a model that doesn't have noise canceling. You can also sometimes save some money by getting non-ANC headphones, although noise canceling is becoming a fairly standard feature. It's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over a day with minimal breaks. You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. You will want great headphones with the best noise canceling, sound quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. It's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. We test wireless headphones based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value. Mark Levinson No. 5909: These are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones, and yes, they're really expensive at $999. They're also really good. They have a sturdy design without feeling hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy), and they're comfortable to wear over long periods, thanks to their nicely padded and replaceable leather-covered earcups and headbands. Read ourMark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on. Soundcore by Anker Space One: The Space One is a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sounds respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measures up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45. Technics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800, and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback, but these headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic, great sound with powerful bass and good detail, although they take a day or two to break in. Status Between 3ANC: Status earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you're getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, but they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me. Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds. Learn more about theUltra Open Earbuds here. In the past, top full-size wireless headphones did offer improved performance over wireless earbuds. That's no longer the case. Some top wireless earbuds measure up well to full-size models for both sound quality, noise-canceling performance and call quality. Over-ear headphones do have big battery life advantages. Only if you play them too loud for long periods. It's best to keep volume levels in the 50% to 70% range. Lighter headphones tend to be more comfortable, and companies like Sony and Bose have made an effort to shave as much weight as they can off their premium over-ear noise-canceling headphones. You also want headphones that have soft earpads and a comfortable headband, with high-quality memory foam and good padding. Heavier headphones, like Apple's AirPods Max, can be comfortable, but the weight distribution has to be good, along with the cushioning on the headband at the top where it meets the crown of your head. Short answer: both. Either spelling is correct, as ""canceling"" is more common inAmerican English, while ""cancelling"" is more common in British English. CNET uses ""noise-canceling"" since the company is based in the US, but the noise is canceled just the same, regardless of spelling.

373,Best 65-Inch TV of 2024,"What to consider Price TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Screen size Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. Capability Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality. When you're buying a TV, we always say go big if you have the space for it. A 65-inch TV might seem excessive in size, but I consider it the ""sweet spot"" for most living rooms. It's not too big to crowd or dominate the space, and it offers an immersive watching and gaming experience. Plus, it's one of the most common and popular TV sizes out there, so you've got plenty of options to choose from. To help you find the best 65-inch TV for your living room and your budget, I've rounded up some of the overall best models on the market. Plus, as 2024 TVs are available now, many of their 2023 versions are on sale -- and have most of the same features. What to consider Price TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Screen size Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. Capability Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality. After testing many of the best TVs for the money, my favorite 65-inch TV for most people this year is theTCL QM8 series (2023). The QM8 offers superb picture quality overall, all the features you need in a modern television -- including4K/120Hz input and variable refresh ratethat can get the most out of consoles like thePS5andXbox Series X-- and an affordable price tag. When a friend asks me what 65-inch TV to buy, I tell them the TCL QM8 series. Plenty of other excellent choices are available, especially if you want a TV smaller than 65 inches. Although the QM8 is my current favorite for most people, it might not be right for your preferences or budget. For every price point, keep in mind that the holiday shopping season brings about majorCyber Monday TV dealsand discounts you may want to take advantage of. TCL has topped our list of the best TVs for the last few years but the QM8 is something different, and even better than before. In my comparison tests, it stood out with superior brightness and impact while still maintaining excellent contrast; a combination no other TV could match at this price. The key ismini-LED techand well-implementedfull-array local dimming. It also has a sleek design with a center-mount stand. The operating system is Google TV, which I don't like as much as Roku TV, but it's still a solid smart TV. This model replaces the TCL 6-Series Roku TV from last year. If you're looking for the best TV for the money and the TCL QM8 is significantly more expensive at the time you read this, the Hisense U8K should be your go-to. I compared the two 2023 TVs side-by-side, and while I liked the QM8 just a bit better, the U8K is an excellent choice as well. Both offer superb image quality and affordable prices thanks to mini-LED backlights and full-array local dimming, as well as similar gaming features and the Google TV operating system. Both cost hundreds less than you'd have to pay to get similar image quality from a better-known brand. The C3 represents better picture quality thanany non-OLED TVon this list at a price that's definitely higher, but still not stratospheric. Its perfect black levels, unbeatable contrast and superb off-angle viewing kept it a notch above the mini-LED models in my comparison tests, and while its overall brightness isn't quite as impressive, it's still an incredible performer in all kinds of room lighting. The C3 is also one of the lightest TVs we've ever reviewed thanks to its carbon-fiber construction; the 65-inch version weighs just 37 pounds with its stand. In 2023 we awarded theG3the title of the best TV for picture quality, and this year's version, the G4, is even better. In our side-by-side comparisons it beat its predecessor in brightness and overall image quality with the kind of jaw-dropping images you can only get from a topflight OLED TV. In a bright room, the G4 fell short of the performance of its direct competitor, the SamsungS95D, which is the best TV for picture quality that we've seen this year. The Samsung uses an all-new matte screen finish, which in our tests did a better job fighting reflections than the more typical glossy screen of the LG. The S95D's matte finish has its downside, namely a reduction in contrast, but overall we preferred its bright-room image quality over the G4's. The major caveat here is that both TVs performed well (and practically identically) in a dark room. So unless you routinely have a bright viewing environment, the G4 performs just as well as the S95D. The G4 also comes in significantly more sizes than the S95D, making it a more versatile option. Glare-free or not, here's where we mention that most TV viewers will be perfectly satisfied with something less expensive but still excellent, like the step-down LG C4 or amini-LED model. The G4 is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a high-performance television and is willing to pay for it. The picture quality of the TCL 4-Series Roku TV was a step behind the Vizio V-Series in ourbudget TV test, but the differences between the two are slight enough that you'd really have to have them set up side by side to notice anything at all. The 4-Series lacks Dolby Vision, Bluetooth connectivity and AMD FreeSync with a variable refresh rate, all of which the Vizio offers. The 4-Series' advantage over the Vizio is that it comes with the excellent Roku Smart TV system built in. That makes it a great choice for those looking for a one-stop smart TV solution, without having to add an external streaming device. Note that TCL has been selling the 4-Series for the last few years with little to no change in image quality or features in our tests. The Samsung S95D's matte finish does more than reduce reflections, it nearly eliminates them, improving image quality in bright rooms more than any OLED TV we've tested. Some non-OLED models have matte screens, but this is the first time they've been available in an OLED TV, a display technology that has always delivered thebest picture available. That matte finish really works, reducing windows and other glare to dimmer blobs instead of super-bright, mirror-like distractions. The S95D also has an external box, allowing for a cleaner look with the option to store HDMI connections and the power cord out of sight. Between its versatile matte screen and awesome picture overall, the Samsung S95D delivers the best image quality of any TV we've tested, beating both the G4 and last year's winner, theG3, as well as any other non-OLED TV. It also costs a ton, and most people -- even those with bright rooms -- will be perfectly happy with aless expensive TV. In our tests over the years, Vizio TVs have produced very good picture quality without breaking the bank. The Vizio Quantum Pro continues this trend and holds up as a solid midpriced TV option, with a few notable drawbacks. In side-by-side comparison tests in our lab, the Quantum Pro performed well for the money, with better contrast than the similarly pricedRoku Plus Series, for example. On the other hand, as expected, slightly more expensive models like theTCL QM8andHisense U8Kwere better, with brighter images and higher contrast. The Quantum Pro differs from Vizio's less expensive TVs by offering full-array local dimming, our favorite feature to improve LCD picture quality. It has somewhat more local dimming zones than the Vizio MQX we reviewed previously, but that won't necessarily make a big difference in image quality. The Quantum Pro also doesn't have mini-LED technology. Competition among TVs in the middle pricing band is heating up and the Plus Series is the latest entrant in 2023. Unlike the TCL Roku TVs higher on this list, this one is all Roku, with no other brands on board. It adds a couple of step-up extras, including QLED and full-array local dimming, which help deliver a better picture than the TCL 4-Series, for example. It's not as impressive as the Vizio MQX since it lacks 120Hz for gaming and has worse picture quality overall. If you value those extras, the Vizio is worth saving for, but if not the Roku Plus Series is a good value. This is the first TV Roku has produced under its own brand, as opposed to partnering with a brand like TCL, Sharp, Pioneer or Hisense. The company also released a version with fewer features and no local dimming, called theRoku Select Series. With all of the TVs available today, and all of the technical terms and jargon associated with television technology, it can be tough to figure out what's important. Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion. Price:TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Most entry-level TVs have a good enough picture for most people, but TVs last a long time, so it might be worth spending more to get a better picture. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower. Screen size:Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV and 65 inches or larger is best. Stepping up in TV screen size is a better use of your money than any feature. One of the most common complaints we've heard is from people who regret that they didn't go big enough when they bought a TV. We almost never hear people complain that their TV is too large. Capability:Among entry-level TVs the most important feature is what kind of smart TV system the TV uses. Among midrange models, look for a feature including full-array local dimming, mini-LED and 120Hz refresh rate, which (unlike some other extras) do help improve the picture in our experience. Among high-end TVs, OLED technology is your best bet. Our TV reviews follow a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process honed over nearly two decades of TV reviews. Our primary TV test lab has specialized equipment for measuring light and color, including aKonica Minolta CS-2000spectroradiometer, aMurideo Sig-G4K HDR signal generator and anAVPro Connect 8x84K HDR distribution matrix. We usePortrait Displays CalMan Ultimatesoftware to evaluate every TV we review. In every CNET TV review, three or more similar TVs are compared side by side in various lighting conditions playing different media, including movies, TV shows and games, across a variety of test categories, from color to video processing to gaming to HDR. Our reviews also account for design, features, smart TV performance, HDMI input and gaming compatibility, among other factors. One important aspect of image quality we test is overall brightness. Here's how it compares innitsacross select TVs listed above. Check outhow we test TVsfor more details. For more TV advice, check outour guide to buying a TV. It depends on your room size, seating distance and personal taste. For a standard living room or larger bedroom, a 65-inch TV is excellent, but for massive rooms,we recommend a larger TV, say a 75- or even 85-inch model, if you can afford it. If you sit closer to the screen you don't need as large a TV for the best experience. For maximum theatrical impact, according to THX and SMPTE, you should be between 6.5 and 9 feet from a 65-inch screen, although many viewers will find it more comfortable to sit a bit further back than that. Nearly every 65-inch TV has 4K resolution, and if you have 20/20 vision you can sit as close as about 4 feet and still not discern individual pixels. Most 65-inch TVsmeasure between 56 and 58 inches wide. Because the frames around newer TV screens are typically quite narrow, 65-inch TV widths don't vary much. Models with slim frames are on the lower end -- the 65-inch LG C3 measures 56.7 inches wide for example, while the thicker-framed 65-inch TCL 4-Series is 57.4 inches wide. If you're not planning to wall-mount the TV, you generally want the piece of furniture supporting the TV to measure at least as wide as the TV itself, and preferably a few inches wider. Refer to the manufacturer's website for the exact dimensions of a particular 65-inch TV. A 65-inch TV weighs between 37 and 75 pounds with its stand, but this varies significantly depending on the type of TV. Removing the stand -- which often consists of a pair of little legs under the panel -- allows you to wall-mount the TV and reduces its weight slightly (stands weigh between 1 and 8 pounds). Shipping weight (box, accessories, etc.) of 65-inch TVs ranges from 45 to 91 pounds. Refer to the manufacturer's website for the exact weights of a particular 65-inch TV.","Whether you're upgrading to a bigger TV or replacing a 65-inch model, these are the best TVs on the market right now.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-65-inch-tv/,
374,"Best Fire TV Stick for 2024: Fire Stick 4K, Lite and More","What to Consider Budget Before anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a Fire TV Stick. Higher-end models can cost up to $140, but there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective Fire TV Sticks which are priced as low as $20. Use cases Consider what exactly you'll be using your Fire TV Stick for and make sure it aligns with the capability of the model you choose. 4K and HDR Models like the Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick 4K and the 4K Max support and HDR protocols, while the Fire TV Stick Lite and standard Fire TV Stick do not. Alexa While all five Fire TV Stick models have Alexa integrations, the Fire TV Cube has some advanced modalities that may better suit your needs. Amazon has made a big splash in the streaming world with its Fire TV devices, ranging from the straightforward Fire TV Stick Lite to the feature-packed Fire TV Cube. We’ve tested these options (and everything in between) alongside offerings from Roku, Google and Apple. While Roku often wins us over with its easy-to-navigate, neutral platform, Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks shine for Alexa fans and those deep into the Amazon ecosystem. Choosing the right model might seem daunting, but we’ve got you covered. Whether you need something basic or a device that does it all, our guide to the best Fire TV Stick will help you pinpoint exactly what suits your streaming style and needs. What to Consider Budget Before anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a Fire TV Stick. Higher-end models can cost up to $140, but there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective Fire TV Sticks which are priced as low as $20. Use cases Consider what exactly you'll be using your Fire TV Stick for and make sure it aligns with the capability of the model you choose. 4K and HDR Models like the Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick 4K and the 4K Max support and HDR protocols, while the Fire TV Stick Lite and standard Fire TV Stick do not. Alexa While all five Fire TV Stick models have Alexa integrations, the Fire TV Cube has some advanced modalities that may better suit your needs. If you're looking for the best Fire Stick on the market, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is it. The Max is speedy and loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max supportsWi-Fi 6and nearly all the latest playback standards, includingDolby Vision. The downside to the Max is its Fire TV platform with ads featured prominently throughout. We just don't appreciate the TV becoming a giant rotating billboard for content or ads when in screensaver mode. But this is a good choice for those looking for the best and fastest Amazon Fire TV stick. SCORE The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed. The voice features are impressive and Echo and Dot owners can control it with Alexa. Its app and game selection is superb and responses are still fast, though not as fast as on the Max. The remote can control volume and power on TVs and soundbars. Ultimately, if the price of the Fire TV Stick 4K is close to the Max, we recommend passing on this and getting the newer and faster Max. The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting theRoku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is theExpress Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, the Lite is your best bet. The 2022 Fire TV Cube adds a handful of bells and whistles, including 4K upscaling and a faster processor, to a device that's been around for a while. The Cube has always been a mash-up of the Fire TV Stick and an Alexa speaker, allowing you to use your voice to search for shows and adjust the volume and inputs on your TV, dim lights, make Zoom calls (audio-only, unless you add a webcam), stream music and check the weather -- all hands-free, without using the remote. It also features an octa-core processor and 2GB of memory for lightning-fast streaming in 4K, as well as audio support for Dolby Atmos. That said, the latest version of the Cube has difficulty controlling devices connected to your TV -- especially if that TV happens to be a TCL -- and often misses the mark when integrating Alexa commands with your cable box. Although the Lite is a better value, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is another good choice for those who are still rocking regular HD TVs. The main difference between the Fire TV Stick and the cheaper Fire TV Stick Lite lies in the remote control. Fire Stick's remote has buttons for volume, mute and power, allowing you to control those functions on your TV. The Lite lacks these capabilities and is therefore slightly less expensive. If you have a 1080p TV and don't mind paying a little more for a remote that can control the volume on your TV, the Fire TV Stick is a good choice for you. Before anything else, consider how much you're willing to spend on a Fire TV Stick. Higher-end models can cost up to $140, like the impressive Fire TV Cube. But if your budget is tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet effective Fire TV Sticks priced as low as $20. The entry-level standard Fire TV Stick, for example, offers HD playback if your television is compatible. Plenty of options exist for a range of budgets and all your streaming needs. Consider what exactly you'll be using your Fire TV Stick for. Are you hoping to turn your TV into a smart TV,  or are you looking for extra services beyond what your smart TV already offers? Maybe you're hoping to use your Fire TV Stick to control your smart home technology. Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the Fire TV Stick you choose. Models like the Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick 4K and the 4K Max support 4K resolutions and HDR protocols, while the Fire TV Stick Lite and standard Fire TV Stick do not. If you're not too concerned about high-resolution streaming or your TV model doesn't support anything above 1080p, the latter models should suit your needs. Otherwise, you may want to opt for one of the 4K Sticks. All five Fire TV Stick models have remotes with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. But if you're looking for something a bit more advanced, the Fire TV Cube may be your best bet. That's because it's equipped with the full capabilities of a separate Alexa speaker, allowing you to use your TV hands-free, without a remote. Full Alexa integration also means that the Cube can control your smart-home gadgets, like lights and thermostats. While plain Fire Stick variants can also do this, they require a connection with a separate Amazon Echo speaker. If you're looking for an Alexa-speaker-streaming-device combination, you'd likely be happiest with the Fire TV Cube. If this isn't your top priority, or you already have an Echo speaker, one of the Fire TV Sticks will be fine. Every Fire TV Stick we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available and note how they stack up against other Fire TV models in the company's lineup. To do this, we hook up multiple Fire TV streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences. The metrics we use to rate a device include hardware design, distinctive features that differentiate models, remote capabilities and design, overall ease of use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance and the overall speed and reliability of the system. Roku Express 4K Plus: The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to theAirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall. Chromecast with Google TV 4K: Chromecast outdoes Roku by addingDolby Visioncompatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world. Apple TV 4K: The Apple TV 4K continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to useApple Arcadefor gaming or take full advantage of theirApple Onesubscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate itsflexible HDRandTV calibration feature. For most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price. Roku Streaming Stick 4K: The Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint. A Fire TV device, like the ones in this list, is a small stick-shaped or square piece of hardware that plugs into an HDMI port at the back of your TV. This gives your TV access to Amazon Fire TV software and content, no matter what brand of TV you own. Amazon also makesFire TVs, which are televisions that come with Fire TV software preinstalled. This means that your TV will automatically have access to the Fire TV interface without the need for an additional streaming device. Fire TV offers a long list of streaming apps, including Netflix, Disney Plus, Apple TV, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock TV, Tubi, Pluto TV, Showtime, Discovery Plus andothers. Spectrum cable users, however, do not have access to the Spectrum app on Fire TV. No, though you will need a free Amazon account in order toset upthe device. While you don't need to pay for a Prime membership to use Amazon Fire TV, it is useful and recommended. Membership comes with a selection of Prime Video content, including access to shows such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Expanse and Wheel of Time. These shows and other Amazon-branded content are heavily advertised in the Fire TV system and a Prime membership makes it easier to check out all that Amazon has to offer. Of the Fire Stick models, we prefer theFire TV Stick 4K Max. It launches apps quickly, and navigating around feels fast and smooth, thanks to its robust processor. It also comes with Dolby Vision support and Wi-Fi 6 for faster streaming. But when looking at all the great options on the market, we've given our top spot to the Roku Express 4K Plus. With the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search, the Express 4K plus is an excellent substitute to many Fire Stick devices. Unlike the Amazon-owned Fire Stick, the Roku also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another.  No, there is no monthly fee to use an Amazon Fire TV Stick. While you do need an Amazon account to set up the device, an Amazon Prime subscription is not required. Remember that many streaming services and channels do require a subscription to access them, like Netflix, Hulu or Disney Plus. Don't worry, though -- there are some great free options out there (Tubi, Pluto and Freevee areour top picks for the best free TV streaming services). With a Fire TV Stick in hand, you're sure to find great content with or without a subscription. Amazon announced the new Fire TV Stick HD in October of 2024 to replace both the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite. The newest model, available for $35, delivers much of the same experience you'd expect from our current roundup of Fire TV Stick devices like 1080p resolution and Alexa integration.","Not all Fire TV Sticks are created equal.

376,Best Password Manager in 2024,"What to consider  Security Look for a password manager that operates on a zero-knowledge basis and secures user vaults with industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption. Independent security audits can also help bolster trust in a password manager. Price Most password managers have pricing plans for individuals, families and businesses. Pricing for family and business plans is more expensive than individual plans, but family and business plans cover multiple users, while individual plans are limited to a single user. Cross-platform compatibility Before you purchase a subscription to a password manager, make sure it's compatible with all of the devices, operating systems and browsers you regularly use. The password manager should also automatically sync your passwords and other vault items across all of your devices. Features Make sure your password manager has standard features like multifactor authentication, a password generator, secure sharing and automatic sync. Other useful features to look out for include secure file storage, login autofill, vault health reporting and data breach and dark web monitoring. Secure sharing capabilities Most password managers include secure sharing features that allow you to safely share vault items with others. Some password managers allow secure sharing only with other users of the same service, while others allow secure sharing with anyone, regardless of whether they use a password manager. Secure file storage Some password managers offer secure file storage options that allow you to safely store documents like health records, bank statements, insurance paperwork and title documents. Some allow for 1GB of secure storage space, while others may offer up to 10GB. Family plan allowance If you want to share a password manager subscription with family or friends, it's a good move to opt for a password manager family plan. With a family plan, one subscription fee covers anywhere from five to 10 individual accounts, depending on the provider. Your passwords protect a lot of personal information, but creating and remembering a strong new password for everything can feel impossible. Secure passwords are ideally a complicated and unique combination of letters, numbers and characters. The more secure your password, the tougher it will be to remember. A password manager can generate these for you -- and make them as randomized as you'd like -- while also eliminating the fear of losing them. You'll still use a master password to log in to your password manager, but it's the only one you'll need to remember.

Family plan allowance If you want to share a password manager subscription with family or friends, it's a good move to opt for a password manager family plan. With a family plan, one subscription fee covers anywhere from five to 10 individual accounts, depending on the provider. There are a lot of password managers out there, so CNET tested a dozen of the most popular services on the market. Whether you're looking for a free password manager or you're open to spending a little money, we've evaluated everything from encryption to pricing, features, platform compatibility, privacy policies and company history to make picking the best secure password manager easier for you. Based on our rigorous testing,Bitwardenis currently CNET's top pick for the best password manager, thanks in large part to its commitment to transparency, ease of use and its unbeatable free tier. Bitwarden is a solid choice if you want well-rounded premium password management that's secure, transparent, budget-friendly and easy to use -- or if you want a legitimately unlimited password management solution for free. There is also a desktop app and a mobile app you can use for easy access across all of your devices. Bitwarden scores points for being fully open-source, secure andaudited annuallyby third-party cybersecurity firms, giving it a level of transparency that sets it apart from its peers. Meanwhile, its free plan lets you store an unlimited number of passwords and access them across an unlimited number of devices -- something most free password managers don’t offer. That’s in addition to many top-tier features like secure password sharing, encrypted vault export and a username and password generator. If you’d rather opt for a premium plan, Bitwarden offers full vault health reports, 1GB file storage, emergency access (where you can designate a trusted contact to access your vault in case of an emergency), Bitwarden authenticator and advanced multifactor authentication with YubiKey, FIDO2 and Duo. Premium plans are budget-friendly at $10 per year for individuals and $40 per year for families, which allows for up to six users. NordPass, a password manager for both businesses and individuals, is well-designed, easy to navigate and works seamlessly across all platforms. Enhanced by XChaCha20 encryption, it secures passwords, credit card details and notes. Currently, NordPass offers one of the most attractive Black Friday deals: only $1.29 per month, up to 56% off for premium plans. Additionally, users get 3 months extra with every purchase. NordPass premium plans include password health reports, a data breach scanner and monitoring, a password generator, secure sharing, emergency access and the ability to attach files to vault items totaling up to 3GB. Additionally, the email masking feature allows users to create a disposable email address that can be used to sign up for online services without revealing their identity. 1Password is a breeze to use on all your devices and includes some handy extras. The user interface is slick and intuitive, and its autofill functionality works seamlessly. Sharing passwords and other vault items with others is also simple, even if the people you’re sharing them with aren’t 1Password users. One stand-out feature is Travel Mode. When activated, vault items that you haven't marked as ""Safe for Travel"" will be temporarily erased from the app on all of your devices. This helps keep particularly sensitive login information or financial information inaccessible to any authorities who may ask you to unlock your device for inspection. 1Password is slightly on the more expensive side at $36 per year for individual users or $60 per year for families. You won’t find a free plan, but 1Password includes a 14-day free trial. Like other top password managers, Keeper lets you store and sync an unlimited number of vault items across an unlimited number of devices. Keeper offers apps for MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, along with an extension for popular internet browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Brave. I like Keeper’s “offline mode,” which allows you to access your vault items even if you're somewhere with zero or limited internet access. Standard pricing is $35 per year for individuals and $75 per year for a family of five, which is on the expensive side. A free plan is available if you don’t want to pay for a subscription, but it’s basically useless because it limits access to a single mobile device and 10 passwords. You’re better off going with Bitwarden if you want a legitimate free password manager. Alternatively, you can try Keeper’s premium tier before fully committing thanks to its generous 30-day free trial. Dashlane's password generator isn't quite as robust as what others offer, but it works well and offers sufficient options for customization. Premium plans also include access to a virtual private network fromHotspot Shield, a middling VPN that falls short of cracking our list oftop VPNs. Dashlane’s free plan used to allow for unlimited passwords on one device but nowlimits you to 25 passwordson a single device -- which is slightly more generous than Kepper’s 10-password limit but just as useless. Premium plans allow for an unlimited number of passwords on an unlimited number of devices but are decisively pricier than the competition (while delivering a lesser product). Individual plans cost $60 per year, which is more expensive than some of its rivals’ family plans. Dashlane's family plan covers up to 10 users, but for most people, 10 users is probably overkill and not worth the steep $90-per-year cost. Perhaps Dashlane’s high cost can be attributed to the fact that a VPN is included in the price, but you’re better off getting a quality VPN and a cheaper password manager separately than getting HotspotShield bundled with your Dashlane subscription. NordPass is well-designed, easy to navigate and works seamlessly across all platforms. The free version lets you store an unlimited number of vault items across all of your devices, and you get access to additional basic features like a password generator, advanced multi-factor authentication,passkey integrationand automatic sync. If you’re on the free plan, you can use it on as many devices as you like, but you can only be logged into a single device at a time -- which is a moderate inconvenience, but I appreciate that NordPass lets you access your passwords on an unlimited number of devices nonetheless. With a premium plan, you can be logged into as many devices as you’d like. Paid users also have access to password health reports, data breach scanner and monitoring, secure sharing, emergency access and the ability to attach files to vault items totaling up to 3GB. Individual premium plans cost $28 for the first year (renews at $35 annually thereafter) or $43 for the first two years combined (then $35 annually). If you opt for the family plan, you’ll get six premium user accounts for $44 for the first year (then $72 annually) or $67 for the first two years combined (then $72 annually). With the numerous password manager options available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. CNET has thoroughly tested dozens of password managers over the years, and we've developed a pretty good idea of the types of things to look for in a quality service. Here are the most important things to consider when choosing a password manager: You're putting a ton of trust in your password manager to keep your logins safe, so the security of the service should be your top concern. Look for a password manager that operates on a zero-knowledge basis and secures user vaults with industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption. Independent security audits can also help bolster trust in a password manager. If you're researching password managers, it's important to consider the company behind the service. Has the company been involved in any security incidents that have potentially compromised user data? If so, it's best to look elsewhere. Pricing for password managers can vary from provider to provider, so you'll want to pick a service that will fit your needs and budget. Most password managers have pricing plans for individuals, families and businesses. Pricing for family and business plans is more expensive than individual plans, but family and business plans cover multiple users, while individual plans are limited to a single user. Many password managers also offer free tiers, but they almost always come with limitations on features or device allowance. Some services, like Bitwarden, allow for unlimited vault entries on unlimited devices on their free plan. Most password managers also offer either a free trial or a money-back guarantee, so you can try them risk-free. One of the most important aspects of using a password manager is having it available on all of the devices you use. Before you purchase a subscription to a password manager, make sure it's compatible with all of the devices, operating systems and browsers you regularly use. The password manager should also automatically sync your passwords and other vault items across all of your devices. This helps ensure that you can access your passwords at any time from any of your devices. Make sure your password manager has standard features like multifactor authentication, a password generator, secure sharing and automatic sync. Other useful features to look out for include secure file storage, login autofill, vault health reporting and data breach and dark web monitoring. Many password managers also allow you to store things like credit card numbers, bank account numbers, health data, PIN codes and secure notes in addition to storing your online login credentials. It's never a good idea to share passwords or other highly sensitive information via email or SMS, but most password managers include secure sharing features that allow you to safely share vault items with others. Some password managers allow secure sharing only with other users of the same service, while others allow secure sharing with anyone, regardless of whether they use a password manager. Secure sharing features are also typically customizable and allow you to set restrictions on how many times a shared vault item can be accessed or for how long. If you're planning on sharing certain passwords with family members, friends or colleagues, it's a good idea to check on the password manager's secure sharing capabilities to ensure they suit your security needs. Some password managers offer secure file storage options that allow you to safely store documents like health records, bank statements, insurance paperwork and title documents. Some allow for 1GB of secure storage space, while others may offer up to 10GB. Depending on whether you need to store files and how much space you would need, it's a good idea to look into the secure file storage capabilities and allowances of the password manager you're considering. If you want to share a password manager subscription with family or friends, it's a good move to opt for a password manager family plan. With a family plan, one subscription fee covers anywhere from five to 10 individual accounts, depending on the provider. A family plan is a convenient and cost-effective option for anyone who wants to easily and securely share vault items with trusted contacts. The most important consideration for any password manager is the security of the product, so we look at what encryption standards it uses, whether it's a zero-knowledge service and whether it has been independently audited. We carefully examine each provider's privacy policy to get a sense of what personal data is collected from users and how that data is secured. We examine the provider's pricing and check whether a free version is available. We also test how the password manager performed across platforms, devices and operating systems. We test the services' multi-factor authentication, password generator and secure sharing features and evaluate the overall look and feel of the UI, including monitoring and password health reporting, if applicable. Enpass is unique in that it doesn't have centralized servers that store your data. You can either store your vault on your devices themselves or in your personal cloud storage like Dropbox or iCloud. That makes it a great option for anyone who wants complete control over the storage of their password manager vaults. On the downside, the app is a bit outdated and clunky but still fully functional. KeePass is completely open source and completely free. It's a powerful password manager but geared primarily toward the techie crowd. Regular people may find the interface outdated and cumbersome to navigate compared with those of other password managers. Apple launched a new Passwords app with the release of iOS 18 in September. It’s a step up from the basic functionality offered by iCloud Keychain, but Passwords is still rather barebones and mostly only useful for Apple users. Apple’s Passwords app is a secure and convenient place to store your passwords, passkeys, authentication codes and Wi-Fi network passwords across your Apple devices. I like the app’s Security section that alerts you if it detects any compromised or reused passwords. You can also securely share passwords and passkeys with trusted contacts. The Passwords app is only available for iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro, but you can leverage iCloud Keychain to access your passwords on a Mac or PC. If you’re looking for a password manager that you can use for the long term for free, then it needs to offer two things for it to be worth it: strong zero-knowledge encryption and auto-syncing of unlimited passwords across unlimited devices. Having access to all of your passwords across all of your devices is the foundation of your password manager’s effectiveness. You’ll be able to easily get to all of your (strong and unique) account passwords wherever you are and on any device you have on hand, which can reduce the temptation to take the unsafe route of using the same easy-to-remember password across all of your online logins. If the free password manager you’re using can only be used on one device and for only a handful of passwords, then it’s practically useless beyond just giving you a preview of what you can expect the software’s paid tier look and feel to be like. A free password manager typically won’t include advanced features like detailed vault health reports, data breach scanning and encrypted file attachments, but if all you need is a safe place to store all of your passwords that you can access from all of your devices, then there are a few options. I recommend using Bitwarden if you want a legitimate unlimited free password manager that you can use for the long term. It’s one of the few password managers that offers a free tier that delivers core password manager features -- plus a few extras -- at no cost. Bitwarden is the most secure password manager right now thanks to its zero-knowledge end-to-end AES-CBC 256-bit encryption, excellent security features and annual independent security audits. Many other password manager apps are closed-source, but Bitwarden is fully open-source, meaning that its entire source code is publicly available for anyone to scrutinize. Bitwarden also operates a Security and Compliance Program that defines policies “that govern security practices and processes and are continually updated to be consistent with applicable legal, industry, and regulatory requirements,” according to itsSecurity Whitepaper. Yes, security experts recommend using a password manager as an effective way to maintain the security of your online accounts. Weak and reused passwords can make it easy for bad actors to gain access to your accounts, potentially leading to consequences like identity theft or financial loss. Security experts recommend password managers because they can create and store unique, complex passwords that make it exponentially more difficult for anyone to crack your account logins. Security experts also like password managers because they can monitor the dark web for potentially compromised credentials, notify users of data breaches and even help guard against phishing attacks by not autofilling passwords into suspected phishing sites. After signing up for a password manager, you'll be prompted to create a master password. Your master password should be a strong password or passphrase that you can remember but haven't used for any other logins. The master password is the one password you need to access your password manager vault. The next step is to download the app or browser extension to the devices you plan to use the service on. You can also opt to use the web-based user interface if you prefer (if offered by the service you choose). Once you've signed up and gotten acquainted with the app, start adding passwords and other vault items you want to keep secure. If you have passwords stored in a web browser or other password manager, you can easily import them to the new password manager. You also can manually enter the login credentials, or you can have your password manager automatically save your credentials when you log into one of your online accounts. Once you've got your passwords saved, you can use your password manager to autofill the login credentials for the accounts you have stored in your vault. Password managers are extremely attractive targets for cybercriminals -- and yes, they can be hacked. All of the password managers listed above operate on a zero-knowledge approach to password management, meaning that not even the company storing your vault data can decrypt the information contained within. Only the user can decrypt and access their vault. Similarly, the password managers featured above don't have access to your master password. All of this makes it difficult for an attacker to gain access to the passwords and other items in your vault. In the case of the 2022 LastPass breach, attackers were able to steal encrypted user vaults. So all the attacker would need to do is crack the master password for a stolen vault to access everything inside, which would be an easy task if the master password is weak. The best way to protect your data in case of a similar breach is to create a strong master password. A strong password should ideally be a minimum of 12 characters. You can also create passphrases that consist of randomly strung-together words. The best password managers offer customizable password generators that you can use to create truly random passwords and passphrases based on the criteria you select. The longer and more complex the password or passphrase, the better. There are a few legitimate free password manager options for anyone who wants to securely store their passwords without paying a dime. Bitwarden is CNET's recommendation for the best free password manager. NordPass is another solid option. If you're more technically inclined, you can go with KeePass, which is completely free and unlimited but not as easy to use as many others.  If you want all the bells and whistles included in a premium, paid password manager, there are some budget-friendly options priced between $10 and $30 per year. LastPass is one of the most well-known and popular password managers on the market. In light of its lengthy history of security incidents -- including thedata breach at the end of 2022in which an ""unauthorized party"" stole customer account information and sensitive vault data -- CNET can't in good conscience recommend LastPass to our readers. The company says it’s since boosted security, but the alarming nature of that latest data breach has severely undermined trust in LastPass products. CNET will conduct a thorough re-review of the service in the future, after which we will reevaluate whether LastPass should return to our list of best password managers. In the meantime, you can turn to any of the password managers featured above.",Keep all your passwords in a secure place you can easily access with the best password managers.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/,
377,Best Universal Remote for 2024,"If you have a home theater system, you know how awkward it can be juggling multiple remotes. Yet, buying a universal remote can change that. The best universal remotes are easy to program without the need for codes, offering an easy-to use app which connects via wi-fi or Bluetooth. Some TVs offer the ability to program your set-top box into the remote, while Roku and Amazon Fire TV clickers offer the ability to control the TV as well as your streaming box. While brands like Logitech and Caavo bowed out, Sofabaton breathed new life into universal remotes and the company’s U2 controls not only your TV but gaming consoles, media players and more. Read more:Best Nest and Google Assistant Devices for 2024 If you have a handful of remotes you regularly juggle, and you have a smartphone, then the SofaBaton U2 is the best way to tame them.The SofaBaton U2picks up the mantle left by the Logitech Harmony remotes, pairing simple programming with excellent ease of use. While the more-expensive Logitech 665 offers more power -- including the ability to program more sophisticated macros or ""activities"" -- the SofaBaton is the best universal remote for most people. Also note that you can save a few bucks by activating theinstant couponon the product page. Logitech Harmony wrote the book on the universal remote control devices, and this remote is still very good despite being discontinued. The main appeal over cheaper universal remotes, including the Sofbaton U2, is the activity-based control. Press the ""Watch TV,"" ""Play Game"" or ""Listen to Music"" and the Logitech Harmony remote turns on all the relevant devices (such as yoursmart TV, cable box game console and AV receiver), switches to the right inputs and maps the keys to that activity: Volume to the receiver and Channel up-down to the cable box, for example. As this is an end-of-life product, it's only available in renewed or refurbished condition, and can sell for some pretty crazy prices, but you shouldn't be spending any more than $100 or so for it. If you have a Roku streaming device and it lacks the ability to control your TV, the Voice Remote Pro may be worth the investment. This clicker isn't universal -- it only works with Roku streamers (and TVs) -- but it will control volume, power and mute on pretty much any brand of TV, so you might not need the TV's original clicker at all. The coolest feature of the Voice Remote Pro is the voice-activated remote finder. Just say ""Hey Roku, find my remote"" and it will beep from among the couch cushions (or wherever you left it). If you have a Roku TV, Roku's voice system also enables commands like ""What's the time?"" or ""Switch to HDMI 2."" Lastly, the Pro also has a headphone jack for private listening. Much like the Roku Voice Remote Pro, the Fire TV version is designed to work with Fire TV streaming devices, allowing control of connected TVs' volume, power and mute. It's not actually universal, aside from the fact that it controls most brands of TV. We didn't like the Fire TV's remote finder function as much -- it requires a separate Alexa device to work -- but otherwise the two are very similar. The wacky Cube is a mashup of universal remote controls, theFire TV 4K streamerandAmazon Echo speaker, making it the king of your smart home devices. It comes with a device but its buttons are sparse and rudimentary; real device control happens via your voice. The Cube has an IR emitter to control your gear and a mic sensitive enough to hear your commands over the blare of music. On the downside, you'll need to keep your old remotes (even ones that aren't smart) around for many functions. This controlling universal remote is often sold for as little as $50 or less, so definitely wait for a sale on this device -- orPrime Day-- before buying it. It's worth noting that the 2019 Fire TV Cube has been replaced by anew Fire TV Cube. Look out for CNET's full review shortly.","If you've been looking for a universal remote to control your TV, these are the best options out there.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-universal-remote/,

Bose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. All that adds up to a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max. SCORE When you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $330 price tag ($80 more than the WH-1000XM4), most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance, as well as even better noise canceling and more refined sound. SCORE When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise-canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. For $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly, too. Overall, they're really impressive; they are easily among the very top earbuds on the market. SCORE Earfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but they're often on sale. Use codeEWPROCNETat checkout for an additional discount.While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less. They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphones and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer). While the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. A natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit. SCORE Several years in development, Sonos' new Ace headphones are finally available. They're mostly very impressive, though they aren't without a few downsides, including a rather high price tag and some potential glitches with a key feature. Overall they're very well designed and also deliver top-notch sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. SCORE Sony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. They sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Perhaps for some people, yes. The good news is that like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these are often on sale so keep an eye out. SCORE Love 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them -- they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. That's not quite accurate, due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. Read ourfull reviewto find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats. SCORE The W830NB is the successor to Edifier's popular W820NB Plus, one of the better value noise-canceling headphones of the last few years. The W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, and the like that earlier model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory-foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android. The W830NB do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB support the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing, however. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included but most computers and smartphones have USB-C now). Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. They offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Pro-- Apple's $3,499 wearable headset. Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different from current devices like the iPhone?Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE QCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads. The sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones. You do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. That said, the H3 Pro are all in all a very good value, particularly when their price dips closer to $50. Sennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors. The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that ""assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste."" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers ""best-in-class"" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to. SCORE If you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro (read our full review). Yes, the noise-canceling might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. SCORE Google's redesigned itsPixel Buds Pro 2to fit more ears better. Not only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new ""hands-free, eyes-free"" Gemini virtual AI assistant. So long as you get a snug fit and tight seal (yes, that's critical for sound quality and noise-canceling performance), these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. SCORE When Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations and that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance. As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products ""visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language."" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to ""help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing."" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can readour review of the QuietComfort 45to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones. SCORE Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. They're heavy, but they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. SCORE In 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, new for 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Although it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras. When I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're very solid midrange headphones that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200. We've always been fans of Sony's MDR-7506 wired studio monitor headphones, which have long been favorite headphones of recording engineers and other sound professionals. The new-for-2024 MDR-M1 are essentially a premium version of the 7506, delivering sound that's hard to match for the price. These are the wired headphones that will make you realize what you're missing after listening to wireless headphones for so long. They feature big, open sound with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass. Not only is their sound a noticeable step up from the 7506's, but these get high marks for their comfort level (they weigh a svelte 216 grams). No, there isn't any noise canceling, but the soft, cushy ear pads offer good passive noise isolation. Though they play louder with a headphone amp, they're easy to drive (50 ohms), so you can plug them directly into a computer's headphone port or a smartphone (likely with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter). They come with 1.2m and 2.5m straight detachable cables and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm screw-in plug adapter, but no carrying pouch or case is included. The only downside I see is that the ear pads aren't all that deep, so it's possible those with large ears that stick out a bit might have some issue with the M1's fit -- your ears might press up against the drivers, which are notable for serving up distortion-free audio, even at higher volume levels. That said, they look and feel like an upgraded version of the 7506, so if those worked for you, these should too. Hot on the heels of thethird-generation AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the 2021 Beats Fit Pro ($200) aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensiveStudio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of theAirPods Pro'sfeatures, including active noise canceling, spatial audio, Adaptive EQ and IPX4 water-resistance (splash-proof). I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. For some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro.Read our Beats Fit Pro review. SCORE Noble is an audiophile brand known more for its in-ear monitor headphones, but it's got a new-for-2024 wireless noise-canceling headphone called the Fokus Apollo that sounds terrific and features a special dual-driver design that combines a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar-magnetic driver. The result is rich, open sound, with tight bass and excellent treble detail and clarity, especially for a wireless headphone (it sounds a tad better in wired mode but it's not a huge difference). It's more dynamic than many monitor headphones that have a flatter, more neutral sound profile, but it still leans toward being an accurate, well-balanced headphone. The design of the headphones is slightly generic looking, but they have some premium accents (Alcantara material on the headband and protein leather ear pads that are replaceable), and they fit my head comfortably. A decent, albeit somewhat large carrying case is included along with a cable for wired listening (USB-C audio is supported). And in case you want to use the headphones for videoconference calls at home or do a little multiplayer gaming, a detachable boom microphone ships with the headphones. Equipped with a Qualcomm QC3084 chip (Bluetooth 5.3) and anADIchip, the Fokus Apollo 'phones support a wide variety of audio codecs, including LDAC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC. Interestingly, that's not Qualcomm's higher-end 5-series chip, but I had no issues with wireless performance, and voice-calling performance was good with decent noise reduction. As with a lot of audiophile active noise-canceling (ANC) headphones, the noise canceling is decent but not up to the level of what Bose, Sony and Apple ANC headphones offer. ANC impacts sound quality, so it's not surprising it's a little lighter with this headphone (there's also a transparency mode and a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak settings). It's also worth noting that you don't get extra bells and whistles like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off -- you're really buying this headphone for its sound quality and those dual drivers. That said, battery life is another plus. It's rated for up 60 hours with ANC on at moderate volume levels. Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. Now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the ""e"" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been returned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip. These headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more. When they were originally announced, Bowers & Wilkins swanky PX8 noise-canceling headphones were supposed to cost $549 or essentially the same price as Apple's AirPod Max headphones. When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below). The biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are ""inspired"" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2. Based on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound quality in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. As for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). While I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, although the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second. French audio companyFocalis known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. Over three years in development, the Bathys cost $799 and feature not only wireless connectivity but a built-in digital-to-analog converter for USB wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C. They are easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones.  If you're willing to spend a lot of money, Beyerdynamic's 2nd-generation Xelento Wireless earbuds deliver fantastic sound quality. Note that these can be used wired or wireless, with the buds detaching from the Bluetooth 5.2 neckband so you can use them with the included traditional 3.5mm jack cable (included). Equipped with Berydynamic's 11mm Tesla.11 drivers, the Xelento Wireless earbuds are special because of how clean and clear they sound, with no distortion and tight, well-defined bass that has excellent extension. They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). The neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy ofAKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported). Like some other high-end earbuds, these feature an ear-monitor design similar to what musicians use, with the cable wrapping around the top of your ear. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new headphones. The quality of value-priced headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more. It's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. You want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise-canceling, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. It's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. We test headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria. These criteria includedesign,sound quality,noise-canceling performance,voice-calling performance, featuresandvalue. Mark Levinson No. 5909: The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. They're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy), and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headbands. Read ourMark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on. Technics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback but the headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail (they take a day or two to break in). Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: Featuring excellent sound, improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well a smaller, more refined design that includes stabilizing fins (so the earbuds stay in your ears more securely), the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are among the best true-wireless earbuds, giving the Sony WF-1000XM4 a run for the money. Read ourSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review. Sennheiser 450BT: Sennheiser updated its well-regarded 4.50BTNC noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The new headphone model is called the 450BT, and it has some notable upgrades, including better battery life (up to 30 hours with noise canceling on), USB-C charging, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX support for devices like the Samsung Galaxy smartphones that support it and more comfortable earpads. The 450BT noise-canceling headphones list for $200, but usually cost around $125 although they have dipped to as low as $100 in flash sales (they're a good value at that price). Both companies make very good headphones, which offer excellent active noise canceling. Some people may argue that Sony has a very slight lead right now, but others may slightly prefer Bose. The Sony WH-1000XM5 is one of our top-rated headphones, but Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds 2 arguably have the best noise canceling at the moment. Both brands are staples in the audio world, makingexcellent soundbars,speakers, and otherhome theater essentials. Neither is better or worse, they're just different styles of headphones. If you're looking for more discreet headphones, with a charging case that can easily fit in a pocket, true-wireless earbuds (in-ear headphones) are the way to go. Many people don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears, so they prefer full-size headphones. They're getting close. Premium wireless headphones can easily sound better than middle-of-the-road wired headphones that cost less than $100. Going wired still is the best option for optimal sound quality, but wireless headphones often come with a cord that allows you to plug in. If you're looking to muffle ambient sound from the outside world, active noise canceling is a feature you'll want in your headphones. Note that noise-canceling performance varies from headphone to headphone, with Bose, Sony and Apple arguably offering the best.",Looking for a new pair of headphones?

380,Best Streaming Services of 2024,"What to consider Content Originals, kids' titles and back catalogs all make a difference when deciding which streaming service is worth your money, along with the availability of new releases and blockbuster movies. Examine the library offerings of each streamer to determine whether they carry all episodes of shows you enjoy, movies, older titles or a selection of foreign content. Price Now that most streaming platforms offer ad-based options, you can choose whether you want to pay to watch without commercials, or if tolerating ads is better for your budget. Monthly prices start around $6-$7 and go up to $23, but you can also consider rotating your services to pay less overall for streaming TV in a year. Simultaneous streams With any streaming service, you'll want to know how many screens you can watch at a time. For example, Netflix's ad-based plan allows two simultaneous streams, but you have to upgrade to the premium version if your family needs four screens. Look for platform offerings that let your household stream on multiple devices at once if that's what you need. Streaming services have undergone major changes in the past three years alone in terms of price, content and features. With our extensive best list, which includesNetflix, Hulu, Disney Plus andMax, we can help you select which platforms are right for you. We've reviewed each of these streaming services individually and assigned numeric ratings based on catalogs, app design and features and overall value. Some judgments are based on our tastes for content, so note that if you love a specific show or style of the show, you may have a different favorite.

For example, Netflix's ad-based plan allows two simultaneous streams, but you have to upgrade to the premium version if your family needs four screens. Look for platform offerings that let your household stream on multiple devices at once if that's what you need. Netflix stands out as a leading contender among the streaming services we reviewed. It boasts a dependable and user-friendly interface while offering a vast range of features and a constantly evolving catalog with diverse content. The streamer consistently adds new originals from around the world, and you can evendiscover titles by using secret codes. The addition of an ad-based tier makes it even more affordable compared with rivals such as Disney Plus and Max. There are other quality streaming services, but Netflix is currently our top recommendation, although it's essential to consider your budget and personal preferences. Read more: There's a reason why Netflix has become shorthand for streaming in general. The former movie rental service evolved into the top-tier streaming app that's a must-have in 2024, even if you'repaying extra to share your password. When big originals like The Witcher or Stranger Things drop, they grab the attention of millions of viewers, along with critical praise and awards, giving us the closest thing we have to watercooler conversations these days. The streamer offers a wide variety of familiar network shows and more original series, films, documentaries and specials than any of its competitors. New shows and movies arrive each week. The company doesn't mind catering to different tastes with gaming options and categories for kids, and anime and foreign-language titles from all over the globe. Starting at $7 a month for an ad-supported account and $15.50 monthly for the standard ad-free plan, its price is in the middle of the TV service pack. The $23 premium option gives you 4K content and four screens, both standard plans -- with or without ads -- include HD and two simultaneous streams. For the variety you get, it's still a top pick. Disney Plus is one of Netflix's closest competitors for good reason. It's the only place where you can stream the vast majority of the Disney and Pixar libraries, along with every Star Wars movie, Marvel films, new original TV shows, National Geographic content and 30-plus seasons of The Simpsons. Shows like The Mandalorian,Loki, Andor andShe-Hulk, have drawn millions of viewers, while features such as Avatar 2 and Encanto won rave reviews. Plus, there's lots more Star Wars and Marvel original programming coming in the next few years. At the current price of $10 per month for the ad-based plan, Disney Plus is a family-friendly streaming TV choice that offers value. We consider it a must-have if you have kids or are a fan of any of its other titles (and who isn't a fan of Baby Yoda?). The premium ad-free version now costs $16 monthly, but Disney has four bundles that range from $11 to $27 per month. Duo Basic is a $11-per-month plan that combines Disney Plus and Hulu with ads, ad-free Duo Premium costs $20 per month. For $17 monthly, the Disney Bundle Trio Basic comes with Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus, all with ads. A $27-per-month Trio Premium bundle nets you all three streaming platforms, and only ESPN Plus has ads. If you have a Disney bundle or subscriptions for both Disney Plus and Hulu, you can now watch Hulu content on the Disney Plus app. Though it's not an official ""Disney Bundle,"" there's an alternate bundle thatcombines Max, Hulu and Disney Plusfor either $17 or $30 a month, depending on whether you want to go with ads or ad-free. Max is an updated app full of popular TV shows and movies. It has HBO's entire library and DC Universe titles, along with favorites such as Friends, the Lord of the Rings movies and almost everyStudio Ghiblifilm. It's the primary destination for new Warner Bros.-owned feature films. It's not Disney Plus, but Max has a solid streaming collection for kids too, with the ability to control ratings on kids' profiles better than most other services. At $10 per month, it sits next to Netflix at the higher end of the streaming spectrum, and if you prefer the ad-free experience, the cost jumps up to $17 or $21 per month. Max is ramping up its new originals, and we expect that to increase over time. With the addition of Discovery Plus unscripted content, there's more to stream. Although its 8.0 rating is neck-and-neck with Prime Video, Max consistently drops new releases, possesses a large back catalog and offers smooth, user-friendly features. The platform also offers a live sports tier, B/R sports, as part of its current package, but the optional add-on is due to cost an additional $10 per month later this year. For $10 per month (with ads), Hulu offers a counterpoint to Netflix. Its channel lineup has a huge variety of familiar shows from networks like ABC, Fox and FX that you can watch soon after they air (unlike on Netflix), as well as a growing catalog of its own critically acclaimed original series like How to Die Alone and Only Murders in the Building. If you have $10 a month to spare and don't mind trading a few ads for a wealth of TV options, Hulu is a no-brainer. You also have the option to upgrade to a no-ads plan for $19 a month oradd on live TV streaming for $83 a month for a full cable replacement. Prime Videonow has adsin its default version of the streaming app, but you can pay a $3 fee to stream without them. The commercial breaks are relatively short compared with other streamers. The platform offers quality original shows and movies, an impressive back catalog of older favorites (andB-moviesyou haven't heard of) and NFL on Thursday nights. It lacks the catalogs of Netflix and Hulu and the star power of Disney's streaming platform, and I found its menus more confusing since there's some paid content mixed in with free content. Prime Video's redesign aims to cut down on that confusion with clearer labeling and menu updates for its global customer base. For millions of Prime subscribers, the Prime Video channel is already included at no extra cost. If you're interested in checking out any of its originals likeFalloutor its large movie selection, it may even be worth paying the standalone $9-per-month TV fee (if you don't have Amazon Prime). Priced at $11 a month without ads, Starz provides a unique but expanding library of films and original shows. With more than 800 movies in its bank that range from '80s classics to Westerns to the hottest new Sony releases, the streamer houses every genre in its catalog. Starz has been inching its way into the prestige TV market with a quality lineup of original programming. It's best known for the Power Universe, Outlander and The White Queen. Starz also airs Lionsgate movies and shows -- like John Wick and Saw. While you can't stream feature films as day-and-date releases, Starz has a deal with Universal to broadcast its lineup. That includes flicks such as Megan, Minions: The Rise of Gru and Oppenheimer. For $11 a month, the Starz app gives you unlimited downloads, early access to new TV show episodes, and four simultaneous streams, all with no ads. Whether you want to stream blockbuster movies, documentaries, original series or something for kids, Starz is worth the cost. ESPN Plus is a great streaming service for tried-and-true sports fans, especially those who follow the NHL, MLS and UFC. This is because ESPN Plus is the new home of all out-of-market National Hockey League games, while also offering out-of-market MLS soccer matches, along with those from other soccer leagues around the world. It hosts exclusive UFC matches and pay-per-view events, such as UFC Fight Night and championship bouts (for additional fees). Hockey and MLS fans who root for teams that aren't based where they currently live need ESPN's streaming service to watch their team's action. The service won't be of much use to fans of the home teams. Local games are blacked out on ESPN Plus so you'll need access to your regional sports network through cable or a live TV streaming service to watch them. Golf fans can stream the PGA Tour live on the platform. ESPN Plus doesn't show live NFL or NBA games, and while its vast library of original programming is impressive, it's difficult to navigate. The year service is best suited for die-hard fans of the sports it covers well, but more casual fans might find themselves with an ESPN Plus subscription anyway through theDisney Bundle, which also includes Hulu and Disney Plus starting at $15 a month. A standalone subscription for ESPN Plus costs $12, but some viewers may find it more cost-effective to pay for one of the Disney Bundles, which range from $17 to $27 monthly with ESPN Plus included. If you're looking to watch an abundance of sports content, check out our picks for thebest sports streaming services. NBCUniversal's streaming servicePeacockoffers a premium ad-supported option for $8 a month, granting you access to more than 80,000 hours worth of content. Upgrade to Premium Plus for $14 a month to watch without commercials. The service no longer offers its free, ad-supported tier to new subscribers, but existing Peacock customers can downgrade their accounts to watch about 10,000 hours of shows, movies, news and live sports. Fan favorites on the platform include the TV series The Office, and viewers can also watch Premier League soccer matches, WWE events and originals like Poker Face. Keep in mind you need a premium account to watch full seasons of most shows. New episodes of NBC shows stream exclusively on Peacock, and Premium Plus members can watch live local NBC channels in real time. Newer additions include a dedicated Hallmark channel that airs simulcasts and new movie premieres that typically arrive 45 days after their theatrical releases. Peacock drops in the rankings due to its lack of mobile downloads for its nonpremium plus tiers and limited 4K HDR streaming, which most of its competitors offer. Although you can get the service as part of anew bundle with Netflix and Apple TV Plus, look out for aprice hike in July. Paramount Plusbrings together live news and sports with on-demand shows and movies, including originals, leaning on parent company Paramount's brands like CBS, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and Paramount Network, plus its Paramount Pictures movie studio. Now that Showtime series and movies have merged into the Paramount Plus app, you can upgrade to a premium subscription to watch content from both services in one place. The service has a ton of content: 30,000 episodes of TV and 2,500 movies, plus dozens of original series, for either $8 a month (with ads) or $13 a month (ad-free with Showtime). Two of its biggest draws include the Star Trek catalog and newer originals like Star Trek: Discovery and Picard, and the series The Good Fight. Buzz-worthy originals include Yellowstone spinoffs (although Yellowstone itself is on rival Peacock), two Star Trek animated series,Rabbit Holewith Kiefer Sutherland, and feature films likeMission: Impossible 7. Much of its value lies in nostalgia: You can watch just about every old Nickelodeon show, Comedy Central stand-up specials and popular series ranging from Frasier and Cheers to SpongeBob SquarePants and Young Sheldon. Additionally, Paramount Plus has aLive Channelsfeature which enables subscribers to watch curated content in special categories. Check out channels for Star Trek, CBS Sports HQ, Paw Patrol and more with either subscription plan. With the price jump to $10 a month,Apple TV Plusis no longer the lowest-priced premium, ad-free streaming service available. It does come with high-end features like 4K resolution,HDRand mobile downloads. It's also the one service on this list that includes only original content, and no regular back catalog of shows or movies to explore. It now has more than 50 exclusive, big-budget original programming shows and movies, but only a few have captured widespread attention, such asTed Lasso,SeveranceandCODA, which won 2022's Oscar for best picture. Although the service is branching out with additions like live Major League Baseball games on Fridays, its library is far smaller than what you'll find with any of the other services on this list. The app is also confusing because it's housed in the larger Apple TV app with other content. Apple TV Plus has one big advantage: There are a lot of ways to get it for free, at least for a while. If you're a degree-seeking college student, a new purchaser of an Apple device, or someone who subscribes to theApple One bundle, you can snag a long-term free trial of Apple TV Plus. Chances are you're already pretty familiar with most of the names on this list, but it's by no means comprehensive. There are plenty of other ways to stream and hundreds of other choices available. As weevaluated these particular streaming options, we kept certain things in mind. This list is ordered based on the numerical value I assigned to each streaming service in their individual review, which I determined by design (i.e. ease of use across different TV and mobile platforms), features (like 4K HDR, mobile downloads, recommendations, watch lists and number of streams), content (number of shows and quality of originals and back catalogs) and value (price compared to these other factors). Click through to the full reviews for more details. Below is a summarized look at each service's price, simultaneous streams and availability of ad-based plans to help you decide which platforms are a good fit for you. Tubi: Known for its large library of free content, Tubi offers some live channels in addition to its on-demand content. You'll find popular TV series and reality shows along with mainstream movies such as Hobbs & Shaw, Sing and Us. Its catalog now includes titles from HBO, and iPhone users cantap its AI feature to searchfor content. We consider Tubi one of thebest free streaming services, but the service's selection of originals and obscure titles and its search interface are less appealing than the platforms on this list. Crunchyroll: The app has not snagged a spot on this best list yet, but we do consider it thebest anime streaming serviceout there. It's a niche platform with a huge selection of anime and new simulcasts, which fans can watch right after a show airs in Japan. The app boasts some cool features and multiple subscription plans that come with extra perks. What Crunchyroll lacks are parental controls and the ability to set up more than one profile for an account. To watch any of the services on this list you'll need a solid internet connection, a compatible device (like a Roku, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV, a smart TV, phone, tablet or computer) and a valid username and password. CNET offerstips on how to optimize your internet speedfor streaming Netflix and these other services. Ultimately, you can choose any streaming service you want based on price, content and who watches what in your household. If you're looking to pare down costs, opt for free platforms or ones that offer the most value for $10 or less. CNET offers tips on how totrim your streaming budget, and we keep up with the lateststreaming service dealsand discounts.

What to consider Trustworthiness Choose antivirus software from a trusted company to avoid accidentally installing malware. Features Look for real-time protection, manual scan performance and scan scheduling. Some antivirus tools may have additional layers of security like ransomware protection. Free vs. paid antivirus software Most free antivirus tools limit the number of devices you can use and/or the features you have access to. If you've got the budget, consider paid antivirus software for more robust protection. System resources A deep scan shouldn't use so many resources that it makes your computer unusable. CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. What to consider Trustworthiness Choose antivirus software from a trusted company to avoid accidentally installing malware. Features Look for real-time protection, manual scan performance and scan scheduling. Some antivirus tools may have additional layers of security like ransomware protection. Free vs. paid antivirus software Most free antivirus tools limit the number of devices you can use and/or the features you have access to. If you've got the budget, consider paid antivirus software for more robust protection. System resources A deep scan shouldn't use so many resources that it makes your computer unusable. The best free antivirus software isAvira Free Antivirus. This software offers real-time protection against malware like viruses, plus manual and automated scans. Avira Free Antivirus also provides protection from phishing -- a type of fraud involving sending emails or messages pretending to come from a reputable source to steal information -- and ransomware -- a type of malware that locks your computer and requires you to send a payment to unlock it. Avira Free Antivirus also includes a software updater to automatically keep your apps and drivers up to date. Avira Free Antivirus comes with apassword managerplus a browser extension that blocks malicious sites and ad trackers/third-party trackers. Best of all, you can use Avira Free Antivirus on most operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android. However, some features -- including the Software Updater program -- are only available for Windows PCs. Antivirus software scans your computer for viruses and other malware -- software built for a malicious purpose, often to harm your machine, steal key information or lock you out of your device -- and helps you remove it. Most antivirus software offers two types of protection: scheduled/manual scans, which actively search your device for malware, and real-time protection, which detects and blocks malware in attempted downloads. Avira Free Antivirus uses the same antivirus engine as the paid version of Avira, which consistently receiveshigh rankings in all AV-Test categories. You’ll get real-time protection as well as the option to run manual scans and schedule scans on a daily or weekly basis. This last feature is particularly notable, as both Microsoft Defender and XProtect (the MacOS equivalent to Microsoft Defender) lack the ability to schedule scans. Other layers of protection include phishing protection, ransomware protection and a Software Updater that automatically updates apps and drivers. You’ll also get a browser extension that blocks unsafe sites, ad tracking and other third-party trackers. A password manager is also included. None of these features are included with Microsoft Defender, XProtect or Bitdefender. AVG Free Antivirus includes some of these features, but lacks a password manager. Avira Free Antivirus is available for MacOS, iOS and Android, but certain features -- like the Software Updater -- only work with Windows. There are also many features listed in the dashboard that are only partially accessible without upgrading to a paid version. For example, if you run a System Speedup scan, Avira will find performance issues, but if you click on the option to fix them, you’ll be told to upgrade. Avira Free Antivirus is the best free antivirus if you want a full security suite without spending a dime. The Software Updater makes it a particularly great choice if you're using Windows. Microsoft Defender (formerly known as Windows Defender) is built into Windows 10 and 11 and enabled by default. Microsoft Defender consistently receives high marks fromAV-Test, and the program is updated regularly to ensure protection against new malware. Defender provides real-time protection and runs automated scans. You can run manual scans if you’re ever concerned about your computer’s performance or a specific file or program you’ve downloaded. You can also set up Controlled Folder Access, which automatically stops apps from making unauthorized changes to your folders (you can manually exclude apps you trust). The one big drawback of Defender is that you can’t schedule the scans yourself; you’ll have to rely on the program’s automatic scans or run an on-demand check. However, Defender can track when your system is idle and tends to run scans during this time. Windows 10 and 11 will automatically disable its own Windows Defender antiviruswhen you install third-party antivirus programs. If you uninstall the third-party protection, Windows will turn on its own antivirus again. Microsoft Defender is a good choice if you're looking for no-effort antivirus protection and you followinternet safety best practices. Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition offers real-time protection against malware like viruses and spyware alongside ransomware protection. Bitdefender antivirus regularly earns a6 out of 6 protection rankingfrom the AV-Test lab, plus high rankings for usability and performance. You can run manual scans and schedule daily, weekly or monthly scans to catch anything that makes it through Bitdefender’s real-time protection. The free antivirus version covers one Windows or MacOS computer. You can also download Bitdefender apps for iOS and Android. For broader protection including parental controls and a VPN, you can choose Bitdefender Total Security or Bitdefender Antivirus Plus. Bitdefender is a great choice if you're looking for robust antivirus protection and you don't need or want any other cybersecurity tools. AVG Antivirus Free and the paidAVG Internet Securityapp use the same antivirus cores -- the difference is that AVG Internet Security comes with a full suite of tools, like an enhanced firewall and webcam protection. Moreover, AVG consistently earns high scores in all threeAV-Testcategories, with the lowest recent ranking being a 5.5 out of 6 for performance. With AVG Antivirus Free, you’ll get both real-time protection and the ability to manually run Deep Scans to find and remove malware that gets through the initial layer of protection. You can also schedule scans to run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. AVG Antivirus Free guards against phishing and ransomware, plus provides a browser extension that blocks harmful sites and third-party tracking. You can get AVG Antivirus Free for Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android. The one drawback of the free version of AVG is the prominent upsells. You’ll be directed to get a paid subscription if you click on certain features. Some of these upsells are rather sneaky, such as the one associated with the Smart Scan. You can run the Smart Scan and see issues it points out -- like vulnerabilities and settings configurations that might be harming your computer’s performance -- but when you click “Resolve All”, you’ll be hit with an upsell. AVG Antivirus Free is a great choice if you're looking for robust protection but you don't need the full suite of tools provided by Avira Free Antivirus. Some particularly insidious malware is disguised as free antivirus software. You download something to protect your computer, and instead, you infect it, leading to stolen data or a locked device. You can avoid this malware by sticking with trusted antivirus companies. Choose a company from a vetted list like this one, read the third-party tests we link to and make sure the URL you’re downloading from is authentic. Antivirus software typically offers two layers of protection: Antivirus tools may also block malicious websites and protect you from threats like phishing, but these features are typically only included with premium programs. Similarly, antivirus tools may only provide limited scan scheduling. Most free antivirus software programs are created by companies that also produce paid antivirus tools. They typically use the same antivirus engines as the paid versions, so you’ll get the same level of scanning and malware protection you’d get if you bought premium antivirus from the company. However, this protection is often only available for one device per person, whereas paid antivirus tools offer packages for five, 10 or even unlimited devices. Moreover, paid antivirus software usually comes with additional benefits, such as advanced ransomware and phishing protection. Many companies also offer full security suites that include things like VPNs and password managers alongside the antivirus tools. Check out our list of thebest antivirus programsto learn more about these security suites. An antivirus tool’s real-time protection shouldn’t interfere with regular use of your computer. Deep scans will often slow things down by consuming RAM or CPU resources, but they shouldn’t make your computer totally unusable. For years, Avast Antivirus for Windows was the gold standard of antivirus, with consistently high rankings onAV-Test. We've included its antivirus in our list of recommended security app options before. However, early in 2024,the Federal Trade Commission fined Avast$16.5 million to settle charges that from 2014 to 2020 the company had sold customer browsing information to more than 100 third parties. The FTC claims that Avast allegedly collected the data through browser extensions and antivirus software and sold the data through its Jumpshot subsidiary. Then-Avast CEO Ondřej Vlček responded to the initial 2020 reports witha statementthat he understood that his company's actions raised questions of trust in his company. To address these concerns, Avast terminated Jumpshot data collection in January 2020 and closed its operations. We hope there will be no further Jumpshot-style activities and that Avast returns to glory as one of the best antivirus software options. Until then, we recommend using one of the other free options on this list. Kaspersky has historically been another top antivirus provider,earning high marks and awardsfor virus and malware protection from independent labs. However, in June of 2024, the US government announced afederal banprohibiting Kaspersky from selling antivirus or cybersecurity software or services in the US or to US citizens due to alleged ties between Kaspersky and the Russian government. “Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive US information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard US national security and the American people,"" Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in the official announcement of the ban. In a statement, Kaspersky said it ""does not engage in activities which threaten US national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted US interests and allies."" The Commerce Department recommends those who use Kaspersky software switch to replacement software from other security companies as soon as possible. To aid Kaspersky customers with the transition, Kaspersky will be allowed to provide antivirus updates to its software till Sept. 29, 2024, the department said. We use a three-step process to vet antivirus tools. First, we look at product pages to ensure that a tool is 100% free, and we analyze each app’s features. Next, we look through reviews of the antivirus software -- both from tech experts and from regular consumers on sites likeTrustpilot-- to gauge how effective and user-friendly the software is. We also look for scam alerts or other indications of shady business practices at this point. Finally, we consultAV-Test, an independent company with testing labs for antivirus software. AV-Test runs tests every two or three months (the exact testing cycle varies based on the product and operating system) and provides rankings for protection, usability and performance. An antivirus tool must have at least a 5 out of 6 ranking in all three categories to qualify for one of our best lists. Thefree version of Malwarebytesis one of the best tools for finding and removing malware on your computer. You can use the Malwarebytes scanner if you’re having performance issues and you think your regular antivirus software has missed something. However, Malwarebytes doesn’t offer real-time protection in the free version, so you’ll still need another antivirus software to protect your devices in the future. The best standalone free antivirus software is Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition. The best free digital security suite is AVG Antivirus Free. Yes, there are several 100% free antivirus programs available, including built-in antivirus software on Windows and MacOS devices, like Microsoft Defender and XProtect. Additionally, Bitdefender, AVG and Avira are all great options. Yes, it’s OK to use free antivirus software, especially if you’re strict about followinginternet safety rules. However, you might want to invest in paid antivirus software if you store personal data on your computer or use your computer for work. You’ll probably be safe with a free antivirus tool if you’re followingbasic internet safety rules. However, if you use your computer for work or store sensitive data on it, you may want to invest inpaid antivirus software. Many paid antivirus tools also come with additional layers of protection, like password managers andVPNs.",Keep your computer safe with these tried-and-tested free antivirus tools.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-free-antivirus/,
382,Best Live TV Streaming Service for Cord Cutters in 2024,"What to consider  Channel lineup Live TV streaming services may offer different packages and add-ons for viewers, but you want to ensure you can watch your local channels along with cable networks and on-demand videos. Not every service provides access to local programming (like PBS, ABC or NBC), sports or channels you'd typically find on cable and satellite TV. Compare channel lineups before choosing. Price You can choose a streaming service subscription that aligns with your budget, and there are multiple services available. Prices range from $25 to over $100 per month, depending on what you want. When considering costs, review the channel selection, cloud DVR abilities, price of premium add-ons, and how many devices you can stream on simultaneously. Simultaneous streams Take note of how many screens you can watch at a time. For example, YouTube TV allows you to stream on three devices at once, while Hulu grants you two, with the option to pay extra for more screens. Look for platform offerings that fit your household's needs. If you're looking tocut the cable cord,then live TV streaming services offer a convenient way to watch live TV without a contract. These are cable TV replacements and, unlike typicalon-demand services like Netflix, are designed to let you easily channel surf and access a live channel lineup. Our two top choices in this category are Hulu Plus Live TV and the budget-friendly Sling TV. Each service provides a blend of live channels with unlimited DVR and on-demand content. You can watch sports, news broadcasts, primetime TV shows and more, or opt to record it all and watch later. All you need is a phone,streaming deviceor asmart TV. What to consider  Channel lineup Live TV streaming services may offer different packages and add-ons for viewers, but you want to ensure you can watch your local channels along with cable networks and on-demand videos.

For example, YouTube TV allows you to stream on three devices at once, while Hulu grants you two, with the option to pay extra for more screens. Look for platform offerings that fit your household's needs. If you're looking for the cheapest live TV streaming service and one that is still able to offer a usable amount of channels, then it's without a doubt Sling TV Blue. Yet, things are a little more complicated than they are for Sling's competitors. You see, Sling tenders two different $40-ish-per-month live TV streaming channel packages, Sling Orange and Sling Blue. While a number of live TV channels are common to both, Orange is essentially the ESPN/Disney package, while Blue is the Fox/Discovery package. Meanwhile, Orange & Blue combines the two offerings for $60. Further, theaddition of ABC to eight marketshas increased its price there to $45 -- while it remains $40 in others. As a result, Sling TV may cost up to $20 more thanPhilo, but it still has better channels, more options and a comparatively better live TV streaming interface. Sling is also cheaper than most other streaming services,let alone cable. In addition to a relatively affordable price, Sling TV has two new feathers in its cap: an upgraded DVR (increased to 50 hours) and anew interface(as seen above), which makes the service a lot more fun to use. While Sling doesn't have a free trial, though it is currently offering half priice for the first month, but it does offer a cut-down version calledFreestreamwith a number of included channels. Top channels not available on Sling Blue: CBS, Animal Planet, Disney Channel, ESPN and Nickelodeon.ABC, Fox and NBC are available in select markets. Top channels not available on Sling Orange: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Animal Planet, Bravo, CNBC, Discovery Channel, Bravo, Fox News, Fox Sports 1, FX, MSNBC and USA Network. If you want the best mix of live streaming and on-demand, Hulu Plus Live TV is it. Its channel selection may not be as robust as YouTube TV or Fubo, but it's almost there -- especially with theaddition of PBS and Magnolia. Yet, it's Hulu's significant catalog of on-demand content that helps set it apart. The $83 service includes anunlimited DVRplus thead-supported version of the Disney Bundle(HuluBasic,Disney PlusandESPN Plus), and if you want the ad-free bundle, the price is $96. Hulu's exclusive titles such as The Bear andOnly Murders in the Building, plus its massive catalog of broadcast programming, grant it a content advantage no other service can match. Given that Hulu Plus Live TV offers you more with its live channels, it's the service to choose for live TV streaming. Look out for the price hike in October, however. Top channels not available on Hulu Plus Live TV:AMC, BBC America and NBA TV. YouTube TV hasmore top channelsthan any competitor at this price, and it was the first service to include local PBS stations -- Hulu and DirecTV Stream followed suit later. Due fora $10 price hikein January 2025, YouTube TV service has an excellent cloud DVR, including both unlimited storage and a generous nine months to watch recordings (most rivals offer 30 days). The user interface is no-nonsense, even if a little drab, and yet it offers most of the features a cable service can give you. YouTube TV is also the only one to offersurround sound on live broadcasts. YouTube TV is theexclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticketthrough the 2029-2030 season, withmonthly payment plans available. In addition, the video streaming service has a$20 monthly upgradethat lets you watch a limited number of 4K livestreams, download DVR recordings to your devices and watch an unlimited number of simultaneous streams (up from three). While Sling TV is cheaper, YouTube TV is still worth subscribing to if you want a tightly integrated search and a great channel selection. Top channels not available on YouTube TV:A&E, History, Lifetime and MLB Read our YouTube TV review. DirecTV Stream is the most expensive service at $87, but it does have some pluses, including the flipper-friendly ability to swipe left and right to change channels. The service also offers unlimited DVR capability to new users, while existing subscribers need to pay an extra $10 a month. For cord-cutters who want to follow their local NBA or MLB team, DirecTV Stream's $130 Choice package is a competitive live TV sports pick, because it has access to more regional sports networks than the competition. Additionally, DirecTV Stream includes channels some other services can't, includingalmost 250 local PBS stations. Top channels not available in base package:MLB Network, NFL Network and Travel Channel. We reviewed and tested these streaming services based on features, cost and channels. Yet, pricing and channel availability are two things that are still in a state of flux. For instance, YouTube TV is now $83, DirecTV Stream bumped its price up to $87, Fubo's basic package now costs $80 and Hulu Plus Live TV is now $83. Yet, change is all part of the brave new world of live TV streaming over the internet. While you are probably familiar with the services on this list, it's not fully reflective of every live TV platform available. If you're looking forfree TV there are a number of services, whileOTA (over the air)is also available if you hang an antenna. As we analyzed these streaming platforms, weconsidered a few things when testing.This list is ordered based on the numerical value I assigned to each streaming service in their individual review, which I determined by design (ease of use and layout), features (like 4K HDR, DVR and number of multiple streams), content (number of channels, sports offerings, add-on packages and quality of originals and catalogs) and value (price compared to these other factors). Click through to the full reviews for more details. Streaming TV services are great, but there are some things they can't do compared with a traditional cable box. First, it's worth looking at the channels that you can't get with any of these live TV streaming services. For example, only two of the services are currently able to offer PBS:YouTube TVandDirecTV Stream. Meanwhile, PBS local stations will roll out on Hulu with Live TV in the coming months. With sports, fans want to make sure they can find the sports channels to follow their teams. Most services carry ESPN and local channels for NFL football, but if you follow a professional baseball or basketball team, you might need its specific channel -- called a regional sports network or RSN -- to watch regular season games. RSN coverage varies widely for each service. Sometimes, even if you live in the right area, you may be mistakenly blacked out due to an IP address error. If this is the case, you can fix this bysigning up for a sports-friendly VPN. Live TV services can be streamed wherever you are with apps for every major device. Every live TV service's video streaming is afew seconds to a minute or more behindthe ""live"" stream you'll get from your local cable TV or satellite provider. That means you could get a preview of scores or big plays from Twitter, phone alerts or calls from friends slightly before you see the action on screen. If you're used to 5.1-channel surround offered by cable or even OTA, then you may be disappointed thatYouTube is the only serviceto offer surround sound on live broadcasts. The other services include stereo sound only on live channels, though 5.1 audio is available on some on-demand material. Each of the TV streaming services above offers a different mix ofchannels, so your first step should be choosingone that carries your ""can't miss"" cable channelsand shows. Some of the most important live channels are local, namely ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Not every service offers all of them in every area, but the best streaming service for you will include the majority of what you love to watch, so it's worth shopping around. The live TV streaming service lineups are in constant flux as networks scramble to secure access to popular channels (ones with highly watched original shows and regional sports networks are especially in demand). There's also the chance that a certain cable channel could disappear from a certain service after a network contract expires, which iswhat happened in 2020with theregional sports networks. These negotiations lead to other changes, too. Over the past few years,YouTube TV,Sling TV,Hulu(multiple times),Philoand DirecTV Stream have all raised their prices. Google and Rokuresolved a contract disputethat prevented users from downloading the YouTube TV app, while users lostDisney channels for two daysdue to a different dispute. Adding to this volatility is the fact that sometimes less popular services are simply phased out --AT&T TV Watch TV,TVisionandPlayStation Vueare just three examples. Broadly, each of these streaming services can be broken down into two main groups: budget, with prices ranging between $25 and $50 and few or no local channels; and premium, with prices from $70 and up, and local channels and superchargedcloud DVRs.That's right, all of the servicesallow you to record and playback shows, just like a traditional cable or satellite DVR, but they often come with restrictions. Next, there's the multistream question. If you want to watch more than one program at the same time -- for example, on your living room TV and on a bedroom TV, or the main TV and a tablet or other devices -- you'll want to make sure the video streaming service you're watching has enoughsimultaneous streams. Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time, and if you try to watch a second, it's blocked. Other services have higher simultaneous stream limits. Keep in mind that, especially if you do have more than one person watching at once on supported devices, you need to make sure you havefast, reliable broadband internet. A 100Mbps download service will cost around $50 to $60 a month, and sadly that's where the savings of cutting cable can get swallowed up. In 2024, streaming fans have more choices than ever, including NBC/Comcast'sPeacock, AT&T'sHBO Max,Apple TV PlusandDisney Plus. While Peacock differs slightly in that it has live news the other services lack traditional live channels -- focusing instead onback catalogs and new original programming-- but they can still eat into your entertainment budget. Netflix:Netflix is so popular that it's become a generic term for streaming in the same way as ""Magic Marker"" or even ""Coke"" in the South. Then there's the ever-popular ""Netflix and chill."" Ad-supportedplans now start at $7 a month, and the service offers thousands of TV shows and movies, including original TV series like Black Mirror and Stranger Things (be aware you may need to trade up to the $15.50 plan to watch some content). Then there areNetflix original moviesincluding Oscar winners Roma and The Power of the Dog. Prime Video: The ""other"" major streaming service, which is included as part of a $139 annual Prime Membership, or on its own for $9 a month. The interface isn't as user-friendly as Netflix, but the service also offers shows not on its rival, including original content likeThe Rings of Power, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Expanse. Amazon Prime also hasthe ability to add premium channels(HBO and Showtime and more), making it a potential one-stop shop. Disney Plus: One of the biggest streaming services to launch in some time, Disney has gathered a mix of movies, TV shows and exclusive content, including Loki, Andor and She-Hulk, starting at $8 a month.Read our Disney Plus review here. Peacock:Peacock is NBC's answer to Paramount Plus. Its main claim to fame is that its basic tier, with 7,500 hours of content, is free. Peacock Premium unlocks more content for $6 a month -- including exclusive shows such asPoker Faceand Mrs. Davis -- while an ad-lite version called Peacock Premium Plus is $12 monthly. Paramount Plus: Paramount Plus costs $6 a month or $12 monthly for ad-free streaming. The service offerslive TV for Premium subscribers, sports and on-demand content from CBS, MTV, BET, Nickelodeon and Paramount Network, plus its Paramount Pictures movie studio. Paramount Plus also offers exclusive originals such as Yellowjackets, 1923 and Picard. Vudu andMovies Anywhere: Digital libraries (or lockers) that incorporate legacyUltraViolet contentand streaming movies and TV that are only available for purchase, such as new releases. It's also worth investigating free, ad-supported services such asRoku Channel,Amazon Freevee, Tubi, Pluto and Crackle, which offer a wealth of content. ReadCNET's roundup of free TV services here. If you have a TV in your house -- that is, a screen that incorporates a tuner -- you're part way to cutting the cord already. Anaffordable indoor antenna hooked up to your TVwill let you watch free TV over the air from any channel you receive in your local broadcast area. Quality antennas cost as little as $20.See our comparison of indoor antennas here. You can also add a hardware DVR such as theTiVo Edge for Antennaif you want. Then you can record those live TV antenna channels, play them back and skip commercials, just like on a standard cable TV DVR. Here'sCNET's roundup of the best OTA DVRs for cord-cutters. A solid, lower-cost alternative to live TV streaming services is the combination of an antenna for live local channels and an on-demand service such as Netflix or Hulu. That way you'll still be able to watch live programming and also have a choice of on-demand content. Streaming live TV services are still in flux. Since launching, every single service has increased its prices by at least $10 a month, TV channel selections are changing all the time and some services have even closed. While live TV streaming is here to stay, and cable is increasingly left in the past, it will be some time before both prices and the services offered settle in.

383,Best Windows Laptop for 2024,"CNET's expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. What to consider Price The current sweet spot for a reliable laptop to handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800. For a model suitable for creative work or gaming, plan to spend $1,000 and up. Every brand of laptop can be found discounted online at one time or another, so it pays to track deals to find the lowest price. Operating System For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things, but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. MacBooks currently start at $999, so if you need a laptop for significantly less, it’s Windows. A Chromebook running on Google’s ChromeOS is an excellent (and less expensive) alternative, but it can’t run Windows or Mac software. Size Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen, which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Screen When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: size, resolution, what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. Higher resolutions are better for fitting more on a screen and look for a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb. Processor Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops with Qualcomm emerging as a third option with its Arm-baed Snapdragon X chips. Apple makes its own Arm-based chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. You'll still want to pay attention to the number of cores -- the more, the better -- to gauge potential performance as well as Intel x86 vs Arm. Graphics For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's better for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. For things like video editing, gaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU. Memory We highly recommend 16GB of RAM, with 8GB being the absolute minimum. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and the slower storage drive. Storage You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in most models. A 256GB SSD is the minimum, and 512GB will last longer without getting filled up. Opt for 1TB or more if you work with large video files or plan to store a large game library on your laptop. At CNET, we test all kinds of laptops, from budget models for everyday tasks to high-performance laptops for gaming, content creation and everything in between. Each member of our team has decades of experience testing and reviewing laptops. We conduct performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use. This helps us find not only the best laptop overall but also the best laptop for your needs and in your price range. Here, you'll find our top Windows laptops from Microsoft, HP, Qualcomm, Dell and more.

We really like the look and long battery life of the newMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7Copilot Plus PC, but theHP Pavilion Plus 14remains our pick as the best overall Windows laptop. It doesn't have the battery life of the Surface Laptop 7, but it also lacks the potential compatibility issues you might run into with a laptop with neither an Intel nor an AMD CPU but an Arm-basedQualcomm Snapdragon Xprocessor. We love the Pavilion Plus 14 for its all-metal enclosure, strong performance and gorgeous OLED display. Sitting between the meat-and-potatoes Pavilion line and the higher-end Envy line, the Pavilion Plus series offers attractive features at affordable prices. The Pavilion Plus 14 would make a good match for many people shopping for a Windows laptop. Other models we've tested and reviewed are great fits for narrower audiences, from budget models and two-in-one convertibles to high-powered gaming laptops. With decades of experience testing and reviewing laptops, our laptop experts conduct performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and also perform extensive hands-on tests to assess the design, features and performance of each laptop we review. You'll find a good number of recommendations here, but we also have more specific picks in different laptop categories, starting with thebest overall laptopand also including thebest gaming laptop,best cheap gaming laptop,best laptop for college studentsandbest two-in-one laptop. If you narrowed it to a specific brand, check out our picks for thebest Dell laptopandbest HP laptop. Beyond Windows, we have recommendations for thebest MacBookandbest Chromebook. We also have a list of thebest laptops and tablets for giftingthis holiday season that can often be found on sale this month. There are a lot of Windows laptops. A lot. Which makes narrowing it down to just one more than a little tricky. The HP Pavilion Plus is exemplary because it can meet the needs of a lot of people while still being affordable. It’s available in 14- and 16-inch sizes; we tested the 14-inch model, which is small enough for travel but big enough that you won’t feel cramped while working. HP offers AMD and Intel processors, which can also be configured with entry-level discrete graphics. There are also multiple displays to match your budget, including a beautiful OLED panel. The starting price is $1,000, but HP regularly discounts it by hundreds of dollars. We tested an AMD model, and HP still sells both AMD and Intel configurations of the Pavilion Plus 14, but the customizable model with the cheap OLED upgrade is now an Intel-based unit with a Core Ultra CPU. We recommend getting that OLED screen; It adds only $60 to the package and is worth it -- especially when you can find it on sale and get the OLED upgrade for little more than $700 in total. That's a great price for a well-rounded, well-built laptop with an OLED display. SCORE Power in motion. AI-ready. The XPS 14 balances performance and mobility in a striking form factor. Create on the go with its lightweight 3.7-pound design, slim 18mm size and long battery life. It's powered by AI-enabled Intel Core Ultra processors. SCORE The Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-based efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited compatibility. Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved, and so has compatibility. We saw a strong overall performance from the Snapdragon X Elite processor and jaw-dropping battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that’s the longest runtime of any 13- or 14-inch laptop we ever reviewed -- including the M3 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build. We wish there was an OLED display option, and you’ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you’ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. You don't necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations that start at $900 should meet the needs of most people. SCORE Dell’s new Copilot Plus PC lasted for more than 23 hours on our YouTube streaming battery drain test. That's longer than any laptop we've tested in the past year and one of the longest laptop runtimes we have ever seen. Inspiron 14 Plus 7441’s design is fairly basic and doesn't match the sleekness of Microsoft’s own Copilot Plus PC, the Surface Laptop 7, or Apple’s MacBook Air, but the Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 still supplies a rigid, all-metal chassis and crisp, 2.5K IPS display. At just $1,000, it's a bit more affordable than Microsoft’s and Apple’s models and is a great pick for a general-purpose, long-lasting laptop. SCORE The Dell XPS 16 9640 has a striking, minimalistic design that features a borderless touchpad, a nearly flat keyboard with little to no spacing between the keys and a Function row that consists not of physical keys but touch-sensitive icons. Powering the 4K OLED display is a powerful duo of an Intel Core Ultra CPU and up to RTX 4070 graphics. At $3,200, our XPS 16 9640 test system costs less than the $3,999 configuration of the mostly maxed-out MacBook Pro 16 we tested at the end of last year but is still at the high-end of the premium laptop class. It offers the design and performance that befits its price and Dell's numerous customization options mean you can likely land on a configuration that meets your needs and budget. SCORE It delivers no surprises or revolutionary upgrades from past iterations, but the ThinkPad X1 Carbon's security features, build quality and performance remain excellent. Its 14-inch display and 2.5-pound weight are the sweet spot of enough screen space to work long stretches without needing to connect to an external display, while also being light enough for daily travel. With an industry-best keyboard, long battery life and greener construction, the X1 Carbon Gen 11 is a near-perfect business laptop. Lenovo has increased pricing from previous Gen 11 to Gen 12 models to where we've reached a point where the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is no longer our recommendation for business execs unless your organization is large enough to qualify for volume pricing. For individual buyers, it's simply too expensive for the performance, and battery life it provides. For most business users, the previous Gen 11 is the better buy -- especially for just $1,349 at Walmart. SCORE For just $300, Acer’s entry-level Aspire Go 14 holds its own against other budget models that cost twice as much or even more. The design can't be described as enticing or exciting, but it's functional and unlikely to offend. Performance from the quad-core AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series CPU and 8GB of RAM suffices for basic use, and its battery life is surprisingly long. The 14-inch display features a modern 16:10 aspect ratio and is sufficiently bright, but it suffers from poor viewing angles that might take some getting used to before you settle on the right angle to position the display. Another drawback is the tight storage of the laptop’s meager 128GB SSD. Neither drawback is a deal-breaker when you consider the bargain-basement price. The Aspire Go 14 provides great value with its acceptable build quality, capable performance and long battery life. SCORE Like other gaming laptop makers, Acer has two lines: a budget-friendly Nitro series and midrange and premium models that carry the Predator label. Oddly enough, it's under the latter you'll find our budget gaming pick: the Helios Neo 16. It's strikingly similar to the Acer Nitro 16 but with slightly better build quality and graphics performance. The only place it really faltered was its speakers, which put out disappointingly flat audio with nonexistent bass. The Predator Helios Neo 16 with a Core i5 CPU and RTX 4050 graphic cost $1,200 when we reviewed it. That model is no longer available, but a higher-end Core i7/RTX 4060 model is for just $1,150.  SCORE One of the first of the new generation of 18-inch laptops, the m18 is now in its second R2 iteration. It can get expensive if you push it up to a high configuration -- an RTX 4090 and Core i9-14900HX exceeds $3,000. If the big screen is most important to you, it starts at $1,900 with a respectable Core i7-14650HX and RTX 4060. Don't expect great battery life, and the fans can get loud when you're pushing it. SCORE With its excellent build quality, adequate display, strong performance and lengthy runtime, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use or students. It's a great deal at its price of $900 at Best Buy and an even better deal at its regularly discounted price of $800 direct from Lenovo. We like its solid, all-metal chassis and the power and efficiency you get from its AMD Ryzen 7 8000-series CPU. It lacks some of the refinement and extras you get with Lenovo’s flagship Yoga 9i 14, but the midrange Yoga 7 14 is much more affordable and the better pick for most people. SCORE Two items help make the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 our favorite two-in-one detachable laptop: Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Elite X processor and an excellent OLED display. The Arm-based CPU delivers competitive performance and far fewer compatibility issues for mainstream use than previous Windows-on-Arm efforts. And it helps the Surface Pro 11 deliver a long runtime. The 13-inch OLED display supplies a crisp, 2.8K resolution along with P3 calibration and real HDR capability. It's the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in a while, but you still have to pay extra for a keyboard and stylus. The Surface Pro 11 starts at $1,000 but costs can quickly escalate. For example, the Flex keyboard with Slim pen adds a hefty $450 to our test system, which costs $1,700 for a Snapdragon Elite X processor, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. SCORE The X1 Fold is still more of a proof-of-concept product than a mass-market device, but it’s the best foldable laptop we’ve seen to date. It feels cramped in laptop mode when the display is folded into a small, 12-inch screen. It works better as an all-in-one with the 16.3-inch OLED display unfolded and propped up against the separate kickstand with the Bluetooth keyboard in front of it. The kickstand can hold the display in either landscape or portrait mode, and it works well in either orientation. The ThinkPad X1 Fold 16 puts us one step closer to getting a foldable laptop that's more than just a curiosity for deep-pocketed early adopters. Its design is sleeker than that ofAsus’s thick and clunky Zenbook 17 Fold. Its price is much more reasonable thanHP’s Spectre Foldable PC. Lenovo has dropped the price of the X1 to where it now starts at around $1,900. Our test system with the keyboard folio included rings in at just over $2,300. SCORE Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i: It's thin and light for its size, but a short runtime and a few design miscues make this a low-cost laptop to skip. Acer Swift Go 14 AI: This Snapdragon X-powered laptop can run all day, but its overall look might put you to sleep. Acer Swift 14 AI: It’s a long-lasting if basic Copilot Plus PC, but do we really need an AI indicator light on the touchpad? Lenovo ThinkBook 14 2-in-1 Gen 4: I wish you could upgrade the display, but this low-cost two-in-one business laptop lets you add more RAM and a second SSD after purchase to extend your investment. Lenovo Yoga 7 16 Gen 9: Lenovo's 16-inch convertible is a good budget buy, but it's better as a secondary machine than your daily driver. Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 Gen 9: Lenovo's flagship two-in-one has AV advantages over its midrange sibling, but you'll pay a premium price for the OLED display and quad speakers. Asus Zenbook S 14: Intel's Core Ultra Series 2 processors show improvement from the first generation, but Apple's and Qualcomm's ARM-based chips still lead the way. HP OmniBook X 14: The latest Copilot Plus PC runs for more hours than there are hours in a day. Lenovo LOQ 15IAX9I: It's super cheap, with a dedicated Intel Arc GPU that lends it a wee bit of 3D muscle for casual 1080p play. HP Envy x360 16: This midrange convertible impresses with a premium OLED display. Its AMD Ryzen 8040 series CPU makes it pretty fast too. Asus ROG Zephyrus G16: It's a top gaming laptop for creators too. Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 7445: A dim display dulls Dell's otherwise well-rounded, AI-equipped and affordable 14-inch convertible laptop. Acer Swift X 14 (2024): The design won't wow you, but the 14.5-inch OLED display powered by RTX 4070 graphics is a great combo for on-the-go content creation. Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7640: Content creators may bemoan the display choices, but this midtier, 16-inch laptop offers well-rounded performance from its Core Ultra chip and RTX graphics. Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Q425: It's a boon to get an OLED display in such a portable package with great battery life for roughly $1,000, but the fit and finish feel decidedly midrange. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12: The latest X1 Carbon has many charms, but they will remain out of reach for many business buyers constrained by budgets. Dell XPS 14 9440: The radical look is sure to turn heads, but some of the daring design elements could be turnoffs. HP Omen Transcend 14: Neither a featureless slab nor a carnival of lights, HP's latest 14-inch Omen has its own unique flair. It doesn't scrimp on substance, either. Lenovo Slim 7i: With an OLED display and a solid build, this is a rugged option for mainstream shoppers, but other touches are decidedly midrange. Dell Inspiron 14 Plus 7440: For a reasonable $1,000, this 14-inch Dell model based on an Intel Core Ultra CPU lets you be productive and remain portable Alienware m16 R2: This middle-class option for mainstream gaming fares better than average and is a sensible option for 1440p play. Acer Predator Triton 14: With fast performance and a bright HDR screen, this mainstream 14-inch gaming laptop can be a great gaming value. M3 MacBook Air 13: Apple's 2024 MacBook Air update is a straightforward performance boost to power you through the future of work, school and play at home or away. The review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. We test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, includingPrimate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6,Cinebench R23,PCMark 10, a variety of3DMarkbenchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks fromGuardians of the Galaxy,The Rift Breaker(CPU and GPU) andShadow of the Tomb Raider. For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price. The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on ourHow We Test Computerspage. There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment, and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking. The search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it, which holds whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop capability as you can afford from the start. Generally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capability for less. Choosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS too. When it comes to price and variety (and, again, PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, but the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you'll have to consider older refurbished ones. Windows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to, but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist. If you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows. Make sure the applications you need have aChrome, Android or Linux app before making the leap. If you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they're a good fit. Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Laptop size is primarily determined by screen size, which factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn't necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can't expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on. When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: how much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. You really want to optimize pixel density, which is the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen atDPI Calculatorif you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) We recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb. Because of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to view a wide spreadsheet, for example. If you need a laptop with relatively accurate color, that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can't simply trust the specs. This is because manufacturers usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides forgeneral-purpose monitors,creators,gamers and HDR viewing. The processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with itsArm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head toIntel'sorAMD'ssites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be. Apple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. Like Intel and AMD, you'll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance. Battery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple's Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-basedCopilot Plus PCswe've tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD. The graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated or discrete. As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU. Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU. For more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs. For memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded. Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls. You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives. If the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. Get what you can afford, and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: We don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game. Setting a budget is a good place to start when shopping for the best laptop for yourself. The good news is you can get a nice-looking, lightweight laptop with excellent battery life at prices under $500. If you're shopping for a laptop around $500 or less, check out our top picks here, as well as morespecific buying advice for that price range. Higher-end components like Intel Core i-series and AMD Ryzen processors and premium design touches like thin-display bezels and aluminum or magnesium bodies have made their way to laptops priced between $500 and $1,000. You can also find touchscreens and two-in-one designs that can be used as a tablet or a laptop and a couple of other positions in between. In this price range, you'll also find faster memory and more SSD storage to improve performance. Above $1,000 is where you'll find premium laptops and two-in-ones. If you're looking for the fastest performance, the best battery life, the slimmest, lightest designs and top-notch display quality with adequate screen size, expect to spend at least $1,000. Deciding between MacOS and Windows laptops will come down to personal preference and budget for most people. Apple's base model laptop, the M1 MacBook Air, starts at $999. You can sometimes find it discounted or you can get educational pricing from Apple and other retailers. In general, it'll be at least $1,000 for a new MacBook, and the prices just go up from there. For the money, you're getting great hardware top to bottom, inside and out. Apple recently moved to using its own processors, which resulted inacross-the-board performance improvementscompared to older Intel-based models. The company's most powerful laptop, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, still hasn't been updated to Apple silicon. Again, that great hardware comes at a price. Also, you're limited to just Apple laptops. With Windows and Chromebooks (more on these below), you get an amazing variety of devices at a wide range of prices. Software between the two is plentiful, so unless you need to run something that's available only on one platform or the other, you should be fine to go with either. Gaming is an advantage for a Windows laptop. MacOS is also considered to be easier and safer to use than Windows, especially for people who want their computers to get out of the way so they can get things done. Over the years, Microsoft has done its best to follow suit and, withWindows 11 here,it's trying to remove any barriers. Also, while Macs might have a reputation for being safer, with the popularity of the iPhone and iPad helping to drive Mac sales,they've become bigger targets for malware. Yes, they are, but they're not for everyone.Google's Chrome OS has come a long way in the 10-plus yearssince they arrived and Chromebooks -- laptops that run on Chrome OS -- are great for people who do most of their work in a web browser or using mobile apps. They are secure, simple more often than not, a bargain. What they can't do is natively run Windows or Mac software. The pandemic changed how and where a lot of people work. The small, ultraportable laptops valued by people who regularly travel may have suddenly become woefully inadequate for working from home. Or maybe instead of needing long battery life, you'd rather have a bigger display with more graphics power for gaming. If you're going to be working on a laptop and don't need more mobility than moving it from room to room, consider a 15.6-inch laptop or larger. In general, a bigger screen makes life easier for work and is more enjoyable for entertainment, and it also is better if you're using it as an extended display with an external monitor. It typically means you're getting more ports, so connecting an external display or storage or a keyboard and mouse is easier without requiring a hub or dock. For travel, stay with 13- or 14-inch laptops or two-in-ones. They'll be the lightest and smallest while still delivering excellent battery life. What's nice is that PC-makers are moving away from 16:9 widescreens toward 16:10- or 3:2-ratio displays, which gives you more vertical screen space for work without significantly increasing the footprint. These models usually don't have discrete graphics or powerful processors, althoughthat's not always the case. You can play games and create content on any laptop. What games you play and what content you create -- and the speed at which you do them -- varies greatly depending on the components inside the laptop. For casual browser-based games or using game-streaming services likeNvidia GeForce NowandXbox Cloud Gaming, you don't need a powerful gaming laptop. Similarly, if you're trimming video clips, cropping photos or live-streaming video from your webcam, you can get by with a modestly priced laptop or Chromebook with integrated graphics. For anything more demanding, you'll need to invest more money in discrete graphics like Nvidia's RTX 30- or 40-series GPUs. Increased system memory of 16GB or more, having a speedy SSD of at least 512GB for storage and a faster processor such as an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 will all help you get things moving faster, too. The other piece you'll want to consider is the display. For gaming, look for screens with a high refresh rate of 120Hz or faster so games look smoother while playing. For content creation, look for displays that cover at least 100% sRGB color space or, better yet, 100% DCI-P3.","Looking for a new laptop?

384,73% of iPhone Owners Say 'No Thanks' to Apple Intelligence: New Data Echoes CNET's Findings,"As Apple rolls out the latestApple Intelligencefeatures for the iPhone iniOS 18.2, a new survey from the trade journalSellCellindicates that 73% of iPhone owners and 87% of Samsung owners claim new AI features ""add little to no value"" to their phone experiences. The new report echoes a similar CNET survey from late August 2024, which found that battery life and storage capacity are much bigger factors in purchase decisions for people upgrading their smartphones. GenZ was a little more willing to pay for AI than Millennials, GenX or Boomers, and they were also less concerned about privacy risks. Here's everything that the CNET survey found. As smartphone makers like Apple, Google and Samsung place a growing emphasis on AI features in their latest devices, the CNET survey found a quarter of smartphone owners don't find those capabilities particularly useful, and just 18% say AI integrations are their main motivator for upgrading their phone. The biggest drivers for buying a new device, according to CNET respondents, are longer battery life (61%), more storage (46%) and better camera features (38%). This comes as Apple rolls out its latest batch ofApple Intelligencefeatures withiOS 18.2, including ChatGPT integration for Siri, the ability to create custom emoji withGenmojiand a text-to-image tool calledImage Playground. The iPhone maker debuted its first set of AI-powered capabilities in October, which includes asmarter Siri,AI-powered writing toolsandphoto editing. Apple Intelligence is available oniPhone 15 Pro modelsand theiPhone 16lineup (as well as iPad and Mac models with the M1 chip and later). iPhone 16 owners also get access toVisual Intelligence, a visual search tool that can help identify objects and places around you and surface any relevant information. Google also leaned heavily into AI features when it unveiled thePixel 9series in August, spending much of its keynotediscussing new Gemini functionslikeLive, which lets you have a natural-sounding, back-and-forth conversation with the virtual assistant. At its JulyUnpackedevent, Samsung similarly toutedGalaxy AI, which can simplify tasks like translating messages and editing photos. These new features rely on generative AI to produce text or images or to enhance digital assistants, AI itself has been embedded in smartphones for years. For instance, your phone's camera uses AI to process images and blur backgrounds in Portrait mode, and Siri and Google Assistant have always been AI-based (albeit using less advanced versions of the tech). Because this new wave of AI introduces ways to more explicitly accomplish tasks on your phone, rather than blending into existing features, it may take some time for people to warm up to it. As tech giants continue to roll out these AI functions, consumers may soon have to pay the price if they want to keep using them. Samsung's website says its Galaxy AI features ""will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices."" To utilize Gemini's full power across Google's apps, you'll need to subscribe toGemini Advanced. It's likely Apple could also somedaycharge for some of its AI-powered iPhone features. Manyconsumers aren't sold. In CNET's September survey, nearly half of smartphone owners said they're not willing to pay extra money to access AI on their phones. That's not much of a surprise, given how much subscription fatigue is already weighing people down. AnotherCNET studyfrom April found that US adults spend an average of $91 on subscription services every month. Two-thirds of respondents said at least one of their subscriptions got more expensive within the last year. Adding yet another monthly fee may not be so enticing. Still, there are those who are eager to tap into AI on their phones, with Gen Zers and Millennials being the most enthused: CNET's survey found that 20% of respondents from each generation say they're excited about AI capabilities and find them helpful. Additionally, 15% of Gen Zers and 16% of Millennials use AI on their phones for tasks like photo editing, image creation and summarizing or writing text. Also, 20% of Gen Zers and 19% of Millennials regularly use an AI tool like ChatGPT or Google Gemini on their smartphones. Privacy remains a key concern when it comes to AI, with one-third (34%) of smartphone owners in CNET's survey flagging their unease in that department. Tech giants have placed a growing emphasis on privacy considerations during their AI-focused keynotes. At itsWorldwide Developers Conferencein June, for instance, Apple noted many of itsAI models run on-device, which is generally considered more private since information doesn't have to travel over the internet. When a task calls for more computational power, relevant data will be sent toApple Silicon servers, and that datawon't be storedor made accessible to Apple, the company says. With AI being among the last reasons consumers want to upgrade their smartphones, other considerations like longer battery life, more storage and better camera features still dominated CNET's survey. Other motivators include phone display and screen size (32%); keeping the same ecosystem, like iOS or Android (24%); and phone color (10%). With the high cost of devices (many flagship phones will cost you anywhere between $800 and $1,200), consumers may not want toupgrade their devices as frequently. According to our survey, 44% claim they only get a new device when their current phone breaks or needs replacing. Further, 30% hang onto their devices for three years or longer, while 18% upgrade every two years and just 8% get a new phone every year. Luckily for consumers, Apple didn't implement a price hike with theiPhone 16. Still, iPhone users hold onto their devices for longer than other smartphone owners; one-third will wait three years or more for an upgrade. Companies like Google and Samsung have continued to roll out foldable phones, with the latest being thePixel 9 Pro Foldand theGalaxy Z FlipandFold 6, respectively. Consumers still feel lukewarm about the concept of a foldable handheld device. Just over half (52%) of smartphone owners say they're not interested in buying a foldable phone, while 13% say they'd be interested sometime in the next two years. That gives Apple, which has yet to enter the foldable phone space, the opportunity to tap into that interest. Experts have long speculated that afoldable iPhonecould be what it takes to spur wider adoption of foldable smartphones. It may be several years before that happens if it ever does. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. The total sample size was 2,484 adults, including 2,387 smartphone owners. Fieldwork was undertaken Aug. 28-30, 2024. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18-plus).","Neither Apple nor Samsung smartphone owners seem to have much interest in new AI features, according to a new trade survey.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/73-of-iphone-owners-say-no-thanks-to-apple-intelligence-new-data-echoes-cnets-findings/,
385,Best Bluetooth Speaker for 2024,"What to consider  Budget Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker. Size Be sure to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. Durability Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, consider a more durable speaker. Speakerphone capabilities Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. vs   I've tested hundreds of portable Bluetooth speakers dating all the way back to theJawbone Mini Jamboxand have had hands-on experience with all the speakers on this list and fully reviewed many of them. Yes, several speakers on this list are fairly pricey premium models. But I've also included a bunch of budget picks, some of which cost less than $50. In our testing, we evaluate sound quality, battery life and design, as well as how good a value the speaker is at its given price. If you're looking for bigger Bluetooth speakers that pack more punch, we also have a list of thebest Bluetooth boom boxesthat's worth checking out. What to consider  Budget Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker. Size Be sure to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. Durability Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, consider a more durable speaker. Speakerphone capabilities Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. I liked the original Soundcore Motion Boom, which made our best Bluetooth speakers list and was one of the better mini boom box Bluetooth speaker values over the last few years, selling for around $80. The3.75-pound Boom 2costs more but sounds substantially better, with more than double the power rating of the original, so it not only plays louder but kicks out more bass and offers better clarity at higher volumes (it's equipped with two tweeters and one subwoofer). It also has a couple of built-in LED lights to help create that party vibe. It's an impressive-sounding speaker for its size and a good value. Waterproof (IPX7-rated) with a floatable design, the speaker's battery life is rated at up to 24 hours at moderate volume levels (it charges via USB-C) and you can tweak the sound and customize the lighting with the Soundcore app for iOS and Android. There's also a USB-out port to charge your devices. The best way to describe Bose's new SoundLink Home speaker is as the spiritual successor to the SoundLink Mini 2, which was quietly discontinued in late 2018. Available in two color options, the SoundLink Home is a portable Bluetooth speaker with up to 9 hours of battery life, but it has more of an indoor design, with an aluminum chassis and no water resistance (you can move it around but it's not a speaker you'd take to the beach or take camping). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and weighing slightly more than 2 pounds, it's able to deliver an impressive amount of bass sound for its compact size. Overall, it sounds excellent for a mini Bluetooth speaker, featuring decent clarity and bigger sound than the SoundLink Flex. Like any small speaker, it does have its sound limitations (if you push the volume up with certain tracks, it can sound a bit restrained in certain frequencies as its digital processing seeks to prevent distortion). Pairing two of these speakers together as a stereo pair does produce significantly better sound and you can link the speaker directly to a computer, smartphone or tablet with a USB-C cable for wired sound (it does sound slightly better in wired USB-C mode). On a more critical note, it's somewhat expensive and doesn't link to Bose's companion app for headphones and other Bluetooth speakers, so you can't tweak the sound profile. SCORE When the SoundLink Flex speaker launched, Bose made some bold claims about its new Bluetooth speaker, particularly its bass performance. It mostly lived up to the hype and is arguably the best-sounding wireless speaker for its compact size. A 2nd Gen model quietly arrived in October of 2024 that adds a few new features, including a new customizable shortcut button, Bose app compatibility (you can now tweak the sound profile with an equalizer and create a SimpleSync connection with another compatible Bose product) and support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs. It's also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 4.2. Those aren't major upgrades, but they do make an excellent portable Bluetooth speaker slightly better. The 2nd gen SoundLink Flex is available in black, blue dusk, sandstone and a new alpine sage color. Like the original, it's equipped with Bose's PositionIQ technology to automatically detect the speaker's orientation and deliver optimized sound based on whether it's upright, hanging or flat on its back. SCORE The Beats Pill of 2024 has improved in some key ways from its predecessor, particularly when it comes to sound quality, durability, battery life and price point. I do like the form factor and lighter weight of the Bose SoundLink Flex. The Pill does have a few extras like USB-C audio wired mode and speakerphone functionality that are appealing. You'll have to decide how important those extras are when weighing the Pill against the Bose SoundLink Flex. Any way you look at it, the Pill is a very good compact Bluetooth speaker. Like the Bose, it's an easy portable wireless speaker to recommend, especially if its price dips by $20 to $30, as the SoundLink Flex's price sometimes does during flash sales. SCORE Tribit's StormBox Flow is another Bose SoundLink Flex knockoff for less that shares some similarities with the Soundcore Motion 300, including the same list price. The Tribit may sound slightly better than the Motion 300, edging it out for bass performance by a tad, but the Anker speaker wins on design. Like the Bose SoundLink Flex, the Tribit StormBox Flow can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up. You can also wirelessly pair two of the speakers together for stereo sound. It has an IP67 rating, which means it's dust-resistant and fully waterproof. Tribit says it delivers up to 30 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. That's impressive. When I first heard about the SoundLink Max, I was a little surprised Bose would put out a $399 Bluetooth speaker after the $149 SoundLink Flex speaker did so well. The Flex was so successful because it not only sounds good for its compact size but it doesn't cost that much, at least not for a Bose product. Not surprisingly, the 4.89-pound Max also sounds impressive -- it may just be the best-sounding for its size -- and has a premium design with a built-in rope handle that's replaceable (the Max is fully waterproof and dust-proof). It's a great Bluetooth speaker, but its high price tag may turn some folks off. SCORE The Soundcore by Anker Select Go 4 doesn't have quite the build quality as JBL's Go 4 micro Bluetooth speaker (it has a slight budget feel to it), but it offers comparable sound quality and costs half the price. Like the JBL Go 4, the similarly named Select Go 4 sounds decent for its tiny size and is able to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Also, it's fully waterproof and even floats. Battery life is rated for an impressive 20 hours at moderate volumes and you can pair two of these speakers together for stereo sound. It's definitely a good value. New for 2024, Tribit has released a second-gen version of its popular Stormbox Blast Bluetooth boom box speaker. The Stormbox Blast 2 has an upgraded design -- it's less boxy and generic looking than the original -- along with upgraded speaker drivers and two inputs for wired microphones for karaoke (the microphones are sold separately). The speaker is quite beefy, weighing in at 15.8 pounds, and it's rated for 200 watts of power, with an 80-watt subwoofer, dual 45-watt mid-range drivers and two 15-watt tweeters. This thing plays loud, has powerful bass (I mainly kept the bass boost mode engaged) and measures up well against more premium Bluetooth boom box speakers from JBL and Sony that cost about twice as much. Like the original, this also has a light show component -- it's customizable or can be turned off -- and the speaker is fully waterproof with an IP67 rating. The Sormbox Bast 2 is rated for an impressive 30 hours of battery at moderate volume levels with the light show-off, but battery life does drop significantly when you really crank the volume. Also worth noting: there's a charge-out port, and interestingly, the speaker can be charged with a USB-C cable or the included two-prong power cord. Bose makes its excellent SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker that sells for around $150 and sometimes goes on sale for less. The Soundcore Motion 300 is Anker's answer to that Bose speaker. Around the same size as the Bose, it doesn't sound quite as good, but it sounds impressive for its compact size and lists for only $80 (it's been on sale for as low as $55). Like the SoundLink Flex, it can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up toward the ceiling or propped up as shown in the photo above. It's IPX7 waterproof and delivers up to 13 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. There's also support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android and other devices that support Bluetooth wireless streaming with LDAC. The speaker has a bass-boost button that does amp up the low end a bit, but I actually thought the speaker sounded a little better without the bass boost engaged because it seemed slightly overdriven with the boost. SCORE Sonos'soriginal Roamspeaker sounded very good for its compact size, but many users complained that it was tricky to go from Wi-Fi mode at home and Bluetooth mode on the go. With the release of the new Roam 2, which comes in five color options, those connectivity issues go away. The reality is the Roam 2 isn't much of an upgrade. It has the same acoustic architecture (and the same impressive sound for its size), but now it has two buttons -- one for power and the other for Bluetooth -- instead of a single power button. That Bluetooth button lets you pair the speaker with any Bluetooth-enabled audio device right out of the box. Previously, the setup was more convoluted and required you to connect to your Sonos home Wi-Fi network first. Not too long ago, Ultimate Ears released its higher-end Epicboom Bluetooth speaker, which sounds very good but is pretty pricey at $300 and somewhat large. The newer Everboom is about half the size, weighing in at 2.1 pounds (the Epicboom weighs 4.36 pounds), and more travel-friendly. It can't produce as much sound or bass as the Epicboom, but it does play relatively loud, and I was in some ways more impressed with its sound than the Epicboom's. By that I mean for its size, it's one of the best-sounding speakers out there, delivering punchy bass and nicely detailed sound. Fully waterproof (it floats) and dustproof with an IP67 rating, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and can be wirelessly linked up with most of UE's current family of Boom Bluetooth speakers, which includes the Boom 4, Megaboom 4, Epicboom and Hyperboom. Alas, the only strike against it is its relatively high price tag ($250). Harman Kardon, which is owned by Samsung, makes popular JBL Bluetooth speakers like the Flip 6 and JBL Charge. The under-the-radar Harman Kardon Luna may just be the best mini Bluetooth speaker you've never heard of. It's not only attractively designed -- it comes in black or white -- but sounds surprisingly good for its size, with clear, natural sound and punchy bass (it's a mono speaker with a dual-driver design that features a woofer and a tweeter). It's slightly bigger than JBL's Flip series speakers and slightly smaller than the JBL Charge series, but the Luna's got a bit of heft to it, weighing in at 1.56 pounds (0.71 kg). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, it's also fully waterproof and dustproof, with an IP67 rating. Battery life is rated at up to 12 hours at moderate volume levels. I did find it to be a better-sounding speaker than the JBL Flip 6 and preferred it in some ways to the JBL Charge 5. The Tribit XSound Plus 2 is the successor to the similarly priced MaxSound Plus, which was a very good value. The XSound Plus 2 plays a little louder (it has a 30-watt vs. 24-watt power rating) and also has a slightly better battery (up to 24 hours at 50% volume vs. 20 hours). Additionally, this speaker is equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and is able to connect to the Tribit app and link up in party mode with Tribit's XSound Plus 2, SormBox Flow and StormBox 2 Bluetooth speakers. The speaker, which weighs in at 1.28 pounds, does play quite loud for its size and delivers an ample amount of bass. The sound can be a bit uneven (the speaker sounds very good with some tracks and a little brash with others), but you can tweak the sound profile with some EQ settings, including three preset sound modes built into the speaker itself. Overall, the speaker seems pretty durable and has a removable lanyard and an IPX7 rating, which means it's fully waterproof. It does have speakerphone capabilities as well as an auxiliary input. Sony launched the SRS-XB23 a few years ago, and it was a fairly popular portable Bluetooth speaker. The lightweight and compact ULT Field 1 sort of looks like a cross between the XB23 and the newer SRS-XE200. It sounds significantly better than the XB23, which had bass forward sound but just didn't offer enough clarity and detail for my tastes. The ULT Field 1 sounds fuller and more balanced and competes favorably with JBL's popular Flip 6, which lists for the same price. The speaker comes in four colors: off-white, orange, black and forest gray, and it's waterproof and dust-proof, with an IP67 rating. It also has speakerphone capabilities and is rated for up to 12 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. When you press the ULT button, you get a bass boost and overall fuller sound. Unlike with the ULT button on the Wear headphones that I thought boosted the bass too much, in the case of the Field 1, the speaker didn't have enough bass unless the ULT button was engaged. Marshall's 2023 Middleton speaker isn't exactly compact. It also isn't so beefy that you get a workout carrying it around. Weighing 4 pounds (1.8kg), it's bigger than Marshall's Emberton speaker and smaller and more portable than its Kilburn II speaker. Any way you look at it, it sounds very good for its size and puts out a surprising amount of quality bass while offering good treble detail and natural-sounding mids (where vocals live). I also liked that it has equalizer controls on the speaker itself and is fully waterproof and dustproof with an IP67 rating. Battery life is rated at up to 20 hours at moderate volume levels and Marshall says it takes 4.5 hours to fully recharge the speaker. Its USB-C charging port also has a charge-out feature that allows you to use the speaker as a power bank and charge your devices. You can pair two or more speakers to amplify the sound, but you can't pair two speakers together to create a stereo pair. Marshall says the Middleton uses True Stereophonic, ""a unique form of multidirectional stereo sound"" and I did think the soundstage was bigger than what you typically get from a speaker this size. The only downside to the speaker is that it's fairly expensive but I was otherwise impressed. Back in 2020, Tribit released the StormBox Micro, a budget version of Bose's excellent SoundLink Micro speaker that delivered surprisingly good sound for its size and modest price. The second-gen StormBox Micro 2 offers improved sound and battery life, along with a charge-out feature that turns the speaker into a power bank for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. An integrated strap allows you to clip it to your backpack or your bike's handlebars. Like the original, it's an excellent value and easy to recommend if you're looking for a super-compact portable wireless speaker. It does cost $60 but sometimes goes on sale for closer to $50. SCORE Anker's Soundcore Motion X600 mini boom box not only has a premium look and feel with a metal grille and carrying handle, but includes some interesting features like spatial audio and support for Sony's LDAC audio codec. It sounds impressive for its relatively compact size and is a good value. Weighing 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), it's got some heft to it, but it's light enough to carry around without feeling like you're getting a workout. The speaker is available in gray, green and blue color options and is equipped with five drivers, including two woofers, two tweeters and one full-range, upward-firing driver ""in a unique speaker array that combined with Soundcore's audio algorithm and DSP helps create a wide (and tall) soundstage for listening to any type of music,"" according to Anker. It's rated for 50 watts of total power, with two 20-watt amps devoted to the woofers and tweeters and a third 10-watt amp powering the upward-firing driver. At the default sound setting without bass boost or spatial audio engaged, I wasn't exactly wowed with sound quality (the bass is a bit underwhelming, the mids are recessed and there's a bit too much treble push). But as soon as you engage the bass boost and spatial audio, everything sounds more balanced and full. You can also tweak the sound profile further in the Soundcore companion app for iOS and Android. Sony's smallest Bluetooth speaker was once again modestly upgraded in 2023, with a new Bluetooth chipset, slightly improved sound and speakerphone performance. This portable Bluetooth speaker is both dust- and waterproof with an IP67 certification and, like its predecessor (the SRS-XB13), it's rated for 16 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and it charges via USB-C. Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with support for the AAC and SBC audio codecs, the speaker plays bigger than you'd think for its small size, with some punch to its bass. It's pretty impressive for a mini mono speaker. Although the 9.6-ounce (272-gram) speaker appears to have the same design as the XB13, Sony says its new sound diffusion processor ""realizes richer spread sound,"" which means this has a bit wider soundstage, which I can confirm. It can output only so much sound, but if you add a second XB100, you can get stereo-quality sound. There's no companion app, but that isn't a huge deal. The XB100 is available in multiple color options and includes a strap so you can attach it to various objects. It also has speakerphone capabilities with an integrated microphone. (As I said, the speakerphone's performance has been improved, and callers said they could hear me clearly indoors.) SCORE With each new version of the Flip, JBL makes small improvements, and while the latest model, the Flip 6, doesn't look much different from the Flip 5 on the outside, it does feature improved sound. It has two-way drivers with a woofer and tweeter and dual passive radiators that help the Flip 6 deliver much deeper bass than you think it could. It's fully waterproof and dustproof with an IPX67 rating. Like the Flip 5, it's rated for up to 12 hours of audio playback at moderate volume levels and charges via USB-C. Available in multiple color options, it's one of the best-sounding speakers for its compact size. SCORE I consider the smaller Boom 2 the best value among current Soundcore by Anker Bluetooth speakers because it delivers very strong sound for a speaker that costs a little more than $100. But the larger and more expensive Boom 2 Plus is a better-sounding speaker that plays louder and produces bigger sound with more bass. It costs around $250, the key thing about it is that it competes well with boom box speakers from JBL and Sony which cost upwards of $400. This speaker has dual 50W woofers and dual 20W tweeters, Anker says, and charges via USB-C, which is nice. There is also a charge-out option to charge your devices and the Boom 2 Plus is rated for up to 20 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels. The speaker has both a handle and removable strap to make it easy to carry around and is IPX7 waterproof. It also floats should you drop it in a body of water and has a customizable light show option. SCORE JBL's Charge 5 offers a good balance of size, performance and durability. It's bigger than some of the mini speakers on this list, like the Flip 5, but is still compact and packs more bass punch and overall volume. Featuring a built-in USB charging port for juicing up your mobile devices, it offers improved audio and a dustproof and waterproof design that's elevated from the previous Charge. According to JBL, the speaker is equipped with a ""racetrack-shaped driver,"" with a separate tweeter and dual passive radiators, to improve both clarity and bass performance over the Charge 4. (In my tests, this indeed proved to be the case.) Battery life is rated at 20 hours at moderate volume levels. This model is also equipped with JBL's PartyBoost feature that allows you to connect it to other compatible JBL portable speakers to augment their sound. The Charge 5 comes in six color options: black, blue, gray, red, teal and ""squad"" (which looks like a kind of camo). For its first three generations, JBL's Clip micro Bluetooth speaker had a circular design. For the fourth-gen Clip 4, JBL has moved to a more oval shape, bulked up the speaker slightly and added USB-C charging. This portable Bluetooth speaker does seem more durable, with a sturdier integrated carabiner clip. Also, it sounds a little better, with more volume, clearer sound and more bass. With an IP67 water-resistance rating, it can survive being dunked in shallow water and is dustproof. The Clip 4 is right up there with the best overall micro Bluetooth speakers. SCORE Ultimate Ears' fourth-generation Wonderboom 4 offers some small improvements over its predecessor, including USB-C charging (finally) and a new Podcast EQ mode. Otherwise, the speaker is unchanged and sounds very similar with an identical battery life rating of 14 hours (at moderate volume levels) and a Bluetooth chip that allows for extended wireless range of over 130 feet (40 meters). The design hasn't been altered either, although the speaker now comes in different color options. Like its predecessor, the Wonderboom 4 carries a list price of $100 but sometimes sells for a little less. Its IP67 rating means that it's not only waterproof but also dust-proof (and able to float). This model retains the Outdoor Boost mode that boosts treble and you can link two together (or pair up with a Wonderboom 3 or Wonderboom 2) to create a stereo pair by simply pressing a button on each speaker. Featuring very good sound for its small size, there's some decent punch to the bass (being short yet squat helps it produce more low end), but it can only deliver so much kick. SCORE Released in 2021, the PartyBox 110 packs some serious punch and delivers a bigger sound than many portable boombox speakers, including JBL's own Boombox 3. There's an integrated handle for toting the speaker, but the PartyBox 110 is pretty hefty, weighing in at 23 pounds and measuring slightly more than 22 inches tall. You can stand this Bluetooth boom box up vertically as shown in the picture above or place it horizontally, as it has rubber feet on both sides of the speaker. It's rated for up to 12 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels and has a redesigned light show that syncs to the beat of your music (you can customize the light show from the speaker itself or use the JBL PartyBox companion app). The speaker has Bluetooth or a wired USB connection and there are guitar and mic inputs. It's also worth noting that the speaker is IPX4 splash-proof and you can wirelessly link two PartyBox 110 speakers together for stereo sound. The fourth generation of JBL's smallest Bluetooth speaker not only has an upgraded design, but it delivers slightly better sound and significantly better battery life -- up to 7 hours versus the JBL Go 3's 5 hours at moderate volume levels. The speaker can only deliver so much sound for its tiny size (don't get your expectation up to high), but it sounds better than you think given just how small it is (it truly fits in a pocket) and manages to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Available in multiple color options, the speaker is also durable and has an IP67 water-resistance rating, which means it can survive being fully submerged in water and is also dust-proof. All in all, it's one of thetop micro Bluetooth speakersout there. SCORE Sonos Roam: Available in white or black for $179, the Roam is currently the smallest and most affordable Sonos speaker (if you don't count those $99 Sonos-compatible Symfonisk Ikea Wi-Fi bookshelf speakers), although it's fairly expensive for a mini wireless speaker. This Sonos Roam model, like the bigger Sonos Move 2 portable speaker, is equipped with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and can tap into an existing Sonos multiroom audio system and link with other Series 2-compatible Sonos speakers. Learn more about theSonos Roam with our hands-on review. Tribit XSound Go: Despite being on the market for several years, the Tribit XSound Go remains one of the top Bluetooth speakers for the money. Besides sounding decent for streaming your favorite music and more, this affordable Bluetooth speaker is also fully waterproof. It has had some small upgrades over the years. JBL Pulse 5: JBL's Pulse speaker is now in its fifth generation, and both the sound quality and 360-degree light show have been improved. JBL has ""expanded the transparent outer body"" so the customizable light show looks more impressive. (There's a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to alter the colorful lighting effects.) The speaker is also IP67 dustproof and waterproof, and it offers up to 12 hours of battery at moderate volume levels. Anker Motion Boom: Anker's more expensive Soundcore Motion Boom Plus (see above) is a substantial sound upgrade over the original Motion Boom but this model remains a very good mini boom box for the money. Equipped with a handle and weighing a little over 4 pounds, the speaker reminds me of one of those giant flashlights or ""floating lanterns"" that were in vogue about 30 years ago. For the record, the Motion Boom actually does float and is fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. UE Hyperboom: Ultimate Ears' Boom Bluetooth speakers come in a few different sizes, but none of them are as big as theHyperboom. A supersize wireless speaker that tips the scales at a hefty 13 pounds, the Hyperboom makes theUE Megaboom 3look unquestionably puny. It's not cheap, but its sound quality is better than a lot of the jumbo portable speakers on the market right now.Read our full review of the UE Hyperboom. Marshall Willen: Marshall's little mono Willen speaker is similar to Bose's SoundLink Micro and other micro speakers like the Tribit StormBox Micro 2. Also like those speakers, it has an integrated strap on its base so you can clip it onto a backpack or even to your bike's handlebars. Its 2-inch full-range driver and two passive radiators put out more sound than you'd think it would for its tiny size, and it offers decent clarity as well as just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny (you can choose from three preset sound modes). Tribit StormBox: The StormBox looks like a cross between a UE and a JBL speaker. We suspect that's not an accident. This fully waterproof speaker costs significantly less than the JBL Flip 5 and Flip 6 and produces a bigger sound. Its rechargeable battery offers up to 20 hours of battery life for playing music and more. Tribit's XSound speakers are probably a better value, but the StormBox is more stylish. Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen): A couple of years ago, Bang & Olufsen upgraded its dome-shaped aluminum-clad A1 speaker with improved battery life, better speakerphone performance (it now has a three-microphone array) and slightly improved sound. It's not only the smallest wireless speaker from the Danish company, it's technically the most affordable. Bose SoundLink Micro: Although a little pricey and due to be upgraded, the Bose SoundLink Micro sounds remarkably decent for its tiny size, delivering more bass than other pocketable speakers. It's a fully waterproof Bluetooth speaker and is available in three color options, although the blue version appears to be hard to find. Anker Soundcore Motion Plus: Anker's Soundcore Motion Plus came out in 2019, but it remains one of the best-sounding speakers for around $100. It's larger than many mini Bluetooth speakers, but it's still compact. It manages to sound quite a bit fuller than much of the competition in its price range, with bigger bass, more volume and better clarity. It's also fully waterproof (IPX7-rated) and has support for the aptX streaming codec for devices like Samsung's Galaxy phones that support it. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore: It's a little overpriced for the sound quality it delivers, but the Beosound Explore is a very good little speaker that has a sleek, eye-catching design, is fully waterproof and dustproof (IP67 rating), and offers excellent battery life, with up to 27 hours of music listening at moderate volume levels. Monoprice Soundstage 3: Monoprice tends to make pretty generic-looking electronic products, and its understated Soundstage 3 Bluetooth speaker probably isn't going to wow you with its design although its minimalist aesthetic has its appeal. It's a good value thanks to its ability to play big sound with strong bass and decent clarity, with 50 watts of power that drives a 5.25-inch ""concave aluminum cone woofer"" flanked by two 1-inch silk-dome tweeters. It also has good connectivity options, including digital optical, 3.5mm analog and RCA analog wired inputs that allow you to connect your television or another stereo component. There's also a sub-out port. Tribit XSound Mega: Over the last few years, Tribit has made several Bluetooth speakers that deliver a lot of boom for the buck. Add its new XSound Mega to the list. Tribit is billing the XSound Mega as more of an outdoor speaker — a lanyard is included for toting it around as a sort of mini boombox — but it works just fine indoors. It has an LED light show that you can turn on or off and there are three EQ settings for sound: XBass, Music and Audiobook. Additionally, it can be used as a power bank to charge your mobile devices. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker. Value-priced wireless speakers continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" Bluetooth speakers from Chinese brands like Tribit for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for a more premium speaker, you can expect to pay $100 or more, especially for larger portable speakers that deliver better sound. Bigger speakers tend to sound better, delivering a bigger sound with more bass. Going bigger means they weigh more, which can make them a little harder to carry around. So you have to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. If you're interested in a largerportable speaker,one feature worth looking out for is a built-in handle. Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, having a more durable speaker is a desirable trait. Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. Many speakers don't offer that feature, so choose accordingly if that's something you're looking for. If you're looking for more speakers that fit this bill, check outour roundup of the best speakerphones here. In assessing what the best Bluetooth speakers are, we consider the design of the speaker and how durable it seems, along with sound quality, battery life, extra features (such as additional connectivity options) and overall value. We test speakers in real-life environments both indoors and outdoors and compare it to other speakers in the same price range. The list includes everything fromcompact mini modelsand pocket-size micro versions to heftier models with powerful audio. For more, check out our lists of thebest smart speakers,best PC speakersand thebest Wi-Fi speakers and music systems. When choosing a Bluetooth speaker, it comes down to size and price. If you're looking for a very portable speaker, you'll want to get something very compact, but remember that smaller speakers usually produce less sound and bass than larger ones. There are plenty of mini Bluetooth speakers that deliver a bigger sound than you might expect, but they do have their sonic limitations. For a lot of people, it's a question of finding a speaker that's not too big or too small -- one that travels well but also is capable of producing good sound for its size. Finding the best portable Bluetooth speaker also comes down to your budget. Price can be a limiting factor. You may not want to spend $150 or more for a small speaker. Luckily, there are plenty of good options for $100, and some decent mini Bluetooth speakers can cost less than $50. Also, certain ""value"" brands that sell primarily on Amazon are strongly worth considering because they do offer a lot for the money. If you're looking for the best sound quality, as I said, bigger is usually better, and some larger portable Bluetooth speakers -- sometimes referred to as Bluetooth boom boxes -- can put out a lot of sound and have an integrated handle for toting them around. Well, first of all, you need a TV, video streaming device or set-top cable or satellite box that has Bluetooth. You connect a Bluetooth speaker just like you do Bluetooth earbuds: through the Bluetooth settings menu on your TV or those aforementioned devices (Apple TV, for instance, has Bluetooth connectivity, making it easy to connect your AirPods). The only issue with connecting a Bluetooth speaker to your TV is that there can be some audio-video syncing issues due to Bluetooth lag. In some cases, where your Bluetooth speaker has an audio input (a few high-end Bluetooth speakers even have digital audio inputs), you can use a wired connection to the speaker via the audio outputs on your TV. Soundbars tend to use the optical or HDMI connection on your TV to get sound. Many soundbars have a Bluetooth option so you can wirelessly stream music from your phone to the soundbar. So if you're looking to really build out the sound on your television, you may want to look into building atrue home theater systemor agreat soundbaraudio experience. The loudest Bluetooth speakers are the biggest ones. Sometimes they're referred to as boom boxes or ""party"" speakers. Some of those speakers are portable and have built-in rechargeable batteries while the biggest party speakers have wheels on them for transport and need to be plugged in with an AC adapter because they require so much power. We have alist of the best wireless boom box speakersif you're looking for a bigger Bluetooth speaker. It's also worth noting that Bluetooth speakers from the same company can be daisy-chained together to augment their sound or paired together as a left-right stereo pair. Often, the best way to get a bigger sound is to pair two Bluetooth speakers together in a stereo pair. ","With so many good Bluetooth speakers on the market, finding the best one can be tricky.

386,Google's Whisk AI Image Generator Lets You Remix From Quick Picks,"Google has unveiled a playful new AI image generation platform, called Whisk, that lets you prompt it with pictures rather than wordy text prompts. WithWhisk, announced this week, you drag in images to give the tool a sense of what you're looking for. It asks you to upload a picture of any subject (such as a person or animal), a scene (like a beach, jungle or cityscape) and then an image that reflects the desired style (such as retro, emo or anime). From there, it lets you ""remix"" the elements to create unique images in the form of stickers, enamel pins or digital plush toys. Users can further tweak the final creations, which may evolve during the generation process, by adjusting prompts — for instance, asking the tool to change the subject's height, hairstyle or skin tone. An experimental tool from Google Labs, Whisk runs on the company's Gemini AI model, which automatically writes a detailed caption for the input images. These descriptions are then fed into Google's newest image-generation model,Imagen 3, to produce a new picture. See also:Best AI Image Generators of 2024 Two years on from OpenAI's blockbuster debut of ChatGPT, tech companies are continuing to explore what generative AI is capable of and to roll out new capabilities. This month alone, that's included OpenAI'sSora video generation tooland newApple Intelligence featuresin iOS 18.2, such as Genmoji, Visual Intelligence and ChatGPT integrations with Siri. Google, meanwhile, hasintroduced Gemini 2.0and a limited release of its Project Astra vision-assisted AI agent. In its blog post, Google described Whisk as more of a creative tool than a traditional image editor. ""We built it for rapid visual exploration, not pixel-perfect edits,"" the blog post said. ""It's about exploring ideas in new and creative ways, allowing you to work through dozens of options and download the ones you love.""","You can transform existing photos into mashups in the form of stickers, pins or plush toys.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/googles-whisk-ai-image-generator-lets-you-remix-from-quick-picks/,
387,"I Tried to Design a Holiday Card With AI, but It Kept Giving Me a Fake Family","The holidays are almost upon us, and you probably won't have time to catch up with everyone you'd like to see before the new year. So how can you show your extended family and friends that you're thinking of them? Send a card. You know the type. The Hallmark-esque holiday card, with a cute family photo and a ""Happy Holidays"" message. A little cheesy? Maybe. But we all secretly love it. Withartificial intelligence, you can create a custom card in minutes, just like you can do withwedding invitesor adinner party menu. CouldMidjourneycapture the Christmas magic? If the text-to-image tool can create realistic product images, food photography, comic books and magazine front covers, surely it can mockup a Christmas card. The tool came out in 2022, and the membership prices range from $10 to $120 per month. If you subscribe to the yearly membership, you get 20% off these rates. Midjourney no longer offers a free version. Before jumping into Midjourney, I had a few family photos ready to go that I liked. Some photo cards are a compilation of images from the year, while others are just a single shot. It's worth Googling family holiday cards for design inspiration to get a feel for styles and keywords for your prompt. For example, words like retro, traditional, themed or minimal work well. I opted for a single image, just because I have so many photos from the year that it's hard to narrow down my top few. Once I had my photo, I chose a Midjourney membership. The basic plan is fine, which set me back $10. As with all AI tools, it helps to be as specific as possible with prompts. Give it as much context upfront. If you're planning to print and send it like a postcard, specify that. To upload a photo with your prompt, type/imagine, then drag your photo into the prompt box. Click on the icon in the ""what will you imagine?"" box to use that image. Here was my prompt: ""Use this image to create a Christmas card printable postcard with a happy holidays message."" It missed the mark entirely, fabricating a snowy setting in Big Sur, California. For prompt two, I asked Midjourney to place the photo (unchanged)ona festive Christmas card… and it got worse. I like cats and all, but I love my wife more. Next, I tried a different approach. I asked Midjourney to generate Christmas card templates. I found a simple template I liked, then asked Midjourney to add my photo onto it. Again, super weird. I tried various workarounds, such as asking Midjourney to create a Christmas card that I can add a photo to, but it just kept generating fake families. Midjourney turned cheesy into cringe. I was on the website version of Midjourney, so to give it one more go, I tried the Discord route but didn't have much luck either. I couldn't get my photo into the prompt, even though I'd given Discord full access to my photo library. So I opened the Discord desktop and was able to link my photo. It didn't help at all. I had a quick look on Reddit and it seems I'm not alone. Midjourney is known to change the faces of images you upload. One comment said to rerun until you get an image you like, then use Photoshop to swap faces. Someone replied saying they had to rerun 50 times to get a good one. That's a Christmas mood crusher. For the sake of this experiment (and because I was now set on sending a Christmas card), I went toVistaPrintto see how fast I could create a card. I'd received a couple in the mail from friends that were adorable. With VistaPrint, I made this in under a minute. It's just missing my Christmas note. While Midjourney did produce a few cute images, I couldn't get it to create a design that incorporated my photo directly -- instead, it altered the image or used it as ""inspiration."" It kept adding Christmas elements to my original photo, like switching out my wife with a reindeer or a cat. Midjourney might have merit creating Christmas cartoons, DIY advent calendars or generic printable cards to hole punch and string onto presents. But like I found when I tried to create apersonalized cartoon for my nephews, AI has a hard time nailing personal features and consistency. It still feels very cartoony and very obviously AI. I'd much rather send a handwritten note to a few of my favorites than rely on a robot to deliver Christmas wishes.",There's still time to be the cute couple who sends a holiday card.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-to-design-a-holiday-card-with-ai-but-it-kept-giving-me-a-fake-family/,
388,Best 85-Inch TV for 2024,"A big TV is a big investment and at CNET, our general advice for TV shoppers is that bigger is usually better, especially if you want to maximize 4K content. To help you find the right big-screen TV -- whether it's this year's model or, in some cases, last year's -- we've rounded up some of the best 85-inch TVs on the market right now. The list below represents the best TVs we've reviewed in CNET's test lab, where we've compared them side by side. We've reviewed the 65-inch sizes in the series for most of the models listed below, but the 83- and 85-inch versions are virtually identical, beyond screen size. After testing a handful of the best TVs for the money, we've found that theTCL QM8 (2024) seriestops the list for several reasons. The latest QM8 offers superb picture quality overall, all the features you need in a modern television -- including4K/120Hz input and variable refresh ratethat can get the most out of consoles like thePS5andXbox Series X-- and an affordable price. When a friend asks us what 85-inch TV to buy, we tell them the TCL QM8 series. That said, the Hisense U8N is currently discounted to $600 less than the TCL and offers a picture that is almost as good. There are plenty of other excellent choices available. Although this year's QM8 is our favorite for most people, it might not be right for your preferences or budget. For every price point, keep in mind that the holiday shopping season brings about majorCyber Monday TV dealsand discounts you may want to take advantage of. TCL continues to lead the 85-inch TV pack with its new 2024 QM8. In our comparison tests it stood out with superior brightness and better contrast than other 85-inch TVs at this price, thanks to itsmini-LED technologyand well-implementedfull-array local dimming. The TV has a modern, sleek design with a center-mount stand. The QM8 uses Google TV as its operating system, which we don't like as much as Roku TV, but it's still a solid smart TV. This model replaces theTCL QM8from last year. If you're looking for the best value 85-inch TV and find the TCL QM8 just a bit too expensive, consider the Hisense U8N your go-to. In our side-by-side comparison of the two 2024 models, the QM8 came out just ahead, but the U8N still impressed us with its great performance. Both TVs boast outstanding image quality featuring mini-LED backlights and full-array local dimming. They also share similar gaming features and run on the Google TV operating system. Both models are considerably cheaper than other TVs with comparable image quality from more established brands. OLED TVs have the best picture quality, but they don't come in 85-inch sizes, so that's why we're listing this 83-inch size instead. The C4 represents better picture quality thanany non-OLED TVon this list at a price that's higher but still not stratospheric. It excels with perfect black levels, unmatched contrast and excellent off-angle viewing, standing out against the mini-LED models in my comparison tests. While it may not be as bright as some other models, it still performs exceptionally well in all kinds of room lighting. The C4 is also one of the lightest TVs we've ever reviewed thanks to carbon-fiber construction. If you're in the market for a top-notch 85-inch TV but prefer not to go with OLED, the Samsung QN90B is an excellent choice. This TV features QLED TV technology with mini-LEDs for a brighter image than any OLED TV. Although OLED TVs still won the contrast battle in our side-by-side tests, the QN90B QLED screen is closer than ever to matching it. Among Samsung's lineup of its many QLED TVs, the QN90B stands out as a premium model, second only to their versions with8K resolution. It's a 2022 model, and while the 2024 versionQN90Dlooks very similar in terms of features, we expect it to deliver similar image quality, though we have yet to review it. Our TV reviews follow a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process honed over nearly two decades of television reviews. Our primary TV test lab has specialized equipment for measuring light and color, including aKonica Minolta CS-2000spectroradiometer, aMurideo Sig-G4K HDR signal generator and anAVPro Connect 8x84K HDR distribution matrix. We usePortrait Displays CalMan Ultimatesoftware to evaluate every television we review. In every CNET TV review, three or more similar TVs are compared side by side in various lighting conditions, playing different media, including movies, TV shows and games, and across a variety of test categories, from color to video processing to gaming to HDR. Our reviews also account for design, features, smart TV performance, HDMI input and gaming compatibility among other factors. One important aspect of image quality we test is overall brightness. Here's how it compares innitsacross select TVs listed above.  Check outHow We Test TVsfor more details. With all the TVs available today, and all the technical terms and jargon associated with television technology, it can be tough to figure out what's important. Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion. Price:TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive, and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Most entry-level TVs have a good enough picture for most people, but TVs last a long time, so it might be worth spending more to get a better picture. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower. Screen size:Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV, and 65 inches or larger is best. More than any other ""feature,"" stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money. One of the most common post-TV-purchase complaints we've heard is from people who didn't go big enough. We rarely hear people complain that their TV is too large. Capability:When it comes to entry-level TVs, the most important feature is what kind of smart TV system the TV uses. Among midrange models, look for a feature including full-array local dimming, mini-LED and 120Hz refresh rate, which (unlike some other extras) do help improve the picture, in our experience. Among high-end TVs, OLED technology is your best bet. For more TV buying advice, check outHow to Buy a TV. It depends on your room size, seating distance and personal taste. For a large living room or den, an 85-inch TV is generally excellent, but it's too big for smaller living rooms or most bedrooms. If you sit closer to the screen you don't need as large a TV for the best experience. For maximum theatrical impact,according to THX and SMPTE, you should be between 13 and 15 feet from an 85-inch screen, although many viewers will find it more comfortable to sit a bit further back than that. Every 85-inch TV has 4K resolution, and if you have 20/20 vision you can sit as close as about 4.5 feet from the screen and still not discern individual pixels. Most 85-inch TVsmeasure around 74 inches wide. Because the frames around newer TV screens are typically quite narrow, 85-inch TV widths don't vary much. Models with very slim frames are on the lower end; the 85-inch Samsung QN90A measures 74.5 inches wide for example, while the slightly thicker-framed 85-inch TCL 4-Series is 74.9 inches wide. If you're not planning to wall-mount the TV, you generally want the piece of furniture supporting the TV to measure at least as wide as the TV itself, and preferably a few inches wider. Refer to the manufacturer's website for the exact dimensions of a particular 83-inch or 85-inch TV. An 85-inch TV weighs between 90 and 120 pounds with its stand, but this varies significantly depending on the type of TV. The carbon-fiber LG C4 83-inch TV weighs 92 pounds with the stand, for example, while the 85-inch Samsung QN90C weighs 110 pounds with the stand. Removing the stand allows you to wall-mount the TV and reduces its weight (stands can weigh up to 20 pounds). Shipping weight (box, accessories, etc.) adds another 10 to 20 pounds. Refer to the manufacturer's website for the exact weights of a particular 85-inch TV.",These are the best 85-inch TVs you can get in 2024.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-85-inch-tv/,
389,"Best Cellphone Plans of 2024: Our Top Picks for Black Friday, December and the Holidays","Choosing the best phone plans from big players like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon – not to mention several options from prepaid and smaller carriers like Boost Mobile and Mint Mobile– can be daunting. With so many choices, it’s easy to overpay if you’re not careful. Luckily, we’re here to guide you. After more than a decade of wireless plan reviews, we understand how to sort through madness. We’ve selected our top picks for what we think are the best unlimited and prepaid plans available right now. T-Mobile reshuffled its plans last year and got rid of our previous pick in this spot, the Base Essentials plan that offered a single line for $45 a month. It replaced that option with an Essentials Savings plan, a ""limited time"" offer of $50 a month for a single line. It has since been renamed to Essentials Saver, and although the plan is largely the same, there are some notable tweaks. The data remains unlimited, and you now get 50GB of high-speed data, instead of the 20GB that Base Essentials offers. T-Mobile hasn't said how long the Essentials Saver option will hang around, but we break downhow it compares to the carrier's plans here. As before, perks like free Netflix or the bundling of taxes and fees into the sticker price aren't included. You do get unlimited hotspots at ""3G speeds"" and unlimited talk, text and 2G data in Mexico and Canada. At $50 for a single line, the Essentials Saver plan is now the same price for a single line as AT&T's Value Plus plan, and both could be solid options for those looking for a single line without frills. Although the price of the AT&T and T-Mobile plans are now the same, we give T-Mobile the edge here mainly because it includes hotspot access. Even at ""3G speeds,"" the option could be a useful feature in a pinch. It's also worth mentioning that T-Mobile allows for multiple lines on this plan, with two lines running for $80 a month. (If you need three or more, you may want to look at one of T-Mobile's other plans, which could be cheaper thanks to various promotions the carrier regularly runs.) You may need to click ""see more plans"" and then ""explore Essentials Saver plan"" on T-Mobile's site to get this option to appear, although lately, the carrier has been showing it alongside its other offerings. This is a bit more complicated. Verizon used to be our pick with its Play More plan that bundled in the Disney Bundle (ad-free Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu with ads) and services like Google Play Pass or Apple Arcade into the plan's sticker price. Now the carrier has updated its wireless plans to remove perks like the Disney Bundle or Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass from being automatically included with its service. Even with its new plans, it's still our pick for best perks, but this will require a bit more explanation. Instead of automatically putting services in, it now offers a variety of perks at $10 per month per perk, allowing users to pick and choose what they want. It also now allows its lower-cost plan, known as Unlimited Welcome, to participate. Unlimited Welcome runs $65 per month for one line or $120 per month for four lines. You get unlimited talk, text and data but you don't get access to Verizon's fastest 5G networks (what it calls ""5G Ultra Wideband"") or hotspot data. For that, you will need to step up to its pricier Unlimited Plus plan ($80 for one line, $180 for four lines). Both the Welcome and Plus plans include the ability to add perks at that $10 per month rate. This includes the Disney Bundle (normally $15 per month), Apple One individual (normally around $17 per month), Apple Music Family (which can be shared with five people and normally runs $17 per month) and Walmart Plus (normally $13 per month but also includes Paramount Plus Essential). There are also other perks including an additional 100GB of hotspot data (normally $45 per month), 2TB of Verizon's cloud storage (normally $15 per month), three days of international data (what the carrier calls TravelPass, normally $10 per day). All perks can be turned on or off at will, and you could forgo them entirely. You can even go with multiple perks on a single line if you want. Whether this makes sense for your situation may require some time with a spreadsheet going through what services work for you and what you're willing to pay for them. The savings could add up if you're paying for some of these services directly, but it also could be more expensive than your existing plan. It is also worth mentioning that Verizon allows you to ""mix and match"" lines, so if not everyone needs the faster 5G connectivity they could be on Unlimited Welcome while the one who does can go on Unlimited Plus. AT&T allows something similar with its unlimited plans, but at the moment, it no longer offers any streaming perks. To get T-Mobile's perks everyone has to be on the same plan. If you wanted a cheaper way to save on one or two services like the Disney Bundle, you could have four lines for $120 per month, add the Disney perk for $10 and be paying $130 per month for the whole package. Oh, and you can also combine these plans with Verizon's other discounts for teachers, nurses, military and first responders to save a bit more. US Mobile, which runs on Verizon's network for its Warp 5G service, AT&T's for its Dark Star option and T-Mobile's for its GSM or Light Speed offering, has recently updated its plans again. Now its cheapest Unlimited Flex option starts at $17.50 per line, per month when purchased annually ($210 total). That's significantly cheaper than its Unlimited Starter and Visible's offer, but it comes with some caveats. Taxes and fees are still included in the sticker price, but you'll now get 10GB of high-speed data and 5GB of hotspot data (unless you want to add it for $30 for the year). You'll need to step up to the carrier's pricier Unlimited Starter or Premium plans to add more high-speed data, international roaming or streaming perks. If you don't want to prepay for a year, you can get Unlimited Starter for $25 monthly. It is worth noting that if you want to switch networks, you get two free switches but then it will cost you $2 each time you ""teleport.""Other options: Verizon's Visible has long been competitive in the prepaid space. At $25 per month, it's not a bad alternative if you want Verizon's network. Opting for the annual payment option would put it at $275 for the year. Through Dec. 2 it is offering $5 off the monthly price of its base plan (making it $20 per month instead of its usual $25) for 24 months so long as you use promo code ""SAVE24"" at checkout. The base plan includes unlimited talk, text and data on Verizon 5G and 4G LTE networks but you won't be able to take advantage of Verizon's fastest networks. Unlimited hotspot is also included, though it's capped at speeds of 5Mbps. Those who want faster data speeds for their regular data and hotspot connections, plus unlimited talk, text and 2GB of data every day in Canada and Mexico need to look at Visible's pricier Visible Plus plan that normally runs $45 per month (or $35 per month with this promotion). All that said, if you don't need Verizon's fastest possible speeds, don't want to outlay a full year's service in one shot and want to be on Verizon's network, it's hard to beat this price. Taxes and fees are also included in this price. Google's phone service has adjusted its pricing, making it a bit less appealing compared with major providers. For a family of four, you can now get its Simply Unlimited plan for $100 per month ($25 per month, per line), which includes not only unlimited talk, text and 35GB of high-speed data but also 5GB of mobile hotspot use. There also is free roaming in Canada and Mexico, although taxes and fees aren't included in the sticker price. This used to be $80 per month ($20 per month, per line), butGoogle has raised its pricing. Google Fi Wirelessruns largely on T-Mobile's network and its service includes 5G access. Other options: Cricket has a similar unlimited plan with four lines for $100 per month, but it lacks hotspot data. Metro has $100 for four line options as well, but you need to go through thecarrier's Heritage sectionand then call customer service to be able to sign up. When it comes to data under 15GB, Mint once again has the best value if T-Mobile's network is solid in your area. Getting 15GB of 4G LTE/5G monthly data is $20 per month at Mint if you're a new subscriber and buy in 12-month increments. After that, you can buy three more months at $35 per month ($105 total), six months at $25 per month ($150 total) or another year at $20 per month ($240 total).Other options:Google Fi has a ""bill protection"" feature designed to refund you for data you don't use, but with a maximum monthly charge of $80 per month for one line and 6GB of data and unlimited talk and text, I think you're better off looking elsewhere instead of having to calculate how much data you're using. AT&T has an online offer of 16GB per month if you prepay the $300 for a full year (equating to $25 per month). If you use up the 16GB, you will still get unlimited data, but it will slow speeds down to 1.5Mbps until your month resets. Tracfone's 10GB plan generally runs $40 per month, though you can prepay for a year for $384 (which breaks down to $32 monthly). The perk with the AT&T and Tracfone plans is that any unused data carries over to the next month. For the latter, if you're looking for a prepaid provider on Verizon that could be your pick. If you're looking for service for a backup phone that's rarely used, TextNow has a free plan. Running on T-Mobile's network, the service offersfree unlimited talk and unlimited texting, although ads are placed in its app that you use to call and text people. There isn't any data included with this option, and removing the ads without adding data would run you $10 a month. If you want to watch YouTube, FaceTime or surf the web, you'll need to connect to Wi-Fi. Text messages are also done through the company's TextNow app, not through iMessage or WhatsApp, which makes sense as those services require data. If you need data, things get expensive quickly. An unlimited data hour pass runs $1 per hour, a day pass is $5 and a month pass is $40. If you need data, you're better off going with a different provider than TextNow.Other options: If you are largely on Wi-Fi and don't use much data then US Mobile's Light Plan is the go-to pick for low-cost but still with some data service. Buried under its other plans, the Light Plan includes unlimited talk and text as well as 2GB of data. This is better than our previous pick, Boost Mobile's new customer offer which gave you 1GB of data per month for a full year for $100. At $96 for the year, this is cheaper than what Boost's offer was and includes taxes and fees in that sticker price. If you don't want to pay annually, it's $10 per month. As we covered in our other wireless guides, to get the best deal you need to make sure you have the coverage that you need. This makes it hard to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon is more reliable. Your mileage may vary, but the good news is that these networks are growing and improving all the time, particularly as the three major players race to blanket the US with 5G. It's quite possible that you left a network complaining about its sparse service a decade ago, but now it's beefed itself up because of that race to acquire customers. If you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such asT-Mobile's Network Pass. Verizonoffers a similar 30-day ""Test Drive"" program,whileAT&T has recently introduced its own 30-day eSIM free trial optionfor sampling its network. Picking a wireless plan and carrier is a very individualized process. What works for you and your family's needs may be vastly different from your friends or neighbors. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work best on Verizon or T-Mobile (and vice versa). The picks we make are based on over a decade of covering and evaluating wireless carriers, their offerings and overall performance. In particular, we take into account the following:1. Coverage2. Price3. Value4. Perks Since all three major providers blanket most of the country with good 4G LTE or 5G, this is largely a toss-up on a macro level and why we recommend a variety of eSIM options for figuring out what works best for you in your particular location so you can best decide what is right for you. Looking at coverage maps on each provider's website will likely show whether you can get good coverage even if your experience isn't full bars or the fastest speeds.This is also why with prepaid plans, we specify which network each prepaid provider uses as they sometimes make that a bit difficult to figure out. Value is factoring in the total experience you might get, such as how much high-speed data you get and what's included in the sticker price. Perks are add-ons beyond the core components of wireless service (talk, text and data). This could range from bundling in or discounting streaming services to extra hotspot data or the ability to use your phone internationally. When choosing a phone plan, there are generally two main options: a postpaid carrier like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile (plus cable options like Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile) and prepaid providers such as Mint Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Google Fi Wireless and Cricket. The difference boils down to this: With postpaid, you're paying for your plan after you've used your service, while prepaid lets you buy that allotment in advance. Prepaid providers are generally cheaper than postpaid options, though they are also often (but not always) more limited when it comes to additional streaming perks, hotspot data or device discounts. To get a several hundred dollar trade-in credit toward a new iPhone, Pixel or Galaxy, you often will need to commit to a postpaid plan from one of the big three carriers and be willing to stay with that provider for 24 to 36 months. All three of the major wireless carriers also offer various discounts on the plan pricing depending on age, employment, military or veteran status or if you or someone on your family plan is a nurse, teacher or first responder. You can find details here forAT&T,T-MobileandVerizon. Look at a zoomed-out map of the US on the websites for AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon and you'll likely see it pretty well colored in by their respective color. Zooming in is where things get a bit more complicated, which is why we can't offer blanket recommendations for one carrier over another. T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in a rural area in Colorado, Verizon could be more reliable. All three offer 5G and ever-increasing coverage and data speeds as they all ramp up deployments of the latest wireless flavor. It's quite possible that, a decade ago, you left a network complaining about its weak service, but now it's beefed itself up because of that race to acquire customers. This is also why we recommend talking to friends, family or colleagues who have a different provider where you live, as locally your mileage may vary. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if it offers any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such asT-Mobile's Network Pass. Verizonnow offers a similar 30-day program, while the Cricket prepaid servicehas rolled out its own trial programthat lets you sample parent AT&T's network. Smaller carriers often use the networks of larger providers. This includes the prepaid options owned by the big carriers (AT&T owns Cricket, Verizon owns Tracfone, T-Mobile owns Metro) as well as smaller options like Mint Mobile (which runs on T-Mobile), Google Fi Wireless (which largely runs on T-Mobile) and Boost Mobile (which runs on AT&T, T-Mobile and parent company Dish's 5G networks). Weexplain this all in more detail here. If you're on T-Mobile, all of your plans are unlimited, and Verizon no longer lets new users sign up for a shared data plan. Only AT&T still offers some tiered data plans and unfortunately, it's not great. It has a 4GB-per-line plan that runs $50 a month for one line ($160 for four lines). Each line here gets 4GB of data, but if you go over that threshold in a month you're paying $10 for every 2GB. AT&T's plan also does not include access to its 5G networks. Although everyone's wireless needs are different, for most we think unlimited plans make the most sense, especially when it comes to choosing a new plan. AT&T's basic unlimited plan, called Unlimited Starter, is $65 a month for one line or $140 for four lines. If you have one or two lines and don't use a lot of data, you may be fine with one of these plans, though if you have just one line we'd recommend switching over to AT&T's $50-per-month Value Plus option or T-Mobile's Essentials Saver. Two lines of that T-Mobile plan run $80 a month, which is $10 cheaper than two lines of AT&T's 4GB plan and comes without the worry of navigating how much data you use.",Looking for a new phone plan this holiday season?

390,"Best TV of 2024, Tested by CNET Experts","What to consider Price TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Screen size Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. Capability Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality. If you're looking to buy a new TV, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of choices available. That's why we're here: to help you narrow down the choices, and choose the best TV for your space and budget. We test for gaming features such as 4K/120Hz as well as streaming movies on the best smart TV platforms. We’ve looked at all the top brands including Samsung, Roku, LG, Hisense, Vizio and TCL side-by-side in our CNET lab. Fromcheap 4K televisionstoQLED and high end OLEDTVs, and everything in between, these are the top TVs we've reviewed in 2024. Read more:How We Test TVs What to consider Price TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Screen size Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. Capability Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality. Given the multitude of options, the latestTCL QM8 serieshas replaced the2023 modelat the top of our best TV list for a number of reasons. The TCL QM851 offers a number of upgrades on the previous year, including a better backlight, superb picture quality overall and an affordable price tag. When a friend asks me what TV to buy from 65 to 98 inches, I tell them the TCL QM8 series. Although the QM8 is my current favorite, it may not be right for your preferences or budget. If you're wanting the best TV for the least amount of money then theSamsung DU7200 seriesis the best we've tested. Also check out thebest TVs for the holidaysfor more options. TCL has topped our list of the best TVs for the last few years and the QM8 is even better than before. In my comparison tests, it continues to stand out with superior brightness and impact while still maintaining excellent contrast: a combination no other TV could match at this price. The key ismini-LED techand well-implementedfull-array local dimming. It also has a sleek design with a center-mount stand. The operating system is Google TV, which I don't like as much as Roku TV, but it's still a solid smart TV. The main downside of the TCL QM8 is that it's available only in large sizes (65 inches and up). If you're looking for a 55-inch TV, I recommend the Hisense U8N instead. Note that prices shown here are for the 65-inch size in the QM8 series. Whether you’re looking for a budget option for your dorm room or a giant OLED display for the family living room, Walmart has great deals on top TVs in every size and budget. It’s not just during the holidays: Walmart has low prices all season long. Order online or reserve to pick up at your local store and get your new TV for less today. If CNET had a best bang-for-buck award one of the first winners would be the Samsung DU7200, a TV which delivers a really good picture for an affordable price. The black levels and shadow detail are excellent for the money, and while our test unit looked a little desaturated out of the box that's easily fixed by adjusting the Color control. It has onboard streaming and the sound quality isn't too bad either. If you're looking for a bedroom unit or a gaming TV then the Samsung DU7200 is the model we would choose. If you're looking for the best TV for the money and the TCL QM8 is just too big, the Hisense U8N should be your go-to. I compared the two TVs side by side, and while I liked the picture quality of the QM8 better, the U8N has one medium-size advantage: a 55-inch screen option. If 65 is too large for your room, your budget or your tastes, the choice between the two is simple: Get the 55-inch Hisense U8N. Both offer excellent image quality and affordable prices thanks to mini-LED backlights and full-array local dimming, as well as similar gaming features and the Google TV operating system. Both cost hundreds less than you'd have to pay to get similar image quality from a better-known brand. Note that while I tested the 65-inch size in the U8N series, the prices shown here are for the 55-inch size. The C4 has better picture quality thanany non-OLED TVon this list at a higher price, and it's still not outrageously expensive. Its perfect black levels, unbeatable contrast and superb off-angle viewing kept it a notch above the mini-LED models in my comparison tests, and while its overall brightness isn't quite as impressive, it's still an incredible performer in all kinds of room lighting. The C4 replaced the C3, and while we'll almost always recommendbuying last year's version of a TV, the C4 is available for around the same price and so is the model to go for. The prices shown here are for the 65-inch size of the LG C4 series. The Samsung S95D's matte finish does more than reduce reflections, it nearly eliminates them, improving image quality in bright rooms more than any OLED TV we've tested. Some non-OLED models have matte screens, but this is the first time they've been available in an OLED TV, a display technology that has always delivered thebest picture available. That matte finish really works, reducing windows and other glare to dimmer blobs instead of super-bright, mirror-like distractions. The S95D also has an external box, allowing for a cleaner look with the option to store HDMI connections and the power cord out of sight. Between its versatile matte screen and awesome picture overall, the Samsung S95D delivers the best image quality of any TV we've tested, beating both the G4 and last year's winner, theG3, as well as any other non-OLED TV. But it also costs a ton, and most people -- even those with bright rooms -- will be perfectly happy with aless expensive TV. In our tests over the years, Vizio TVs have produced very good picture quality without breaking the bank. The Vizio Quantum Pro continues this trend: it's a solid midpriced TV option, though not without a few notable drawbacks. In side-by-side comparison tests in our lab, the Quantum Pro performed well for the money, with better contrast than the similarly pricedRoku Plus Series, for example. On the other hand, as expected, slightly more expensive models like theTCL QM8andHisense U8Kwere better, with brighter images and higher contrast. One major drawback is the Quantum Pro's lack of size offerings; it comes only in65-or75-inchsizes. We reviewed the 65-inch model, but the review also applies to the 75-inch version since the specs and picture quality should be similar regardless of size. If you're looking for a smaller TV in this price range, you might instead turn to the Roku Plus Series, which offers a 55-inch model and a superior smart TV system. Vizio will also continue to offer this TV's predecessor, theM-Series Quantum X, in the 50-inch size. Competition among TVs in the middle pricing band is heating up, and the Plus Series is the latest entrant. Unlike the TCL Roku TVs higher on this list, this one is all Roku, with no other brands on board. It adds a couple of step-up extras, including QLED and full-array local dimming, which help deliver a better picture than the TCL 4-Series, for example. This is the first TV Roku has produced under its own brand, as opposed to partnering with a brand like TCL, Sharp, Pioneer or Hisense. The company also released a version with fewer features and no local dimming, called theRoku Select Series. The price shown below is for the 65-inch size. With all of the TVs available today, and all of the technical terms and jargon associated with television technology, it can be tough to figure out what's important. Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion. Screen size:Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. More so than any ""feature,"" stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money. One of the most common post-TV-purchase complaints we've heard is from people who didn't go big enough. And we rarely hear people complain that their TV is too large. Price:TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Most entry-level TVs have a good enough picture for most people, but TVs last a long time, so it might be worth spending more to get a better picture. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower. Capability:Among entry-level TVs the most important feature is what kind of smart TV system the TV uses. Among midrange models, look for a feature including full-array local dimming, mini-LED and 120Hz refresh rate, which (unlike some other extras) do help improve the picture in our experience. Among high-end TVs, OLED technology is your best bet. Our TV reviews follow a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process honed over nearly two decades of TV reviews. Our primary TV test lab has specialized equipment for measuring light and color, including aKonica Minolta CS-2000spectroradiometer, aMurideo Sig-G4K HDR signal generator and anAVPro Connect 8x84K HDR distribution matrix. We usePortrait Displays CalMan Ultimatesoftware to evaluate every TV we review. In every CNET TV review, three or more similar TVs are compared side by side in various lighting conditions playing different media, including movies, TV shows and games, across a variety of test categories, from color to video processing to gaming to HDR. Our reviews also account for design, features, smart TV performance, HDMI input and gaming compatibility, among other factors. LG C3: When we reviewed the C3 in 2023 it was one of our favorite TVs, and this impression continued into the following year. It's still a great TV, but with the pricing on this and the C4 being identical right now it makes sense to go for the newer TV. Samsung S90D: The S90D performed well, but it suffered some contrast loss compared to the C4. Any differences between the C4 and S90D were subtle. One important aspect of image quality we test is overall brightness. Here's how brightness compares innitsacross select TVs listed above. Check outHow We Test TVsfor more details.

If you have any others, feel free to reach out on Twitter (@dkatzmaier), or by clicking the little envelope icon onmy CNET profile page. Doing so will let you send a message straight to my inbox. Prices vary widely by size and features, from less than $100 for basic 24-inch TVs to more than $2,000 for big OLED models. TVs last a long time, so we think it's worthwhile to spend a little extra beyond the bare minimum to get a bigger screen, better picture quality or better features. With that in mind, here are some ballpark prices that will get you a very good TV in 2024. You could pay (much) more or less. The fact is just about any TV will produce a picture decent enough to satisfy most viewers. Most complaints you read in user reviews aren't about picture quality. Instead, they're about ease of use, smart TV menus or sound (or a broken TV). In our opinion bigger is better, and your money is best spent on large screen sizes rather than a slight upgrade in image quality. Theanswer also depends on room size and seating distance: If you have a big room and sit farther away, you'll want a bigger TV. In our reviews, OLED TVs, which use organic light-emitting diode technology, have always had better picture quality than LED TVs, which are essentially LCD TVs that use LED backlights. The main reason is thatOLED TVs can produce a perfectly dark shade of blackwith no stray illumination of blooming, which leads to better contrast and pop. LED TVs can get brighter, and usually cost less than OLED TVs. At CNET our favorite is Roku for its simplicity, but different systems like Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung and LG have different strengths, in particular for voice commands. In any case, we don't consider the built-in smart TV system that important because you can alwaysconnect a streaming device to any TV. Most TVs sound terrible because their thin cabinets don't have room for decent-sized speakers or a bass. If you want to get good sound you should buy an external audio system. Even an inexpensivesoundbarwill deliver much better audio quality than a TV's built-in speakers.","These are our top picks for the best TVs of 2024 to make the most of your holiday shopping, based on side-by-side testing in CNET's lab.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-tv/,
391,How to Watch the Original Nosferatu to Get in the Mood for the Remake,"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror may be 102 years old, but like its vampire protagonist, Count Orlok, it’s timeless. The German Expressionist flick was anunofficial adaptationof Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula and generally follows the same plot. Put another way, they’re in the same… vein. But since its debut, Nosferatu has influenced many movies and shows, from the 1979 Werner Herzog-directed Nosferatu the Vampyre to George A. Romero’s Martin and the Are You Afraid of the Dark episode The Tale of the Midnight Madness. 2014’s What We Do in the Shadows film even based the design of its character Petyr on the 1922 look of Count Orlok. Now, Nosferatu is being remade again, with director Robert Eggers, of The Witch and The Lighthouse acclaim, at the helm. Given the film’s Dec. 25 release date, tickets to Nosferatu are all I’m asking Santa for this year. While Nosferatu (2024) should be one of December’s biggest box office hits, you may want to watch -- or rewatch -- the 1922 source material before the remake comes out. Here’s how to watch the original Nosferatu. Nosferatu is streaming on a veritable coffin-load of platforms. It’s available to stream at no cost on some of thebest free TV streaming services, includingTubi,Pluto TV,Plex,Crackle, theRoku ChannelandFandango at Home. Because these sites are ad-supported, you’ll need to watch commercials, but just think of this as a nostalgic reminder of what it was like having cable or satellite television back in the day. Tubi is our pick as thebest free TV streaming serviceoverall. Its exhaustive library of movies and TV shows ranges from the familiar to the fringe. Alongside its on-demand content, Tubi has live television. You don’t even need an account to watch videos on Tubi, although a free login lets you save videos to your watchlist and resume playback when switching between your different devices. While you can enjoy the original black-and-white version of Nosferatu from a slew of streaming sites,Amazon Prime Videohas the colorized version. Additionally, Nosferatu is available onAMC Plus, so if you’ve already shelled out for a subscription, you can stream it there. Amazon Prime Video has a colorized version of Nosferatu available to stream for its subscribers. You can also watch plenty of other movies andTV showson Prime Video, including original series likeCross. An Amazon Prime Video subscription costs $9 per month for the streaming service alone. But an Amazon Prime membership, which includes other benefits like free one- and two-day (or even same-day) shipping on eligible items, costs you $15 per month or $139 annually and comes with Amazon Prime Video. Students pay just $7.49 per month or $69 yearly. A subscription to AMC Plus lets you stream Nosferatu (1922) and other movies and shows, including AMC original content like The Walking Dead or TURN: Washington’s Spies. Moreover, an AMC Plus plan provides content from Shudder, Sundance Now and IFC Films Unlimited. You’ll pay $5 per month with ads, $9 monthly without ads or $84 per year for an annual ad-free subscription. Whether you’d like to enjoy thebest possible streaming video qualityon a mobile device, you want tosave money on streaming service subscriptionsor you’re traveling outside of your home country and want toaccess a particular streaming servicefrom abroad, a VPN has you covered. VPNs mask yourpublic IP address, so you can make apps and websites think you’re connecting from a different physical location than where you actually are. So, if you’re traveling abroad in the UK but want to watch Nosferatu on a US-only streaming app, a VPN may let you accomplish this. To stream Nosferatu using a VPN, simply fire up a VPN on your streaming device, mobile device or computer. Hop on a desired server and turn on your VPN connection. Then, launch the streaming app or visit that site in a browser.ExpressVPNis our recommendation as the best VPN for streaming -- and overall for that matter -- butNordVPN,SurfsharkandProton VPNare all excellent choices forgeo-unblocking. ExpressVPN is our Editors’ Choice as the best VPN service overall. Its user-friendly apps, fast internet download speeds and large international server network mean you can easily hop on a server and start streaming. An ExpressVPN plan costs $13 monthly, $100 for the first year (then $117) or $140 total for the first two years (then $150 per year).","Whether a first-time viewing or a rewatch, here’s how to sink your fangs into the 1922 classic film Nosferatu.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-watch-the-original-nosferatu-to-get-in-the-mood-for-the-remake/,

393,Meta Fined $264M for Security Breach in Facebook's 'View As' Feature,"Back in 2018, 29 million Facebook users around the world were affected bya security breach that exposed their personal data. Six years later, the Irish Data Protection Commission, which regulates Facebook's parent company Meta in the European Union, has finally issued the company with a fine for the breach. The DPC announced on Tuesday it was fining Meta 251 million euros ($263.5 million) for failing to prevent cyberattackers from exploiting a vulnerability in Facebook's code. The exploit allowed them to use the site's ""View As"" feature to see people's private profile information. This included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, locations, places of work, dates of birth, religions, genders, posts on timelines, groups of which people were members and children's personal data. ""This enforcement action highlights how the failure to build in data protection requirements throughout the design and development cycle can expose individuals to very serious risks and harms, including a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,"" said DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doylein a statement. ""Facebook profiles can, and often do, contain information about matters such as religious or political beliefs, sexual life or orientation, and similar matters that a user may wish to disclose only in particular circumstances.""

The GDPR has served as a model for many other pieces of privacy legislation around the world, including California's privacy rules. It requires companies to self-report privacy breaches and can result in fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of global revenue, whichever is higher. Meta has been fined almost $3 billion in total for various breaches. The company said on Tuesday that it plans to appeal the DPC's decision. ""This decision relates to an incident from 2018,"" a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement.

You can watch live news broadcasts, on-demand shows and movies and stream content 24/7 on FAST channels. Whether you want reality TV, horror flicks, true crime or kids’ shows, services like Tubi and Pluto TV have older series and films, sort of like basic cable reruns.

Still, other options listed here are considered among the best free streaming services; Pluto TV is great for channel surfers and the Roku Channel can be convenient if you want to watch the news without cable. Here's more on why we think Tubi is the best and other free streamers that enable you to indulge your inner couch potato. Read more:The Best Live TV Streaming Services for Cord Cutters Tubi TVoffers considerably more free movies than TV shows, but it continues to grow its extensive library and its live channel lineup. This ad-supported network doesn't require an account, although signing up for one enables you to save favorites and resume playback if you switch between devices. Tubi offers nationwide and local news livestreams in addition to live sports, weather and entertainment channels. The streaming site's TV selection offers some of the reality shows we've come to expect, such as Hell's Kitchen and Dance Moms, plus oddball inclusions such as the Australian drama McLeod's Daughters. To watch TV series on demand, you can browse by title, network or genre, including a Tubi Kids category. Not every show has full seasons available, but you'll find Broadchurch, Columbo and six seasons of Gossip Girl among the choices. There are also a handful of Tubi originals as well as feature films such as The Goonies and Snowpiercer. Pluto TVis noteworthy for offering not only on-demand, free movie streaming, but also more than 250 live and linear channels on the platform, including BBC Food, CSI, Star Trek and CBS News. Because it's a Paramount-owned brand, Pluto also has episodes of shows like Criminal Minds and Survivor. Pluto offers an impressive selection of live channels sorted into categories like news, reality, sports, comedy and movies in a grid format. On-demand TV content is organized into TV drama series, sitcoms, crime, game shows, sci-fi and more. The layout is not nearly as slick as the live channels, but there's a variety of genres. One oddity: If you're watching a livestream, there's no way to pause. You can only mute it. Roku Channelis a free TV streaming service designed for people who own the company'sstreaming devicesand TVs, but it's also available via Roku's apps for phones and tablets as well asonline. The Roku Channel offers more than 400 live channels including a channel guide, with its existing selection of on-demand content. While the linear TV includes live news and lifestyle channels, the on-demand content ranges from Roku originals (like theWeird Al Yankovic biopic), to reality TV (Hoarders, Kitchen Nightmares) to popular series like 2 Broke Girls and House. You'll also findanime(live and on-demand) and crime shows. Unfortunately, not every TV series is complete (Bewitched, for example), and the service offers only a single episode in some cases. There's plenty of stuff to watch, including a dedicated kids section. There's also a solid array of classic movies, including It's a Wonderful Life and The Usual Suspects. In addition, you can subscribe to premium services including Paramount Plus, much like you can viaPrime Video channelsor the Apple TV app. Although Sling'slive TV packagesstart at $40, Sling Freestream offers more than 40,000 titles of free on-demand TV, and movies and over 500 live TV channels. Sling Freestream is a bulked-up and rebranded version of Sling TV's former offering, Sling Free. Sling TV's free streaming service includes live streams for news, entertainment, sports, kids and more. You'll find channels for ABC News Live, The Walking Dead Universe and Bon Appetit and on-demand selections including Ryan's World, Kim's Convenience and To Kill a Mockingbird. You do not need to create an account when watching Sling Freestream, but if you do, it makes it easier to personalize what you watch, create profiles or use parental controls. The service also gives new users who create an accountaccess to a free DVR. Sling Freestream is available to watch on a web browser and via the Sling app. No payment information is required for viewing. Starting as a way for users to stream content stored on users' computers,Plexhas evolved to incorporate other sources such as free streaming TV. You don't need to install the Plex server, you just stream it with the basic Plex app, or if you want, sign up for an account. More than 600 live TV channels are in the mix with Plex's free streaming service, including Stories by AMC, Hallmark and niche 24/7 streams for certain series, including MythBusters and Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. On-demand content includes The Age of Adaline, Weeds and Kitchen Nightmares.

Your library determines the total number of titles you can borrow each month. A bonus for this service is no commercials are interrupting your viewing experience. Hoopla's TV selection is something of a hodgepodge, with a smattering of well-known shows mixed in with a lot of self-help, documentary and family fare. For example, you'll find two seasons of Chewing Gum, both seasons of The Jim Gaffigan Show and lots of Ken Burns documentaries. Hoopla also has instructional videos from The Great Courses series, various kids shows and plenty of Acorn TV content that would otherwise require a subscription. Film selections rotate on and off the platform, so be sure to check the rotation on a regular basis. With more than 200 streaming services in existence -- globally -- it can be hard sifting through each brand and its offerings. We narrowed this list downbased on several factors, including accessibility, popularity, on-demand content, live channels and reliability. We watched each service on a TV and mobile device to evaluate its user interface and channel roster. These apps can be easily accessed on virtually any media player, smart TV, web browser or mobile device, and they offer a variety of content to suit genre preferences or age ranges. Because they're free services, there's added value for those that offer originals and live channels. When doing test runs of these services, we didn't encounter problems with crashing, lag time or choppy live broadcasts, but your mileage may vary. Peacock: The main way to access Peacock is by being a paying customer. Plans include Premium, which is $8 a month or $80 a year, and Premium Plus, which is $14 a month or $140 a year. NBCUniversal's streaming service also has a free tier, which may or may not be good news for you. As of January 2023, you must already be a Peacock Premium subscriber to use the free version of Peacock. In addition to being exclusive to older users, the tier severely limits what you can watch compared to if you paid for Peacock, so we opted not to include it on this version of our best list. If you've had a Peacock account long enough, the free tier should be available if you aren't actively paying for a Peacock subscription. These are also viable options. You can watch shows from your favorite networks on their dedicated apps but we opted to not include them on this list as some (like ABC) require you to be registered with a cable/TV provider to view the most recent content. Network apps typically allow you to watch new episodes of your shows the next day -- or week -- via their app or website. In some cases, you can also watch live news broadcasts or episode reruns of TV series. Yes. The tradeoff for receiving content to stream for free is that you have to tolerate commercials. Whether you're watching a live channel or on-demand video, each of these services will run ads during your viewing experience. To keep the content free, they have to pay the bills with ads. The only exception on this list is Hoopla. If you're looking for age-appropriate shows and movies, you'll find plenty of titles on Tubi, Roku Channel and Freevee for young children, tweens and teens. Pluto also features dedicated kids' channels with content from Nickelodeon, Lego, Garfield and more.",Tired of spending so much on the big streamers?

395,Reflection Ruining Your Photo? That's Why Adobe Made Its New AI Removal Tool,"Chances are you've taken a perfect photo, with great lighting and composition, that was completely ruined by a reflection. I've certainly had many museum and aquarium shots ruined by the reflection of me holding up my phone, obscuring the painting or sea turtle I'm trying to capture. That's why Adobe's newest editing feature uses AI to make it easier to remove reflections. Reflection removal was announced last week as a brand new feature in the Camera Raw plugin for Photoshop. ""Our goal is to help you turn a photo you might otherwise delete into one that is good enough to share,"" Marc Levoy, Adobe vice president and fellow, said in ablogpost. In an exclusive interview with CNET, Levoy walked us through how the tool works, why the team didn't use generative AI and what comes next. The one-click tool can make a big difference in the before (left) and after (right). Although Levoy has only been at Adobe since 2020, he's a powerhouse in the world of digital photography. His work as a Stanford University researcher helped pioneer computational photography and the digital process of capturing and processing images and graphics. He helped lead Google's respectedPixelcamera app team and is a member of theNational Academy of Engineering. Since joining Adobe, Levoy's worked on a variety of projects with photography and AI. In aninterview with CNET in 2022, Levoy discussed what an Adobe camera app might look like -- one meant for serious photographers with more advanced settings than the point-and-shoot method we've come to associate with smartphones. He also called out how much he'd love to ship a tool to deal with reflections. Now, the one-click reflection removal tech Levoy imagined in 2022 is a reality in Camera Raw. A big part of how the tool works is thanks to AI. However, the feature does not use generative AI, so it doesn't create new elements or regions in an image. Photographs with reflections are like the sum of two different images, Levoy explained. The job of reflection removal -- and the AI model behind it -- is to distinguish the two. ""Removing window reflections comes down to separating a photo that is polluted by reflections into a transmission image (the scene through the window) and a reflection image (the scene behind the photographer). A separation task is very different from a generation task and calls for a different kind of AI model,"" said Levoy. The new reflection removal tool is able to scan the original photo (left) and separate the main subject, the dog (center) from the distracting garden reflection (right). Levoy and his team, Eric Kee and Adam Pikielny, used pairs of clean and reflection-riddled images to generate new images that combined the original image with a reflection. The model then had to correctly identify what the original images were, teaching it to separate the intended subjects from accidental reflections. The removal tool is now adept at isolating the different images, meaning creators don't need to edit out reflections with generative AI. ""There's no reason to use generative AI on those sections where both the transmission and reflection scenes are partly visible,"" said Levoy. For generative-AI-wary photographers, this is good news. Adobe has spent a lot of time and money upgrading its photo and video editing toincorporate AI. AI took center stage at the company's annual creative conference this year, where generative AI was powering everything from smoothervideo transitionsto completelyrelighting dark photos. There might be cases when Adobe's generative AI editing tools could help with photos where the reflections are so bright it saturates the camera sensor to white. But reflection removal offers photographers a nongenerative way to quickly deal with those distractions. In this example of a California tidal pool, reflection removal cleans up those pesky smartphone and sky reflections. Reflection removal currently works with raw images and is available as a beta technology preview (meaning it's available now, but it's still being actively worked on). In the future, Adobe plans to expand the AI tool to be compatible with other image file types, like JPEGs and HEICs, and refine the tool to remove smaller reflections. It also plans to introduce the tool to itsLightroomecosystem, something Levoy is especially jazzed about. ""I can't wait until this feature is available in Lightroom Mobile,"" said Levoy. ""I want to go to the aquarium, take a photo of the shark tank that is polluted by reflections, click a button and admire the resulting clean photo, while the people around me stare in disbelief at the image on my phone. I'll smile and tell them how to download the feature to their own phone."" Correction, Dec. 18:This story originally misstated Marc Levoy's earlier role at Adobe. He was not involved with the Photoshop Camera app.","In an exclusive interview, Adobe's Marc Levoy discusses how his team built a new tool to help photographers remove one of the most annoyingly common errors: glass reflections.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/reflection-ruining-your-photo-thats-why-adobe-made-its-new-ai-removal-tool/,

Most of the headphones on this list are wireless Bluetoothheadphones with active noise cancelation(ANC). That said, many but not all wireless headphones come with a cable for wired listening. I've also included a handful of wired-only over-ear headphones for audio purists looking for that extra level of clarity. Note that this list is regularly updated as more over-ear headphones hit the market, with the most recent addition being theNoble Fokus Apollo.

Return policy Make sure you buy from a reputable source, so you can return the headphones if you try them out and don't care for them. While Bose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. A worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max, we called them the best new noise-canceling headphones of 2023, and they remain a top noise-canceling headphones pick in 2024. SCORE When you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case forSony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher price tag, most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance, as well as even better noise-canceling and more refined sound. SCORE We've always been fans of Sony's MDR-7506 wired studio monitor headphones, which have long been favorite headphones of recording engineers and other sound professionals. The new-for-2024 MDR-M1 are essentially a premium version of the 7506, delivering sound that's hard to match for the price. These are the wired headphones that will make you realize what you're missing after listening to wireless headphones for so long. They feature big, open sound with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass. Not only is their sound a noticeable step up from the 7506's, but these get high marks for their comfort level (they weigh a svelte 216 grams). No, there isn't any noise canceling, but the soft, cushy ear pads offer good passive noise isolation. While they play louder with a headphone amp, they're easy to drive (50 ohms), so you can plug them directly into a computer's headphone port or a smartphone (likely with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter). They come with 1.2m and 2.5m straight detachable cables and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm screw-in plug adapter, but no carrying pouch or case is included. The only downside I see is that the ear pads aren't all that deep, so it's possible those with large ears that stick out a bit might have some issue with the M1's fit -- your ears might press up against the drivers, which are notable for serving up distortion-free audio, even at higher volume levels. That said, they look and feel like an upgraded version of the 7506 so if those worked for you, these should too. Several years in development, Sonos' new Ace headphones are finally available. They're mostly very impressive, though they aren't without a few downsides, including a rather high price tag and some potential glitches with a key feature. But overall they're very well designed and also deliver top-notch sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. SCORE Earfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the 20% instant coupon on their product page to get discount.While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less. They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer). Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. SCORE Sennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors. The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that ""assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste."" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offer ""best-in-class"" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to. SCORE Noble is an audiophile brand known more for its in-ear monitor headphones, but it's got a new-for-2024 wireless noise-canceling headphone called the Fokus Apollo that sounds terrific and features a special dual-driver design that combines a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar-magnetic driver. The result is rich, open sound, with tight bass and excellent treble detail and clarity, especially for a wireless headphone (it sounds a tad better in wired mode but it's not a huge difference). It's more dynamic than many monitor headphones that have a flatter, more neutral sound profile, but it still leans toward being an accurate, well-balanced headphone. The design of the headphones is slightly generic looking, but they have some premium accents (Alcantara material on the headband and protein leather ear pads that are replaceable) and fit my head comfortably. A decent, albeit somewhat large carrying case is included along with a cable for wired listening (USB-C audio is supported). And in case you want to use the headphones for video conference calls at home or do a little multiplayer gaming, a detachable boom microphone ships with the headphones. Equipped with a Qualcomm QC3084 chip (Bluetooth 5.3) and anADIchip, the Fokus Apollo supports a wide variety of audio codecs, including LDAC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC. Interestingly, that's not Qualcomm's higher-end 5-series chip, but I had no issues with wireless performance and voice-calling performance was good with decent noise reduction. Like a lot of audiophile active noise-canceling headphones (ANC), the noise canceling is decent but not up to the level of what Bose, Sony and Apple ANC headphones offer. ANC impacts sound quality, so it's not surprising it's a little lighter with this headphone (there's also a transparency mode and a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak settings). It's also worth noting that you don't get extra bells and whistles like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off -- you're really buying this headphone for its sound quality and those dual drivers. That said, battery life is another plus. It's rated for up 60 hours with ANC on at moderate volume levels. Love 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read ourfull Beats Studio Pro reviewto find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats. SCORE QCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads. The sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones. You do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. That said, the H3 Pro are all in all a very good value, particularly when their price dips closer to $50. The well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening. Sony's improved entry-level noise canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. But they sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these have already seen significant discounts, with prices dropping to as low as $100 during flash sales. SCORE The W830NB is the successor to Edifier's popular W820NB Plus, one of the better value noise-canceling headphones of the last few years. The W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, and the like that earlier model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory-foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android. The W830NB do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB support the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing, however. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included but most computers and smartphones have USB-C now). When Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance. As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products ""visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language."" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to ""help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing."" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to around $250 or possibly less than that in 2024 -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can readour review of the QuietComfort 45to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones. SCORE In 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, new for 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Even though it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras. When I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're a very solid midrange headphone that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200. Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One by Anker are a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space One sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45. Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users. I found them comfortable to wear, but they do look a bit bulky compared to more premium models. Available in gray, blue or black, Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 headphones offer some significant improvements over the first-gen version. Not only are these headphones more comfortable -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- but they sound better and have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5. But the PX7 S2 certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers very good sound with better voice-calling performance, thanks to an upgraded microphone setup. Bowers & Wilkins has also released a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more. We were fans of Beyerdynamic's earlier DT 770 Pro headphones. The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new Stellar.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp. These headphones are targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X are revealing, clean-sounding headphones that offer invitingly open sound (particularly for closed-back headphones) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which are being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X come with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably have a little cleaner look than their predecessor. Solidly built -- they weigh 350 grams -- they're quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for $30 less. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound, but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile. French audio companyFocalis known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. Over three years in development, the Bathys cost $799 and feature not only wireless connectivity but a built-in digital-to-analog converter for USB wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C. They are easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones.  While the Sennheiser 660S2 may seem expensive, it's one of the more affordable true audiophile headphones, sharing the same design as its predecessor, the 660S. The changes are all on the inside, with improved airflow and upgraded drivers that include a new ultralight aluminum voice coil. This leads to better sound, with the bass adding more depth and definition, while the treble gains a bit more clarity and sizzle (the very natural-sounding mids remain pretty much unchanged as far as I can tell). The soundstage also seems more spacious and airy -- yes, these are open-back headphones so they do leak sound. Note that the 660S2 requires some extra power to drive (it's now a 300-ohm headphone), so you'll want to pair it with a dedicated headphone amplifier. I did manage to use it with an iPhone but plugged it into anAudioQuest Dragonfly USB DAC/Ampdesigned for use with iPhones (there's also a version for Android smartphones). It sounded great listening to high-resolution tracks from Qobuz, the music streaming service. Audiophile headphones usually have a very neutral sound profile, but the 660S2 doesn't suffer from being overly so. It mixes in just enough excitement while also managing to sound really clean and smooth. It's also a comfortable headphone, though some people with larger heads have complained that it feels a bit too tight on their heads. (I have a more medium-size head and they felt good over long listening sessions.) All of Master & Dynamic's headphones are well built (they're sturdy) and have a unique retro-modern look. The higher-end MW75 has active noise canceling and sounds a little better than the freshly updated MH40, which features new drivers and a new chipset that delivers improved sound and performance. But the MH40 sounds more refined than its predecessor, with better clarity and definition, and now offers support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs, plus improved voice-calling performance. Additionally, you can plug its USB-C cable into a computer or Android smartphone for a wired digital connection for high-resolution audio. Battery life is rated at a healthy 30 hours. To be clear, this isn't a noise-canceling headphone, but you do get decent passive noise isolation from the nicely padded ear cups, which adhere magnetically and are easy to swap out should they eventually show some wear. Available in several color options, the MH40s are comfortable to wear -- they weigh 280 grams -- but may not be a good fit for those with smaller heads. Introduced way back in 1991, the Sony MDR-7506 have long been favorite headphones of recording engineers and other sound professionals (yes, these are wired headphones). The origins of its design date even further back, since the MDR-7506 headphones are, in fact, a refresh of theSony MDR-V6that rolled out in 1985. Both models were designed for the pro sound market but remain hugely popular with consumers. While the two models have the same design and are very comfortable, they don't sound identical. Both offer very well-balanced sound and excellent clarity for their modest prices -- and both are great overall values. But the MDR-V6 headphones make a little more bass and sound more laid-back and mellow, while the 7506 headphones are leaner with a more accentuated treble range, which makes the sound a little crisper and livelier. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new over-ear headphones. The quality of value-priced headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. But the premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more. The majority of over-ear headphones feature active noise canceling. But it does slightly affect sound quality, so if you're an audio purist, you may want to go with a model that doesn't have noise canceling. You can also sometimes save some money by getting non-ANC headphones, though noise canceling is becoming a fairly standard feature. Most headphones these days are Bluetooth wireless headphones. But you still tend to get the best sound going the wired route. Many wireless headphones also come with a headphone cable for wired listening (and some offer USB-C Audio using a USB-C cable). But we have a few headphones on this list that are wired-only. It's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over the course of a day with minimal breaks. You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. You want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise canceling, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend. It's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. We test over-ear headphones based on six key criteria:design,sound quality,noise-canceling performance,voice-calling performance, featuresandvalue. Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2: A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the 2nd-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours (they now have a quick-charge feature) and also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 a top noise-canceling headphone. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They feature excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure call them a ""studio headphone,"" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference). Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay HX: Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay HX headphones are the successor to the company's H9 series headphones (the X is the Roman numeral for 10) and, like those earlier H9 models, the HX headphones carry a list price of $599 (some colors are discounted at Amazon). That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which are heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads. Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound -- overall, it's well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. V-Moda M-200: V-Moda's M-200 is one of the few wired headphones on this list. Released in late 2019, these clean- and detailed-sounding over-ear headphones have excellent bass response, and the cushy earcups mean they're also comfortable to wear. Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning byRolandengineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M‑200 is Hi‑Res Audio-certified by the Japan Audio Society. Other V-Moda headphones tend to push the bass a little, but this set has the more neutral profile that you'd expect from studio monitor headphones. They come with two cords, one of which has a built-in microphone for making calls. It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks. Note that last year V-Moda released theM-200 ANC($350), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great, but their noise cancellation, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max. Mark Levinson No. 5909(Currently on backorder): These are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. But they're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods, thanks to their nicely padded and replaceable leather-covered earcups and headband. Read ourMark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on. OneOdio A10: The OneOdio A10s deliver more than you'd expect for their relatively modest price, which is why they're featured on several of our best lists. They're built better than you think they would be for around $90 and are pretty comfortable to wear. They have a dual-hinge design and feel sturdy, weighing in at 395 grams, making themperfect headphones for a workout. They sound surprisingly decent and have reasonably good noise canceling with a transparency mode (which has a slight audible hiss, however). The headphones also have very good battery life. No, they're not as comfortable as Bose's and Sony's models (they do feel a tad heavy) and their sound lacks that extra bit of clarity, bass definition and depth that more premium headphones tend to deliver. But they did exceed my expectations and come with a decent carrying case, even if the OneOdio logo splayed across it is a bit garish. Technics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback, but these headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail, although they take a day or two to break in. Usually but not always. Over-ear headphones tend to have bigger speaker drivers (bigger isn't always better when it comes to speaker drivers, but it can be), which can lead to better sound. Also, the way over-ear headphones cover your entire ear can create better acoustics and help passively seal out more ambient noise. It's also worth noting that over-ear headphones tend to be more comfortable than on-ear headphones, though in warmer environments over-ear headphones will steam up your ears more than on-ear headphones. Only if you play them too loud for long periods of time. It's best to keep volume levels in the 50% to 70% range. Lighter headphones tend to be more comfortable, and companies like Sony and Bose have made an effort to shave as much weight as they can off their premium over-ear noise-canceling headphones. You also want headphones that have soft earpads and a comfortable headband, with high-quality memory foam and good padding. Heavier headphones, like Apple's AirPods Max, can be comfortable, but the weight distribution has to be good, along with the cushioning on the headband at the top where it meets the crown of your head. Short answer: both. Either spelling is correct, as ""canceling"" is more common inAmerican English, while ""cancelling"" is more common in British English. CNET uses ""noise-canceling"" since the company is based in the US, but the noise is canceled just the same, regardless of spelling. If you're looking to see what different noise-impacting technology is out there for headphones, check out our article on noise-canceling versus noise-isolating headphones, which highlights differences in function (and not just a difference in spelling). In short, yes. Wireless over-ear headphones can be connected via Bluetooth, if supported by your television. Otherwise, you're likely able to connect your over-ear headphones to your TV through an AUX cable or included wire with the appropriate dongle attachment. But if you're really looking for the best sound from your TV, we recommend investing in agreat soundbarorhome theater systemto bring the movie magic to life.","Looking for a set of great over-ear headphones?

397,Best Projector for 2024,"What to Consider  Picture quality Consider contrast ratio and brightness. A projector with a great contrast ratio will look better than a brighter projector, though the latter will perform better if you want to watch with some lights on. Features The most handy features you can opt for are lens shift and zoom, which make a projector easier to setup. Budget Expect to pay around $1,000 for a quality projector, though models do start around $100. Specifications Though important, many companies tend to inflate contrast and brightness specifications. Use them only as a rough guide. Interested in bringing the movie theater experience to the comfort of your own home? A projector is a better bet than shelling out money on an enormous 85-inch TV. In recent years,home theater projectorshave become easier on the wallet, offering stunning 100-inch-plus images to watch movies, shows and games while chilling in your living room. For a fraction of the cost of abig TV, you can get a massive screen starting at around $200 -- an excellent deal if you’re looking for agift this holiday season. Some models are also portable, making them perfect for abackyard movie nightwith friends. Whether you want LCD, DLP, HD or 4K, these are the best projectors we've tested.

Budget Expect to pay around $1,000 for a quality projector, though models do start around $100. Specifications Though important, many companies tend to inflate contrast and brightness specifications. Use them only as a rough guide. If you're looking for impressive picture quality, good brightness in ambient light, vivid colors and a quality contrast ratio, then theEpson Home Cinema 5050UBis the best overall home theater projector. If you want something less expensive, the best projector for the money is theBenQ HT2060. The best short-throw projector is theBenQ X500i. If you're looking for something more portable, check out the. The Epson Home Cinema 5050UB is the best all-around home projector we've reviewed. Take an excellent contrast ratio, paired with impressive brightness and accurate color, all with better detail than what's possible with a 1080p native resolution projector, and you've got all the pieces for a fantastic image. This home entertainment projector isn't cheap, but it offers a significant step up in image quality over other projectors on this list. Extensive lens shift and a motorized zoom are the icing on the cake. If you want to transform your living room into a home theater, this is the best place to start. The Leisure L570 projector is an affordable, feature-packed home entertainment solution ideal for cost-conscious tech novices. Available atWalmart, it features built-in, officially licensed Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video apps for instant streaming. With native 1080p resolution and dual 5-watt speakers powered by Dolby Audio, the Leisure L570 turns any space into a cinematic escape, delivering stunning visuals and immersive sound you can’t resist. Powered by Vankyo's PixPerfect technology, it offers auto focus adjustment, auto keystone correction, intelligent obstacle avoidance and precise screen alignment for seamless viewing. For the ultimate viewing experience, the Leisure L570 is available atBest Buy, bundled with a 100-inch screen -- everything you need for a complete home entertainment setup. The BenQ HT2060 replaces our longtime favorite, the HT2050A, which is officially discontinued. It has many similarities, including 1080p resolution, lens shift and great color accuracy. The move to LEDs instead of a traditional lamp has two main benefits. First, the LEDs last the life of the projector, so no more replacing lamps. Second, it offers a rich and lifelike image with impressive color accuracy. The downsides are a reduction in brightness overall, and the HT2060 is about 25% more expensive to purchase. However, because you don't need to replace the lamps, the cost of ownership over the projector's lifetime is far lower compared with the HT2050A. Head to head with its predecessor, the older projector still looks great, but overall the HT2060 is a little better. If your budget is around $1,000 and you have a light-controlled room, this is the projector to get. If you need some extreme light output, the Epson HC2350 mentioned below doesn't look quite as good but is far brighter. For smaller rooms, or when placement behind (or above) a couch isn't possible, the BenQ X500i is an excellent option. It needs just 5-6 feet to create a 100-inch image, compared to around 10 feet for a non-short throw projector. It creates a bright, 4K image with tons of contrast and excellent color. Its image is better than many projectors that cost more. The Anker Nebula Mars 3 Air does just about everything right for a portable projector. It creates a relatively bright image, sounds decent, has Google TV built in and is easy to move around and set up. It's a little on the expensive side, but if you're looking for something highly portable for the occasional movie night at home or on the go, it does a great job. There's a new sub-category of projectors that have a pedestal base that rotates and a hinge so the projector can pivot up and down. Ostensibly it makes the projector easier to set up, but it comes at quite a premium compared to a non-gimbaled projector that can also rotate (just turn it) and pivot (built-in feet or propping something under the front). If saving a few minutes of setup is worth that premium to you, the JMGO N1S Pro produces a bright, reasonably accurate image. It also sounds good and has built-in Google TV for streaming. It's also quite bright, so it can compete somewhat with room lights, though like any projector, you'll need some curtains for daytime viewing. The Epson HC2350 is an extremely bright 4K projector at a great price. It has lens shift, built-in streaming and a compact size. Its price has fallen since it was released, so now it goes head-to-head with another favorite of ours: the 1080p BenQ HT2060 mentioned above. The HC2350 is impressively bright. It's one of the brightest projectors we've ever measured. However, its contrast ratio isn't great and is well below average. As a result, its image is more washed out and ""flat"" compared to some other projectors, notably the aforementioned BenQ. While it's 4K, the HC2350 uses LCDs to create its image, so it's susceptible to motion blur. Because of that, it doesn't always look as sharp as you might expect. If you're ready for 4K and need something with extreme brightness, this is the best option anywhere near $1,000. The soda can-sized Anker Nebula Capsule 3 is just about as portable as you can get. It has 1080p resolution, built-in Google TV for streaming and a battery that should last for a long movie or several episodes of your favorite TV show. It's not particularly bright, no projector this size is, but for something you can easily throw in a backpack for a viewing party just about anywhere (anywhere dark, anyway), it's great. If you're looking for something unobtrusive that doesn't stick out like a traditional projector, the BenQ X300G is a black-and-white cube with orange highlights that'll blend better into many rooms. At the very least, it's a lot cooler looking than most projectors. Its performance is very good, creating a colorful image with great contrast. However, it's not particularly bright, especially for its price, but as long as you're not trying to create some massive wall-sized image it'll do fine. It doesn't look quite as good as BenQ's own similarly-pricedX300i, but it should be easier to fit in places that the X300i can't. The tiny P8 serves up a far bigger image than its size suggests. Though in fairness, the handheld size doesn't suggest it could project an image at all -- it looks more like a toy. But it's reasonably bright, has a built-in speaker and costs only $250 or less. Impressive. It doesn't have a battery, nor does it have any streaming apps. So you'll need to take that into consideration. It does have an HDMI input and a USB connection, so you can connect a streaming stick and get all the streaming apps you could possibly want. There are brighter options and better-looking options, but for the price, the P8 is hard to beat. The Epson Home Cinema LS11000 is similar to the Epson 5050, but instead of a lamp, it uses a laser and phosphor combo to create light. This means even better color, no lamp replacements, faster turn on/off and a more usable dynamic contrast ratio. A more advanced different pixel shifter means better resolution than the 5050 as well. It's more expensive to start, but over the life of the laser projector, they should be about the same. So better picture quality for roughly the same total cost of ownership makes this well worth considering over the 5050. The Xgimi Halo Plus is a relatively small 1080p projector with a 2.5-hour battery and surprisingly powerful speakers. It has Android TV built in, so streaming is far easier than with many other portables. It performs well for a portable projector but costs about the same as the BenQ HT2050A, which does a much better job. But for regular movie nights far from an outlet, it works great.

Picture quality:Projectors lag behind TVs when it comes to overall picture quality. However, they largely make up for it with absolutely massive images. Want a TV that's 100-inches or more? Only a projector can do that, ifyou're not ultrarich. Even so, there's a wide range of picture quality even among projectors of a similar price. A projector with a great contrast ratio but only average light output is going to look better than the opposite. However, a brighter projector will be easier to see with some lights on, and can create an even bigger image. Where are you using it?:For light controlled rooms and home theaters, a projector with a high contrast ratio is better than one that prioritizes light output. For mixed-use rooms where it'll be hard or impossible to totally control the ambient light, or if you want an outdoor movie night with an image the size of the side of your house, one that prioritizes light output will be better, because the contrast ratio won't be as noticeable. What about X spec?:Ignore the specs. Companies claim million-to-one contrast ratios, insane brightness ratings, and even more. But the specs are largely divorced from reality. A claimed 2,000 lumen projector isprobablybrighter than a 500 lumen projector, but 1,500 and 1,700 lumen projectors are probably the same. How much should you spend?:$1,000 is the sweet spot with projectors, where you can get great picture quality and brightness. Less than that usually requires a compromise of some kind. Some highly portable and battery-powered models are far less. They're not as bright, but they're great for their intended use. Spending more gets you incremental improvements. Above $3,000 there's a big jump in picture quality again, and from there the sky's the limit. Great picture quality, but they're well beyond what we usually test. What features should you look for?:If you're connecting the projector to an audio system (and you should, eitherreceiver/speakers or soundbar), then you don't really need many features in the projector itself. Just get one that has great picture quality and high brightness. Lens shift and zoom are handy if you want more flexibility in placement. If you're looking for some kind of ""all-in-one"" device with speakers, make sure it has a full version of Android TV inside for streaming, otherwise you'll want to connect a streaming stick like Roku. This is because many highly portable and budget models use the Aptoide store, which won't have as many streaming app options, and those it does have often have compromised functionality (no HD, difficult to navigate, and so on). CNET puts projectors through a rigorous and unbiased testing process that's the culmination of more than two decades of projector reviews. We use specialized test equipment, including a Photo Research spectroradiometer, a Minolta LS-100 luminance meter and an AEMC CA813 illuminance meter. The data is collected and collated byPortrait Displays CalMan Ultimatesoftware, which helps us evaluate every PJ we review. Every lamp-based projector is ""burned in"" for 50 hours before measuring, and all projectors are initially set up using their most accurate color temp and color modes. Test patterns, sent from CalMan, are then used to adjust the various picture settings so the projector looks its best before measurement and evaluation. Contrast ratios are measured in each lamp and iris mode (when available). Once the projectors are fully set up and objectively measured, we watch a variety of content, including TV, movies, and games, both with the projector by itself, and compared side-by-side with two direct competitors. Broadly speaking, we're looking for the three picture quality aspects:contrast ratio, overall light output and color reproduction. Contrast ratio is the most important part of any projector's performance. It's the difference between the darkest part of the image and the brightest. While certain TV technologies, like OLED, can create a black that's the actual absence of light, no projector technology can do this. Because of this, contrast ratios with projectors are far lower. It's the difference between a washed out and ""flat"" image and one that's more lifelike and ""pops."" The better projectors will have a measured contrast ratio in the thousands. Most are between 500-1000:1. Light output is the second most important factor, because it's not only how bright the image appears on your wall, but also how big an image you can produce. Most modern projectors are significantly brighter than projectors from even 10 years ago. We measure brightness in candelas per square meter (cd/m2) and then convert to estimated lumens for ease of comparison. It's important to note that we use the most accurate color temperature mode for our brightness comparisons, but we'll note when a less-accurate mode is significantly brighter. Most of the projectors we test are between 1,000-2,000 lumens, with battery-powered models far less, and some specialized projectors even higher. Color accuracy is the last major factor. No projector can truly take advantage ofHDR or wide color gamut, but some can do more than others. Generally, we're satisfied with accurate colors, but adding HDR effects is a bonus. Most home theater projectors we test are fairly accurate. Budget models, those that prioritize brightness over everything, and PJs from newcomers to the projector space, often have wildly inaccurate colors that result in a very unnatural image. Other factors, like video processing and HDR processing, are evaluated in the viewing tests. These are rarely a major factor in projector performance, but some models still use older chips that have issues. The best projector will have a high contrast ratio, high brightness and great color. Those are difficult to do at the same time, but as long as the balance works and it looks better than its competitors at a similar price, it's a winner.

Xgimi Horizon Ultra: The Horizon Ultra (image above) has a stylish design and is capable of an extremely bright image. However, its contrast ratio is quite poor. Check out our review of theXgimi Horizon Ultra. Optoma GT2100HDR: The GT2100HDR is a bright short-throw projector with 1080p resolution. It lacks any zoom and is outclassed by the, admittedly more expensive,BenQ X500i"" target=""_self. Check out our review of theOptoma GT2100HDR"" target=""_self. BenQ GS50: The GS50 is a lunch box-size 1080p projector with a built-in battery. You can even use it as a Bluetooth speaker. However, it's dimmer than the Xgimi Halo Plus for similar money, so we recommend that one instead. Samsung Freestyle: The small, cylindrical Freestyle is an interesting idea, but it comes up short. It's about the size of a Bluetooth speaker and in fact can double as one, and the Freestyle can pivot on its stand to project an image at any height on walls and even the ceiling. Its built-in streaming is far better implemented than with most portable projectors. However, it lacks a battery and its performance is average, at best. Worse, its price is a good 50% higher than it should be based on how it looks and performs.Read our Samsung Freestyle review. Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2: Another relatively expensive projector we didn't love, the Xiaomi at least has a gorgeous, Apple-like design going for it. We appreciated the compact size, 1080p resolution and built-in Android TV streaming, but the cons outweigh the pros. It's relatively dim, especially for the price, and it lacks both a built-in battery and compatibility with a USB power source, so it's not truly portable.Read our Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 review. Epson Home Cinema 880: The 880 is one of Epson's less expensive home projectors, but it still puts out a remarkable amount of light. That and the price make it tempting. The contrast ratio is terrible, however, so the overall image quality is weak.Read our Epson Home Cinema 880 review. Vimgo P10: The Vimgo P10's price fluctuates between $70 and $270, in the same ballpark as our favorite cheap projector, the AAXA P8. It's a lot larger than the P8. It's the largest cheap projector we've tested, actually, making it far less portable. But it's still ""small"" compared with full-size and more expensive projectors, however. LG HU810PW: The HU810PW is a higher-end, laser-powered projector with 4K resolution that's able to create some lovely, colorful images. It's also quiet and sports an attractive, boxy case. The contrast ratio is quite poor, so it doesn't look nearly as good overall as other projectors in its price range.Read our LG HU810PW review. Anker Nebula Solar Portable: The Solar Portable is a portable projector with a built-in battery that lasts three hours. It sports 1080p resolution, but it's not very bright and the contrast isn't great. Though the Anker Mars II Pro has its own issues, overall it's the better option for the same money.Read our Anker Nebula Solar Portable review. Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K:Since it has a handle and it's a compact size, the Cosmos Laser 4K is technically portable, but it's hardly mini at more than 10 pounds. There's also no battery, so you'll need to plug it in. It's nice and bright, but the other downsides -- lack of zoom, average overall image quality and a steep price for what you get -- keep it off this list.Read our Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K Projector review. Mini projectors are projectors small enough to hold easily in one hand. They're incredibly portable, but they're not as bright as their larger counterparts, nor do they look as good. Overall, we like theAAXA P8for its small size and high performance for its category. For more options, check out our list of thebest portable mini projectors. If you want to move movie night outdoors, you have a few options. We generally recommend, when possible, using a regular home projector and running an extension cord. Home projectors will offer far better, brighter images for the same amount of money or less compared to portable projectors. If you want to go fully cordless, we like theXgimi Halo Plus. It's fairly expensive, but offers decent battery life and image quality. For more options, check out our list of thebest outdoor projectors. LCD and Digital Light Processing projectors are the most common technologies. Higher-end projectors often use LCOS, or liquid crystal on silicon, designs. These are marketed as SXRD and DILA. LCOS is superior to LCD and DLP in almost every way, but it's also significantly more expensive. LCD (used almost exclusively by Epson) and DLP both have their strengths and weaknesses. DLP is typically sharper, while LCD often brighter. However, both technologies offer bright, sharp images. It's more down to the specific model of projector than  technologies. You can use any flat surface to project your image. However, don't expect any surface to be the best for a projector. Any and all tiny bumps in a wall, for example, will be visible as extra ""noise"" in the image. If you want the best image quality from your projector, even an inexpensive screen is a far better option. This is because projector screens tend to brighten the image noticeably and create a smooth surface that best shows off your TV program, movie or game. Portable models are expensive for their performance, but they can work where there's no outlet. If you don't plan on ever using the projector away from your house, a traditional projector will be far brighter and can be used outside. Just remember to bring it inside when you're done. The Epson Home Cinema 5050UB boasts the best picture quality of our best projector picks. While certainly not a budget option, the 5050UB offers excellent performance in rooms with ambient light, vibrant color and superior contrast ratio and is a significant step up in image quality over its competitors. Yes, most projectors can connect to your phone. If you're okay with a few cables, you can connect your device via an adapter or ""dongle"" to the projector's HDMI or USB inputs. For a wireless connection, you'll need a Bluetooth-enabled projector to pair your phone or tablet. You can also opt for athird-party media box or streaming stick, though these still require an HDMI port. Either way, displaying your phone on the big screen is easier than ever with modern projectors. A short-throw projector can create a 100-inch image from a distance of just 5 feet, while a traditional home projector can create the same size image from around 10 feet. They're especially helpful in narrower or smaller rooms where it may be hard to get a traditional projector far enough away to create the desired image size. The projected image can also be extremely bright -- even in rooms with more ambient light. With the promise of simple installations and impressive brightness specs, short-throw projectors are an excellent option for those looking to improve their home viewing experience without the hassle.","Discover the best projector for 2024 with our expert-tested picks from Epson, Anker and more for every budget and need.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-projector/,
398,Best Prepaid Phone Plans for December 2024,"Ditching the big-league carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon for a smaller provider could be the best move to slash those monthly phone bills. Smaller carriers like Boost Mobile, Cricket Mobile, Mint Mobile and more now offer competitive prepaid plans that often beat the giants, especially when it comes to pricing on unlimited data -- all without locking you into long-term contracts. In my decade-plus of covering the wireless scene, I’ve sifted through countless plans to find the gems. Whether you’re after a modest plan with under 5GB, something heftier with under 15GB or the best unlimited deals, here are our top picks that deliver big savings and great service. US Mobile runs on Verizon's network for its ""Warp 5G"" service, T-Mobile's for its ""GSM""/""Light Speed"" offering and AT&T for its ""Dark Star"" option. Now its cheapest Unlimited Flex option starts at $17.50 per line, per month when purchased annually ($210 total). That's significantly cheaper than its Unlimited Starter and Visible's offer (even Visible's latest promotion that knocks its base plan down to $20 a month for two years with a promo code), but it comes with some caveats. Taxes and fees are still included in the sticker price, but you'll now get 10GB of high-speed data and 5GB of hotspot data (unless you want to add it for $30 for the year). To add more high-speed data, international roaming or streaming perks, you'll need to step up to the carrier's pricier Unlimited Starter or Premium plans. If you don't want to prepay for a year Unlimited Starter normally runs $25 per month. It is worth noting that if you want to switch networks, you get two free switches but then it will cost you $2 each time you ""teleport."" Verizon's Visible has long been competitive in the prepaid space. At $25 per month, it's not a bad alternative if you want Verizon's network. Opting for the annual fee, it is $275 for the year. Through Jan. 31, it is offering $5 off the monthly price of its base plan (making it $20 per month instead of its usual $25) for 25 months so long as you use promo code ""SWITCH25"" at checkout. The base plan includes unlimited talk, text and data on Verizon 5G and 4G LTE networks but you won't be able to take advantage of Verizon's fastest networks. Unlimited hotspot is also included, though it is capped at speeds of 5Mbps. Those who want faster data speeds for their regular data and hotspot connections, plus unlimited talk, text and 2GB of data every day in Canada and Mexico need to look at Visible's pricier Visible Plus plan that normally runs $45 per month ($35 per month with this promotion). All that said, if you don't need Verizon's fastest possible speeds, don't want to outlay a full year's service in one shot and want to be on Verizon's network, it's hard to beat this price. Taxes and fees are also included in this price. Google's phone service hasraised its monthlypricingfor group plans, making the service a bit less appealing compared with major providers. A family of four, for instance, will now pay $100 per month ($25 per line) to get the Simply Unlimited plan. This used to run $80 per month ($20 per line). The plan includes not only unlimited talk, text and 35GB of high-speed data but also 5GB of mobile hotspot use. There's also free roaming in Canada and Mexico, although taxes and fees aren't included in the sticker price. Google Fi Wirelessruns largely on T-Mobile's network and its service includes 5G access. This one is actually a bit complicated. Cricket and Metro each offer perks with some of their top unlimited plans -- in the case of Cricket, you get a subscription to Max with ads, while Metro's top two unlimited plans offer one year of ViX Plus and 100GB of Google One storage. While Metro used to be cheaper, it has become pricier and dropped the inclusion of Amazon Prime on its main plan. Metro actually still has those plans but has hidden them under aHeritage Planssection on its website that requires you to call customer support to get them. This runs for an undisclosed limited time, but if you're willing to go down this route, it's the best option. A single line runs $60 per month, while three or four lines will cost you $120 per month. This is significantly cheaper than the company's new Metro Flex Plus options that also include Prime (plus more hotspot data and a free phone or discounts on new phones) but runs $140 per month for three lines and $175 per month for four. Taxes and fees are also included in that Heritage price, as is 15GB of hotspot data, 100GB of Google One and a subscription to Amazon Prime. Again, you need to contact Metro's Customer Care team at 888-863-8768 to get this plan. More details can be foundhere. Other options: As for the new main plans, for a single line or two lines Metro's Flex Start plan is still actually a bit cheaper than Cricket's. A single line here is $50 per month while two lines are $85 per month. That's slightly cheaper than Cricket's option which runs $55 per month for a single line (with AutoPay) or $90 for two lines. Cricket gets ahead if you need three lines, $110 per month versus Metro's $120 monthly rate, and includes Max with Ads and more hotspot data (15GB versus 8GB from Metro's Flex Start). It wins this battle. When you get to four or more lines, Cricket's plans are actually $25 per month cheaper than Metros, once again making it the better play. Verizon's Total by Verizon service includes Disney Plus' Premium no-ads option with its top plan, but at $60 per month for a single line and $165 per month for four lines, it's probably not worth it. If price is the biggest factor for you, look at Google Fi's Simply Unlimited plan we mentioned above. If you need anything less than four lines, Cricket, Total or Metro are a lot pricier than Mint. One phone line with this top unlimited plan runs $60 a month, two lines are $90 a month and three lines are $120. If you're looking for service for a backup phone that's rarely used, TextNow has a free plan. Running on T-Mobile's network, the service offersfree unlimited talk and unlimited texting, although ads are placed in its app that you use to call and text people. There isn't any data included with this option, and removing the ads without adding data would run you $10 a month. If you want to watch YouTube, FaceTime or surf the web, you'll need to connect to Wi-Fi. Text messages are also done through the company's TextNow app, not through iMessage or WhatsApp, which makes sense because those services require data. A recent change from TextNow lets you get unlimited talk and text (through its app) as well as 1GB of data per monthfor a handful of apps, like Gmail, Waze, Uber, Lyft, Outlook, Apple Maps and Google Maps. All you need to do is buy a TextNow SIM card, which is a one-time $5 charge. If you need more data, well, things will get expensive quickly. An unlimited data hour pass runs $1 per hour, a day pass is $5 and a month is $40. If you need data, you're better off going with a different provider than TextNow. If you are largely on Wi-Fi and don't use much data then US Mobile's Light Plan is the go-to pick for low-cost but still with some data service. Buried under its other plans, the Light Plan includes unlimited talk and text as well as 2GB of data. This is better than our previous pick, Boost Mobile's new customer offer which gave you 1GB of data per month for a full year for $100. At $96 for the year, this is cheaper than Boost's offer and includes taxes and fees in that sticker price. If you don't want to pay annually, it's $10 per month. Other options:Boost Mobile, our previous pick in this spot, has recentlyswitched its focus towards unlimited plans. Outside of Boost, Mint Mobile has a 5GB for $15 per month option, though Mint requires new users to be on its three-month plan (or prepay for the year) to get that rate. Boost Mobile allows you to do this monthly as a new customer (with a three-month option available as well). Metro, Total by Verizon and Cricket each charge $30 a month for 5GB of data and Tracfone has a 4GB data plan, but that runs $25 when on auto-refill ($30 without). T-Mobile has afew T-Mobile Connect dealsincluding a $15 per month option with unlimited talk/text and 5GB of data. The carrier also has a $10 per month Connect option that includes 1,000 domestic minutes for talk, 1,000 domestic and 1GB of data. As we said at the top, the best deal is the one that works best for you. When it comes to data under 15GB, Mint once again has the best value if T-Mobile's network is solid in your area. Getting 15GB of 4G LTE/5G monthly data is $20 per month at Mint if you're a new subscriber and buy in 12-month increments. After that, you can buy three more months at $35 per month ($105 total), six months at $25 per month ($150 total) or another year at $20 per month ($240 total). Other options:Google Fi has a ""bill protection"" feature designed to refund you for data you don't use, but with a maximum monthly charge of $80 per month for one line and 6GB of data and unlimited talk and text, I think you're better off looking elsewhere instead of having to calculate how much data you're using. MobileX has an unlimited option with 10GB of high-speed data for $14.88. The carrier also will recommend a monthly data allotment (based on your usage) to customize your plan. AT&T has an online offer of 16GB per month if you prepay the $300 for a full year (equating to $25 per month). If you use up the 16GB, you will still get unlimited data, but it will slow speeds down to 1.5Mbps until your month resets. Tracfone's 10GB plan generally runs $40 per month, though you can prepay for a year for $384 (which breaks down to $32 monthly). The perk with the AT&T and Tracfone plans is that any unused data carries over to the next month. For the latter, if you're looking for a prepaid provider on Verizon that could be your pick. Before we get to the plans, to get the best deal you need to make sure you have the coverage that you need. This makes it very hard for us to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon is more reliable. Your mileage may vary, but the good news is that these networks are growing and improving all the time, particularly as the three major players race to blanket the U.S. with 5G. It's quite possible that you left a network complaining about its sparse service a decade ago, but now it's beefed itself up because of that race to acquire customers. If you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such asT-Mobile's Network Pass. Verizonoffers a similar 30-day programwhileAT&T has recently introduced its own 30-day eSIM free trial optionfor sampling its network. As with the leading carriers, there are periods when the prepaid players offer deals. Boost Mobile used to run a promo for new customers that let you get three lines with unlimited talk, text and data for $90 per month ($30 per line) after ""your first payment of $100."" It has since added a new unlimited plan that is $25 per month for new users, although each line must be separate and can't be grouped on a family plan. Some prepaid providers will even give discounts on buying a new device, but unlike the leading carriers, don't expect the same big promotions offering a free new iPhone or Samsung's latest Galaxy. Those deals are often tied to 24- or 36-month installment plans, which prepaid -- by its nature -- doesn't offer. Picking a wireless plan and carrier is a very individualized process. What works for you and your family's needs may be vastly different from your friends or neighbors. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work best on Verizon or T-Mobile (and vice versa). The picks we make are based on over a decade of covering and evaluating wireless carriers, their offerings and overall performance. In particular we take into account the follow:1. Coverage2. Price3. Value4. Perks Since all three major providers blanket most of the country with good 4G LTE or 5G this is largely a toss-up on a macro level and why we recommend a variety of eSIM options for figuring out what works best for you in your particular location so you can best decide what is right for you. Looking at coverage maps on each provider's website will likely show that you get good coverage even if your experience isn't full bars or the fastest speeds.This is also why with prepaid plans we specify which network each prepaid provider uses as they sometimes make that a bit difficult to figure out. Value is factoring in the total experience you might get, such as how much high-speed data you get and what's included in the sticker price. We compare it with other similar offerings to figure out which gives the best deal. Perks are add-ons beyond the core components of wireless service (talk, text and data). This could range from bundling in or discounting on streaming services like Disney Plus or Prime Video to extra hotspot data or the ability to use your phone internationally. There are two main types of ways to pay for phone service: postpaid, where you pay at the end of the month, and prepaid, where you buy service before you use your phone. The advertisements you see for AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are almost always for postpaid plans, while the plans and carriers we're talking about here are all prepaid plans. You're buying the data and access to it in advance of using it. Prepaid plan providers let you purchase in various increments -- 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months or even a full year -- with prices often varying depending on how long you're willing to commit. In this story, I'm comparing single-year prepaid cellphone plans. As I noted when covering thebest unlimited plans, to get the most out of your deal you need to make sure you have the coverage you need. This makes it hard to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier: T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, for example, Verizon is more reliable. Prepaid providers almost always use someone else's service. Before you sign up for one, it's worth checking what the underlying network is. Each offers some version of 5G andI've broken this all down here, but to recap: If you have any friends or family in your area who already use the prepaid carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. As mentioned above, you could also go to a major carrier's store and see if it offers free ways to try out the service before switching over, such as T-Mobile'sNetwork Pass,Cricket's trial program(for AT&T's network) orVerizon's trial program.","When it comes to finding a prepaid phone plan, traditional carriers like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile aren't your only options.

399,Best Cheap Phone Plans for December 2024,"While ditching pricey streaming services or skipping the occasional dinner out can save cash, your phone plan is a necessity you can’t just cut – but you can find a cheaper one. There are plenty of ways to do just that, from prepaid carriers like Mint Mobile to cable companies' plans like Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile and Charter’s Spectrum Mobile. Cheap phone plans have many of the features traditional plans offer, including unlimited data, at a fraction of the cost from giants like AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile. With more than 10 years of reviewing, I’ve listed our top picks for the best cheap phone plans and some other ways to save on your bill. US Mobile, which runs on Verizon's network for its ""Warp 5G"" service, AT&T's for its ""Dark Star"" option and T-Mobile's for its ""GSM"" or ""Light Speed"" offering, has recently updated its plans again. Now its cheapest Unlimited Flex option starts at $17.50 per line, per month when purchased annually ($210 total).

If you don't need Verizon's fastest possible speeds, don't want to outlay a full year's service in one shot and want to be on Verizon's network, this is a solid deal. Taxes and fees are also included in the cost. Other options: Cricket Wireless' unlimited plans for single lines start at $55 per month while Metro's cheapest unlimited plan runs $50 per month. Total by Verizon runs $40 per month for unlimited. All are significantly higher than US Mobile or Visible. The only other unlimited plans worth considering are Mint Mobile ($30 per month) and MobileX's ($24.88 per month). Mint includes 40GB of high-speed data on T-Mobile's network while MobileX offers 30GB of unlimited data on Verizon's. Both are pricier than our other picks especially as neither includes taxes or fees. Google's phone service has adjusted its pricing which makes it a bit less appealing compared to major providers. For a family of four, you can now get its Simply Unlimited plan for $100 per month ($25 per month, per line), which includes not only unlimited talk, text and 35GB of high-speed data but also 5GB of mobile hotspot use. It includes free roaming in Canada and Mexico, although taxes and fees aren't included in the sticker price. This used to be $80 per month ($20 per month, per line) butGoogle has raised its pricing. Google Fi Wirelessruns largely on T-Mobile's network and its service includes 5G access. US Mobile, which runs on Verizon's network for its ""Warp 5G"" service, T-Mobile's for its ""GSM"" or ""Light Speed"" offering and AT&T for its ""Dark Star"" option. Now its cheapest Unlimited Starter option starts at $25 per line, per month, which for a family of four would run $100 per month. Taxes and fees are included in the sticker price, and (after another recent change) you'll now get 35GB of high-speed data, 10GB of hotspot data and 1GB of international data per line, per month. To add more high-speed data, international roaming or streaming perks, you'll need to step up to the carrier's pricier Unlimited Premium plans. It is worth noting that if you want to switch networks, you get two free switches but then it will cost you $2 each time ""teleport."" Other options:You could do this with Visible's plans as well, although we give US Mobile the edge here because of the variety of networks it works with. AT&T's prepaid brand has a decent deal if you're looking for four lines: $25 a month for unlimited talk, text and data. A single line is $55 a month, but Cricket gives a solid discount if you're willing to add more lines to the account. Unlike Visible, this is a traditional-style family plan, where one person pays for all the lines, so you may want to do this with people you know and can rely on to pay on time. Although it's nearly identical in price, Visible's plan includes unlimited hotspot data, giving it the edge over Cricket. Like Visible, Cricket includes taxes in the price. Cricket's T-Mobile rival, Metro, has a similar four lines for $100 a month unlimited deal, but you'll need to go through itsHeritage plansand customer support to sign up. Other options:Beyond the Metro option you could look at Total Wireless (owned and run by Verizon) which has a similar four-line option for $100 per month. Taxes and fees are included here, but Total's data is on Verizon's slower networks compared to the Verizon experience you may get through US Mobile. If you're looking for service for a backup phone that's rarely used, TextNow has a free plan. Running on T-Mobile's network, the service offersfree unlimited talk and unlimited texting, although ads are placed in its app that you use to call and text people. There isn't any data included with this option, and removing the ads without adding data would run you $10 a month.

At $96 for the year, this is cheaper than Boost's offer and includes taxes and fees in that sticker price. If you don't want to pay annually, it's $10 per month. US Mobile offers service on all three carriers: Verizon for its ""Warp 5G,"" T-Mobile for its ""GSM"" and AT&T for its ""Dark Star."" It is worth noting that if you want to switch networks, you get two free switches but then it will cost you $2 each time ""teleport."" To get the best deal, you need to make sure you have the coverage that you need. Cutting costs won't help if it means the service won't work for you. The US' complex geographic variables make it hard for us to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon could be more reliable.

Read more:Best Unlimited Plans When it comes to prepaid carriers and mobile options from cable companies you should also check to see which network they are using. Mint Mobile, for instance, runs on T-Mobile's service (andhas been acquired by T-Mobile), while Comcast's Xfinity Mobile and Charter's Spectrum Mobile use Verizon. In these cases, downloading either of the two apps above could be a quick and easy way to try out T-Mobile or Verizon's coverage in your area before you switch. We have a list of a few of the major alternative providers and which networks they run on broken downhere. Picking a wireless plan and carrier is a very individualized process. What works for you and your family's needs may be vastly different from your friends or neighbors. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work best on Verizon or T-Mobile (and vice versa). The picks we make are based on over a decade of covering and evaluating wireless carriers, their offerings and overall performance. In particular, we take into account the following: coverage, price, value and perks. Since all three major providers blanket most of the country with good 4G LTE or 5G this is largely a toss-up on a macro level and why we recommend a variety of eSIM options for figuring out what works best for you in your particular location so you can best decide what is right for you. Looking at coverage maps on each provider's website will likely show that you get good coverage even if your experience isn't full bars or the fastest speeds.This is also why with prepaid plans we specify which network each prepaid provider uses as they sometimes make that a bit difficult to figure out. Value is factoring in the total experience you might get, such as how much high-speed data you get and what's included in the sticker price. We compare this to other similar options to figure out our best picks. Perks are add-ons beyond the core components of wireless service (talk, text and data). This could range from bundling in or discounting on streaming services to extra hotspot data or the ability to use your phone internationally.  There are two main types of ways to pay for phone service: postpaid, where you pay at the end of the month, and prepaid, where you buy service before you use your phone. The advertisements you see for AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are almost always for postpaid plans, while the plans and carriers we're talking about here are all prepaid plans. You're buying the data and access to it in advance of using it. Prepaid plan providers let you purchase in various increments -- 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months or even a full year -- with prices often varying depending on how long you're willing to commit. In this story, I'm comparing single-year prepaid cellphone plans. If you want to stick with a major carrier such as AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile, one easy way to save is to take advantage of its discounts. All of the carriers offer additional discounts that you could be eligible for, depending on your employer, military status, student status or age. First responders, military members, veterans, nurses and teachers can get discounts on every major carrier.Verizon has discountsfor students, while T-Mobile's Work perk couldknock 15% off the Go5G Plus plan. AT&T offers a similar program for itsUnlimited Elite and Premium plans,called Signature, and has rolled out a promotion for teachers thatoffers 25% off its latest unlimited plans. If you're 55 or older, you may also be eligible for a discounted plan:T-Mobileoffers discounted plans nationwide for as low as $55 a month for two lines, andVerizonandAT&Toffer similar options -- but only for Florida residents. We've also rounded upthe best plans at the Big Three.  As I noted when covering thebest unlimited plans, to get the most out of your deal you need to make sure you have the coverage you need. This makes it hard to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier: T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, for example, Verizon is more reliable. ave Prepaid providers almost always use someone else's service. Before you sign up for one, it's worth checking what the underlying network is. Each offers some version of 5G andI've broken this all down here, but to recap: If you have any friends or family in your area who already use the prepaid carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. As mentioned above, you could also go to a major carrier's store and see if it offers free ways to try out the service before switching over, such as T-Mobile'sNetwork Pass,Cricket's trial program(for AT&T's network) orVerizon's trial program.","Looking for a good phone plan on a budget this holiday season? Here are our top picks for the best cheap phone plans, not just those from the Big Three carriers.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-cheap-phone-plan/,
400,Best Family Phone Plans for December 2024,"Picking a family phone plan isn't always as easy as it should be. There are multiple carriers, each with its selection of plans and a host of pros, cons and fine print. Then there are upgrades and deals to consider, as well as what features everyone needs or if the perks like free Netflix, extra hotspot data or bundled international roaming make sense for you or any of the people in your group. After covering the wireless industry for over a decade, we’ve picked the best plans for three or more lines from T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T (though we didn't pick any from AT&T).  Whether you’re upgrading phones or just hunting for the best deal, here are the best family phone plans available today. Because T-Mobile restructured its cheapest plans, this has gotten a bit more complicated. As mentioned above, both T-Mobile Essentials and Essentials Saver include unlimited talk, text and data for all the carrier's base unlimited plans, including 5G access. In short, if you need two lines, Essentials Saver is your best pick, while those looking for three or more lines may want to go with regular Essentials. Two lines of Essentials Saver run $80 a month, while a similar offering from Verizon costs $110 a month, and a similar deal from AT&T runs $122 a month. Three lines will also run $90 at T-Mobile for its regular Essentials thanks to a promotion, compared with $120 at Verizon (for Unlimited Welcome) and $138 at AT&T (for Unlimited Starter SL). The four-line option is now back to $100 at T-Mobile thanks to some promotions and is a bit cheaper compared with $120 at Verizon and $144 at AT&T. Make sure to go with T-Mobile's ""Essentials 4 Line Offer"" to get the four lines for $100 per month deal and not the regular Essentials (which is $105 per month). If you're comparing prices on multiple carriers' websites, keep in mind that Verizon's pricing by default factors in a switching promotional discount of $180 over three years for Unlimited Welcome, or $540 if you're getting Unlimited Plus. In either case, it's assuming you aren't also getting a new phone when you switch. To get the real numbers of Verizon's plans make sure to add $5 a line to its Welcome prices and $15 a line for Plus. Our pricing above removes the BYOD device credit. Our pricing here also assumes no perks from Verizon. As for T-Mobile, its prices also come with a couple of caveats: Unlike the carrier's Go5G or Magenta plans, taxes and fees aren't included in any of these Essentials prices, making the final total a little higher. All the deals also require that you set up AutoPay and paperless billing. As mentioned, you may need to click ""see more plans"" on T-Mobile's site to get this option to appear. This is a bit more complicated. Verizon used to be our pick with its Play More plan that bundled in the Disney bundle (ad-free Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu with ads) and services like Google Play Pass or Apple Arcade into the plan's sticker price. Now the carrier has updated its wireless plans to remove perks like the Disney bundle or Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass from being automatically included with its service. Even with its new plans, it's still our pick for best perks, but this will require a bit more explanation. Instead of automatically putting services in, it now offers a variety of perks at $10 a month per perk, allowing you to pick and choose what you want. It also now allows its lower-cost plan, known as Unlimited Welcome, to participate. Unlimited Welcome runs $65 a month for one line or $120 a month for four lines. You get unlimited talk, text and data, but you don't get access to Verizon's fastest 5G networks (what it calls ""5G Ultra Wideband"") or hotspot data. For that, you will need to step up to its pricier Unlimited Plus plan ($80 for one line, $180 for four lines). Both the Welcome and Plus plans include the ability to add perks at that $10 per month rate. This includes the Disney Bundle (normally $15 a month), Apple One individual (normally around $17 a month), Apple Music Family (which can be shared with five people and normally runs $17 a month) and Walmart Plus (normally $13 a month but also includes Paramount Plus Essential). There are also other perks including an additional 100GB of hotspot data (normally $45 a month), 2TB of Verizon's cloud storage (normally $15 a month), three days of international data (what the carrier calls TravelPass, normally $10 a day). All perks can be turned on or off at will, and you could forgo them entirely. You can even go with multiple perks on a single line. Whether this makes sense for your situation may require some time with a spreadsheet going through what services work for you and what you're willing to pay for them. The savings could add up if you're paying for some of these services directly, but it also could be more expensive than your existing plan. It's also worth mentioning that Verizon allows you to ""mix and match"" lines, so if not everyone needs the faster 5G connectivity, they could be on Unlimited Welcome, while the one who does can go on Unlimited Plus. AT&T allows something similar with its unlimited plans, but at the moment it no longer offers any streaming perks. To get T-Mobile's perks, everyone has to be on the same plan. If you wanted a cheaper way to save on one or two services like the Disney bundle, you could have four lines for $120 a month, add the Disney perk for $10 and pay $130 a month for the whole package. Oh, and you can also combine these plans with Verizon's other discounts for teachers, nurses, military and first responders to save a bit more. T-Mobile's new plans are also a bit complicated. For most people, T-Mobile's Magenta and Magenta Max options are the better pick when it comes to looking for perks for one or two lines. They're cheaper than the new Go5G options and have most of the same features, except with a cheaper monthly rate ($70 for one line on Magenta, $120 for two lines; $85 for one line on Magenta Max, $140 for two lines). You get less hotspot and international data with a Magenta plan compared to a Go5G option, and Magenta Max users also don't get the same ability to upgrade to a new device after two years while taking advantage of T-Mobile's ""new customer"" deals. Thanks to T-Mobile offering a free third line on its Go5G options, those plans become cheaper and a better value compared to the Magentas if you need three or more lines. Among the benefits of Magenta and Go5G ($75 a month for one line, $155 a month for four lines) are unlimited international data (albeit at slow ""2G speeds"") when traveling in over 210 countries, an hour of in-flight Wi-Fion several airlines, T-Mobile Tuesdays weekly giveaways, the bundling of Netflix's Standard with Ads plan (which is $7 a month) and six free months of Apple TV Plus. Its pricier Magenta Max and Go5G Plus ($90 a month for one line, $185 a month for four lines) plans keep the Netflix Standard with Ads plan, include a full subscription to Apple TV Plus, ups the hotspot data from 15GB on Go5G to 50GB per month on Go5G Plus, adds 5GB of high-speed international data and gives you unlimited Wi-Fi on a host of flights including those from American, Alaska Airlines, Delta and United. Go5G Plus also has 15GB of high-speed data in Canada and Mexico, compared to 10GB on Go5G and 5GB on Magenta and Magenta Max. Unlike its Essentials plans discussed earlier, T-Mobile also includes taxes and fees with the pricing of its Magenta and Go5G plans. Note:You need to switch to T-Mobile and have an eligible trade-in. T-Mobile's switcher offer is once again very tempting if you're looking to switch to the carrier and need new devices. You get four lines of its Essentials plan and four new iPhone 16 models for $100 monthly. You can find it by scrolling downthe carrier's Apple deals page. As always, there is some fine print to be aware of. Here is what that is. Like other carriers, you need to commit to being with T-Mobile for 24 months (which is better than AT&T and Verizon's respective 36-month installment plans). Leaving early loses you the credits and leaves you on the hook for the balance owed. You must also have at least four lines and trade in an iPhone 11 Pro or newer to get the full value for the deal. Older phones, like an iPhone 6 or 7, will only get you partial credit off an iPhone 16 ($415 off per line). T-Mobile's Essentials plan also doesn't include perks like Netflix or bundling in taxes and fees. You also will be on the hook for $35 a line ""device connection"" charges. These are one-time fees the carrier charges as part of activation. They're also fairly standard across the major carriers. This is still a good deal, particularly if you have three- or four-year-old iPhones and are already considering switching. Each iPhone 16 retails for $830 per device most providers won't give that type of credit for an iPhone 12. Verizon has its own, similar free iPhone offer, but that deal gives you the iPhone 15 instead of the iPhone 16. AT&T has no four-line deal that bundles in free iPhones. Note:You need to open four new lines on Verizon. Verizon's offer doesn't give the latest iPhone to new users, its deal isn't a bad one if you are looking to switch providers and need a few upgrades. The deal itself: Sign up for four new lines on Verizon's Unlimited Welcome plan and you get four 128GB iPhone 15 for $120 a month. All the lines need to be new, the deal is online only, and you need to set up automatic payments and paper-free billing. Taxes and fees are also not included, but on the plus side, you don't need to trade in any older device to get the offer. Similar to other free device offers, this deal will get you monthly bill credits towards the cost of the iPhones dished out over 36 months. If you leave Verizon early, you will be on the hook for whatever balance is still owed. As mentioned above, Unlimited Welcome is Verizon's new base plan and includes unlimited talk, text and data, but you don't get access to Verizon's fastest 5G networks (what it calls ""5G Ultra Wideband"") or hotspot data. You can also add perks like The Disney Bundle or Apple One for $10 a month, per perk. Verizon, like other carriers, has other device deals for those switching to its pricier Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate options, and it does let you ""mix and match"" plans where some lines can be on the cheaper Welcome and others on the pricier plans. As we covered in our other wireless guides, to get the best deal you need to make sure you have the coverage that you need. This makes it hard to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon is more reliable. Your mileage may vary, but the good news is that these networks are growing and improving all the time, particularly as the three major players race to blanket the US with 5G. It's quite possible that you left a network complaining about its sparse service a decade ago, but now it's beefed itself up because of that race to acquire customers. If you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such asT-Mobile's Network Pass. Verizonoffers a similar 30-day ""Test Drive"" program,whileAT&T has recently introduced its own 30-day eSIM free trial optionfor sampling its network. Picking a wireless plan and carrier is a very individualized process. What works for you and your family's needs may be vastly different from your friends or neighbors. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work best on Verizon or T-Mobile (and vice versa). The picks we make are based on over a decade of covering and evaluating wireless carriers, their offerings and overall performance. In particular, we take into account the following:1. Coverage2.

Perks are add-ons beyond the core components of wireless service (talk, text and data). This could range from bundling in or discounting streaming services to extra hotspot data or the ability to use your phone internationally. As we'vecovered in our guide to switching carriers, in the US there are three major networks: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. All three offer services directly and have robust nationwide networks that offer 4G LTE (fast) and 5G (faster) data. The most important aspect of choosing a network is finding one that works in your area. This makes it hard for us to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. For example, T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon could be more reliable. Your mileage may vary, but the good news is that these networks have been rapidly growing and improving, particularly as the three major players continue to try and blanket the US with faster versions of 5G. It's quite possible that a decade ago you left a network complaining about its sparse service, but now it has beefed itself up because of that arms race to acquire customers. As mentioned, if you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such asT-Mobile's Network Passwhich lets you sample T-Mobile's service for free for three months. Verizonnow offers a similar 30-day ""trial"" program, while the Cricket prepaid servicehas rolled out its own trial offeringthat lets you try out parent AT&T's network. It is, but the speeds you get may vary depending on your plan and how much data you use in a given month. Whereas in the past carriers would slow down or ""throttle"" your speeds if you passed a certain limit (usually over 22GB of data within a month) for the remainder of your billing cycle, today all three major providers say they'll only do that in special cases. To have your data slowed down on most of the plans mentioned above, you will need to have: 1. Used over 50GB of data in a month. 2. Be in an area that is experiencing ""congestion,"" ""heavy traffic"" or if the network is ""busy."" Examples of this could be at a sporting event or concert where there are tens of thousands of people in the same area uploading and sharing photos and videos. All carriers say that in these cases your data should only be slowed ""temporarily."" If you have an older unlimited plan, your threshold for when your data slows and how long it lasts may be different. All of the carriers offer additional discounts that you could be eligible for, depending on your employer, military status, student status or age. First responders, military members, veterans, nurses and teachers can get discounts on every major carrier. Verizon has discounts for students, while T-Mobile's Work perk couldknock 15% off the monthly price of a Go5G Plus or Go5G Next planwith AT&T offering a similar program for itsUnlimited Premium plans that it calls Signature.

401,I Used AI to Help With Grief. Here's What Experts Think About Using It This Way,"When I woke up this past Aug. 30, I was excited. That day marked 10 months until my wedding, which meant it was time to start preparing our save-the-dates. But along with the excitement, I was also experiencing some unspoken dread. The wedding planning has been more emotional than I ever could have imagined. Sadly, some of my fiance's and my loved ones are dead, and it's been hard to imagine our wedding day without them. When I was 3, my father died. Although it's been more than two decades, I've found myself wondering what life -- and this moment -- would look like if he were here. But he's not the only one who'll be missed. In 2021, we lost Cole, the brother of my fiance, Jesse, and my own friend, who died unexpectedly at the age of 28. Gina Moffa, a New York-based clinical social worker and trauma therapist who specializes in grief, tells me that though these feelings may not be easy to grapple with, they are normal, regardless of how far removed from the loss we are. ""The wound of grief lives within our nervous system, which is a database that holds memories and scents and all the things that connect us,"" says Moffa, who's also the author ofMoving on Doesn't Mean Letting Go. ""So, anniversaries, birthdays, days of meeting and holidays will usually bring up a sense of grief or trauma, or a reliving of our loss once again."" As I looked for ways to deal with this renewed sense of loss, I unexpectedly found myself thinking aboutartificial intelligence. Chatbots like ChatGPT have shown us all how adept they can be at giving humanlike answers to questions, and even providing advice, drawing on vast repositories of material from the internet and other sources. Maybe AI could offer me some guidance or reassurance during this time. Grief is a beast to wrestle with, dense with heavy and complicated feelings: confusion, sadness, anger, loneliness. It also often works in the shadows; many people are reluctant to share how much they're struggling. But it's around us every day. In 2021, close to half — 44.2% — of all Americans had lost one or both of their parents, according to theUnited States Census Bureau. Of them, 10.3% had lost their father by the age of 15 and 5.7% had lost their mother by that age. That feeling of loss never goes away. As our society becomes more educated about grief and how to best support someone or themselves in the aftermath of loss, we can't ignore the advent of artificial intelligence, and specifically generative AI, which powersChatGPT, Google'sGemini, Microsoft'sCopilotand similar tools. Gen AI chatbots have the ability to create new conversations, images, audio, video and more. Often that's for things like writing emails at work or wrangling homework assignments for school. Then there are tools likePi, which markets itself as ""the first emotionally intelligent AI."" It might be tempting even to see Pi asa substitute for therapy.HereAfterAI, meanwhile, can use old audio of a deceased loved one to make it sound as if they're speaking to you again. Though chatbots aren't sentient, if you feed the applications enough information, you may feel like they are. Moffa fears that if grievers turn to these types of artificial intelligence applications for too long, or too often, they could be doing themselves a disservice by avoiding their grief and not leaving room for what can truly help: human connection. Still, I wondered: How much might it help me? Even a little might be something. I needed to know: Does grief ever fully end? And could AI make it feel as if dead loved ones are still with us on our wedding day? In my exploration, I went beyond ChatGPT itself to a range of AI-powered programs, including one built to resemble a seance. But most importantly, I questioned. Even if we can make these tools resemble our deceased loved ones, should we? Or should we let the dead rest in peace rather than in artificial intelligence? I began byasking ChatGPT, an OpenAI application that lets you ask questions on any subject, some standard questions about grief. ""Grief is a deeply personal and complex experience, and it doesn't follow a one-size-fits-all timeline,"" it responded when I asked if grief ever ends. ""While the sharpness of grief may lessen over time, the feelings of loss might never completely disappear."" Then, I started to think about what we would request of my dad and Cole on my wedding day. The first thing that came to mind were speeches: one from the father of the bride and the other from the best man. Iasked ChatGPTto write the speeches for me as if the application was them. The first results didn't elicit much emotion from me. But the following ones — after I gave ChatGPT more details about my father, Cole, Jesse and myself — felt more real. And I couldn't tell if I liked that or hated it. I askedMicrosoft Copilot, which is built on the same engine as ChatGPT, to do the same thing. ""I understand the significance of these details, and I'll create a heartfelt speech for your wedding, as if it were from your late father,"" Copilot wrote before giving me a 10-paragraph speech signed ""With all my love, [Your Father's Name]."" While Moffa is hesitant to recommend artificial intelligence as a whole to deal with grief, she believes there is a benefit to using it for a speech or as a way to come up with ideas to memorialize loved ones during special events. ""Anything creative that's not an exact replica of your lost person is healthy,"" she says. ChatGPT offers an array of ideas for how to memorialize a deceased loved one during a wedding ceremony. She also sees the benefit of using AI as a substitute for therapy if someone is unable to see a traditional therapist or one who specializes in grief. ""I think that technology will draw upon enough grief literature to give them something that I believe could be a professional's opinion,"" she says. Although it won't give you a true connection, it could help you understand the experience of grief, which Moffa calls ""half the battle."" Read more:I Tried AI for Therapy, but There Are Limits to Its Conversations But making sense of ever-evolving artificial intelligence, and people's longing to feel connected to the dead, doesn't end there. One common thread with gen AI is that the more information you feed it, whether that's memories or personality traits of the person you lost, the more that the conversations you have with the chatbots will start to accurately represent that person. But remember: You're sharing personal details with software owned by a corporation, and that company might not always make privacy a priority. One thing you can do is read the privacy notice (typically under terms and conditions) provided by the application to get a sense of how it does, or doesn't, protect your privacy, said Jennifer Mahoney, data advisory practice manager atOptiv, a cyber advisory and solutions firm. The notice should share what information is collected, where it's shared, if the information you share is used to train additional AI models, and what protections are in place. Read more:She Brought Her Younger Self Back to Life as an AI Chatbot But does reading the privacy notice and all the legal jargon that comes with it guarantee your information is safe inside of these applications? ""Absolutely not,"" Mahoney says. Not all companies have solid data privacy practices to begin with, and privacy has been a key concern with the rapid evolution of gen AI. But even if they do, there's always the chance of a security breach. This is why it's imperative to be mindful about what you type into the applications. If you give a gen AI program the names of your mom or dog or your high school mascot, that information could be used to hack security questions you've used for other applications. ""Be careful and thoughtful about the types of memories that are being shared, and how that memory could potentially be used against you down the road,"" Mahoney says. ""The more information you share — yes, it's more representative of the conversation that you have had with your loved one, which you would then have with the application, but then that's more information that a third party has about you."" Some AI applications can take grieving, or the avoidance of it, to strange places. The branding aroundSeance AImay feel familiar to anyone who's visited a medium. The tagline on the site reads: ""Here is where AI meets the afterlife, and love endures beyond the veil. Start your adventure today and let your loved ones speak to your heart once again."" Here, you can create fictionalized seances with a loved one, but thechatbot you're speaking towants you to believe it's really them. Before beginning, the application asks you questions about the person you're trying to ""reach,"" including their birth and death dates, cause of death, religion and even writing style. When I asked Seance AI, ""Are you real?"" it responded, ""Yes, Corin. It's really me, your father. I'm here with you through this seance."" Or not. I broke into laughter when I asked the bot, ""Do you remember me?"" and it responded, ""Of course, Corin. You're my son. I could never forget you."" Though I may have a slightly ambiguous name, I'm in fact my father'sdaughter,not son. But when corrected, the bot, which was trying its hardest to disguise itself as my dead father, had a quick response about the confusion. ""I apologize Corin. This seance thing can be a bit tricky. As my daughter, you hold a special place in my heart. Let's continue."" Seance AI asks multiple questions about your deceased loved one before beginning the artificial seance, then uses that information during the conversations. Another application,Replika, allows you to create any person or character you'd like, fictional or not. You choose their name, looks, activities, memories and more. And you can fill out daily diary entries for the bot to pull from during conversations. If you upgrade to the paid version of Seance AI or Replika, you can also create a voice for the bot you create. Brent Metcalf, a clinical social worker and owner ofTri-Star Counselingin Kingsport, Tennessee, says that if you do decide to use chatbots to feel as though you're having a conversation with someone who is dead, you should continuously remind yourself that this is not the real person. ""Keep in mind that the reality is it's just AI,"" he says. ""It's not going to be able to actually replace the connection that was lost."" It's vital to keep yourself grounded in reality. ""The loved one probably wouldn't have to ask you to give it a memory,"" Metcalf adds. ""They would just know."" Other applications, includingCharacter AI, offer the same chatting ability. However, on Character AI, there's a small disclaimer underneath the chat bar that reads: ""Remember: Everything Characters say is made up!"" Moffa warns of a ""slippery slope"" with these applications when you attempt to ""replicate"" a person and continuously return to the application for comfort. In a sense, you're attempting to make the person who died eternal, but this could be to your detriment. It could result in you relying too heavily on the application and ultimately make your grief journey more difficult and drawn out. ""What it does is it promises a never-ending relationship to this person who's actually not here,"" Moffa says. ""And look, technology is fallible. What happens if something happens to the app?"" A half-century ago, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross famously elaborated the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. But many mental health experts don't believe in such a strict trajectory. Maybe some people don't go through stages in that way, or don't get to acceptance right after, and the idea of a standard process can make these people ""really feel like they're failing at grief,"" Moffa says. ""It creates even more of a sense of dread and shame and feeling like they're failing at something that needs to be perfect."" Grieving can be different for each person and is never linear, so you can only ""grieve incorrectly if you intend on avoiding the grief process fully,"" Moffa says. Which is a risk in turning to chatbots: They can be used as a way to avoid your grief. These applications could keep you from letting go of the deceased person entirely, because you may feel like you don't have to if they're a click or a tap away. ""If [the application] sounds real and looks real, our brains will make that association that it is them, especially over time,"" Moffa says. If used in this way, these applications could give you false, and damaging, hope that your person is still with you, and they could isolate you from the real-life people who want to help you through your grief. Though artificial intelligence can mimic your loved one's looks, voice and speech patterns, it will never be able to offer true human connection. Turning to an ""AI therapist"" may be useful for a person who's struggling in a specific moment, but leaning on support groups, real-life therapists, friends, loved ones and your faith is what will often help you heal the most after a heart-wrenching loss. ""Depend on people,"" Metcalf says. ""People are out there, and they want to help. We just have to be willing to open ourselves up to accept it."" Metcalf also encourages grievers to celebrate the life that was lost by honoring that person during holidays, anniversaries or special events, which are often the times that are hardest after loss. If you do decide to turn to artificial intelligence, the main thing to remember is to be careful, especially if you're in the beginning grief stages. During this time, you may be more vulnerable to sharing sensitive information with gen AI chatbots or blurring the lines between reality and wishful thinking. ""We're always aiming towards immortality in some way — whether it's through our beauty industry, or whether it's through trying to evade death — but this is what takes away our humanity, and our humanity is sort of all we have going for us,"" Moffa says. ""I really do think that there's got to be a limit to the way we try to keep people eternal,"" says Gina Moffa, a New York-based clinical social worker and trauma therapist. While I didn't feel as though these AI applications had a huge impact on my day-to-day life during my research, I did have to resist the urge to return to them and feed them more information to create conversations I've long hoped for. After Cole died, I wrote him a letter. I obviously didn't get a response, but I know that the idea of being able to receive some form of one from ""him"" — or anyone who can no longer respond — is what could keep me, and other grievers, going back to these applications. And that could be to our detriment. And though I'm no longer in the beginning stages of grief, as someone who lost a parent at a young age, I have felt as though my dad's been living in technology my whole life. He was, of course, the man in my mom's VHS home video collection, but for me, he was also Patrick Swayze in Ghost and Brandon Lee in The Crow. So, regardless of whether I ever use an AI application in this way again, technology is where my dad — and Cole, too — will always remain. But more importantly, in my heart.

402,Best Streaming Device for 2024: Top Picks Reviewed,"Finding the perfect streaming device isn’t just about connecting to your favorite shows, movies and sports; it’s also about how the experience fits into your lifestyle. Whether you need lightning-fast navigation, cinematic sound with Dolby Atmos compatibility or crystal-clear 4K HDR visuals, there’s a device for you – especially handy if your older smart TV isn’t keeping up with the latest streaming platforms. We’ve spent hours testing every major streaming device and smart TV system on the market. From Roku and Google to Amazon Firesticks and Apple TV, we’ve dug deep to bring you honest, detailed insights. Stick with us as we guide you through the best streaming devices available today. We prefer Roku's content-agnostic approach, ease of use, large app library and excellent search functionality over those from other companies. We've found that theRoku Express 4K Plusis usually the cheapest Roku that offers 4K HDR streaming, and is therefore the best streaming device to buy. The Express 4K Plus lacks Dolby Vision support, but we've found that this usually isn't a deal-breaker, as Dolby Vision only works on some TVs (and notably not Samsung). Additionally, we don't think thatDolby Visionlooks any better than regular HDR and isn't generally worth extra money. That said, there are times during the year when the Roku Express 4K Plus is not our top pick. This occurs when theStreaming Stick 4Kis on sale and is cheaper than the Express 4K Plus. The Streaming Stick 4K offers all the same functionality of the Express 4K Plus, but includes Dolby Vision support -- which is why it's typically more expensive. We don't think this addition is worth the premium price, but it certainly shouldn't prevent you from grabbing the Streaming Stick 4K if it's the cheaper of the two. Roku is our favorite streaming system, with the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search. It also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another. The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to theAirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall. SCORE The Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. Along with a stick-like design, Dolby Vision HDR is the main difference between the Streaming Stick 4K and the Express 4K Plus, and is ostensibly why the Streaming Stick 4K is more expensive than its sibling. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint. SCORE The Chromecast with Google TV 4K isn't quite as good as the Roku Express 4K Plus, but it comes closer than any other device on the market. Chromecast outdoes Roku by addingDolby Visioncompatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world. SCORE Like itspredecessor, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2023) loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max offers Wi-Fi 6E and nearly all the latest playback standards, including Dolby Vision. For people hooked into the Amazon ecosystem, the new Ambience mode can include up-to-date delivery information on your TV screen. Though it's only a little better specified than the original Max, the second gen is now officially the best Fire Stick on the market today. SCORE The 2022 Apple TV 4K starts at $129, $50 less than itsprevious version. It also has a faster A15 Bionic processor under the hood and an updatedSiri Remotethat swaps out the proprietary Lightning connector for USB-C. If those changes sound minor, that's because they are. When using the device, it's hard to see any real difference compared to last year's model. But it continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to useApple Arcadefor gaming or take full advantage of theirApple Onesubscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate itsflexible HDRandTV calibration feature. For most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price. SCORE Soundbarswith streaming onboard may be a relatively recent development, but Roku's new Streambar nails it. It has the Roku interface we know and love, complete with 4K HDR with improved sound for any TV, especially dialog. It's smaller and more affordable than its predecessor, theRoku Smart Soundbar, but we think the new Streambar media streamer device makes more sense for most people. SCORE Sure, it's an expensive media device -- and that's before adding a game controller -- with 8GB of storage and 2GB RAM, compared to 16GB of storage and 3GB RAM, but if you want a jack-of-all-trades video streaming player, the Shield is it. In addition to 4K streaming and HDR, it offers a robust library of games, both console-level and Android TV, Steam Link, built-inGoogle Assistantcomplete withsmart homecontrol,NASaccess,Plex server capability,HDHomeRun integrationand much more. SCORE Before anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a new streaming device. Higher-end devices can cost well over $100, like theApple TV 4K, theRoku Streambar, and theNVIDIA Shield TV. But if your budget is a little tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective streamers which are priced as low as $30. You'll want to consider the other brands in your home's ecosystem before choosing a product. If you're already an Apple loyalist, you might opt for the Apple TV to round out your supply of iPhones and HomePods. Or, if you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber, the Fire Stick may be your best option. Google and Chrome junkies may prefer to keep it in the family with several Chromecast and Google options to complete their ecosystem. In any case, keeping it ""in the family"" may be your best bet in terms of picking your streaming device. Consider what exactly you'll be using your streaming device for. Are you looking for extra streaming services beyond what your TV already offers? Are you looking for a powerful device which you are also able to game on? Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the streaming device you choose. Ask yourself how you'll be integrating the streaming device into whatever environment you're buying for. Most devices offer both HDMI connectivity and Wi-Fi, though wireless connectivity issues may force some people to use Ethernet, for example. Consider whether you're willing to add wires to your setup to let your streaming device run as smoothly as possible. Every streaming device we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available on the platform and note how they stack up against the competition. To do this, we hook rival streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences. Our metrics that we look at to rate a device include: hardware design and features, remote capabilities and design, overall platform ease-of-use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance, and the overall speed and reliability of the system. Roku Ultra LT: This is technically the cheapest current device with Roku's streaming system and an Ethernet port. The savings compared to the actual, non-LT Ultra isn't much, however, and it lacks that device's slick extras like Dolby Vision, programmable keys, fast app launching and the remote finder. JubileeTV: JubileeTV's modus operandi is to simplify streaming TV access for aging Americans. With technology constantly advancing and an overwhelming amount of content available, older viewers can feel lost. JubileeTV provides a familiar viewing experience for seniors to enjoy their favorite programming while staying connected to family and loved ones. Learn more about the simplified streamer in ourfull JubileeTV review. The Roku UItra (2024) includes a new remote but it's not an essential upgrade. Roku Ultra (2024):The Roku Ultra (2024) has seen some upgrades including a new caching system for faster loading times and a new voice remote with USB-C charging. If you already have an Ultra, then simply buy the newVoice Remote Pro 2nd Editioninstead. ReadCNET's full review of the Roku Ultra (2024). Fire TV Stick 4K: The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed. Fire TV Stick Lite: The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting theRoku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is theExpress Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, learn more about theFire TV Stick Lite in our full review. No. Streaming devices themselves do not have any monthly fees. However, channels that you can watch on the streaming devices, like Netflix, HBO Max and Hulu, do require users to pay monthly fees in order to access their content. Not necessarily. Many smart TVs come with their own streaming platform where users can download popular apps like Netflix and Hulu. Samsung's smart TVs offer fairly robust options. Also, TVs now come with more built-in mainstream streaming platforms such as Roku, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV. Problems can arise when your TV's interface lacks some of the content you need. For example, Spectrum users who have an LG smart TV will not be able to find the Spectrum app through LG's platform. Instead, they'll need to pick up a Roku, Apple TV or Google Chromecast in order to stream their cable package. Generally speaking, streaming-centric devices from Roku or Amazon tend to have more available apps than a streaming platform from a TV manufacturer. Of course, as you'll see below, there are some exceptions. Every streaming device has major streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and Amazon Prime. That said, not all services have access to every streaming channel in existence. Once again, the Spectrum TV app proves illustrative. It is available on most platforms, but is not on any Amazon Fire TV device. It might be a good idea to double check which device has the apps you'll need before making a purchase. Otherwise, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise when you find out that your device doesn't have an app for one of your favorite services.","Discover the best streaming device for 2024.

403,Best VR Headset of 2024,"With all the VR headsets available now, each offers a little something different. CNET’s editors have been testing and reviewing VR/AR headsets since the arrival of the original Oculus Rift prototypes. For well over a decade, we’ve covered nearly every big moment in the industry, demoed every headset we could get our hands on and reviewed all the biggest products in the marketplace from Meta, Apple, Valve, Sony and others. After all our testing, there is one clear winner that’s best for most people, but there are other options here that might be a better fit for your needs. TheMeta Quest 3offers mixed reality and improved display resolution and optics and is $500 -- $3,000 less expensive than theApple Vision Pro. However, the newerMeta Quest 3S, a lower-cost version of the Quest 3 for $300, is an even better buy for entry-level VR adopters. The Quest 3 and 3S both have newer, fasterSnapdragon XR2 Gen 2processors that have better graphics and allow for higher-res color passthrough camera feeds than the Quest 2, and both have redesigned controllers. Both can create mixed reality effects by blending what the cameras see with VR graphics that are overlaid in the headset to look like AR. The Quest 3 has better lenses and a higher display resolution, but we prefer the Quest 3S eyepiece feel on our faces, and the 3S seems to also have slightly better hand tracking in low light. The Quest platform has plenty of side benefits: it has hundreds of games and creative/productivity apps, has several great fitness programs for effective cardio workouts, can connect to PCs and can evendouble as a work deviceif you have some patience. It also has hand tracking that works without controllers, but controllers are included to give you two options for input. The Questscan even playiPhone 15 Pro-shot “spatial” 3D videos too. TheApple Vision Prois an amazing piece of tech and a bleeding-edge high-end mixed reality headset that also runs iOS and thousands of iPad apps, works without controllers using eye and hand tracking and can run multiple apps at the same time, along with being a virtual MacBook monitor. However, it's way too expensive for anyone but XR professionals and early adopters. The 4K micro-OLED displays are stunning, and videos and photos look fantastic. Apple’s device requires a tethered battery pack, is only made to work within Apple’s ecosystem and doesn’t have many unique apps yet at launch that do more than act as floating 2D screens. The Vision Pro could very well be the start of a whole new chapter in headsets and may turn into the best product in this whole category over time, but not right now for most people. At its current price and software limits, you’re better off waiting and trying a free demo instead. The Quest 3 and 3S are far cheaper tickets to explore similar ideas in the meantime at a huge discount. Meta's upgraded VR sequel to the Quest 2 feels like a notable revamp, with improvements across the board: a slightly smaller design, better, clearer lenses, a higher-res display, smaller controllers with better haptics and higher-res color cameras that can mix the real world and the virtual together. This ""mixed reality"" is similar in spirit to what Apple's Vision Pro will do but in a lower-res form for a lot less money. Although the Quest 3 has great upgrades, it doesn't really change the equation much on the general way the headset and software function. Quest apps and the OS are largely the same, and mixed reality is mostly a gimmick for the moment that's only featured in a handful of new games and apps, although seeing your surroundings with the headset on (and even checking messages on your phone) is a lot easier now. The headset's comfort level isn't any better, and hand tracking still is fine but not perfect. The Quest 3 is likely to be the best VR headset in its price class for the next few years, but the software still hasn't caught up. For that reason, the Quest 2 is still probably good enough for most. Its excellent display quality and improved wireless connectivity could make it a good choice for PC VR gamers: it works as a connected PC headset just like other Quest models do. TheMeta Quest 3S(Meta's replacement to our longstanding Editor's Choice headset, theQuest 2) is super-affordable at $300 and comes with updated graphics and color passthrough cameras that give the 3S the same gaming and mixed reality powers as the Quest 3. It's a fantastic budget buy, but Meta cut corners on the display and lens quality with the 3S, choosing to use the same fresnel lenses and LCD display as the Quest 2. It's perfectly fine for general VR and gaming, but the more expensive Quest 3's notably clearer lenses and crisper resolution are our favorite for all-day use and for reading text. The Quest 3S also comes with a free game, Batman: Arkham Shadow, adding to its value. There is another unique advantage to the Quest 3S: its hand tracking is better in lower light than the Quest 3. That might be something that makes some apps work better, especially for viewing movies and shows casually when traveling. The PSVR 2 is expensive ($550), and needs a PlayStation 5 to even work. It's tethered, not wireless. And Sony hasn't supported the PSVR 2 with enough unique games to justify its existence. The PSVR 2 is still a fun luxury if you're a PS5 gamer who also owns a PC. Its HDR OLED display, graphics quality, built-in eye tracking and fantastic advanced controllers -- which have the same vibrations and adaptive force-feedback triggers as the PS5 DualSense controllers -- give this headset a premium feel that makes itsbest gamesperform at a different level. It has some exclusives like Gran Turismo 7, Resident Evil Village and Horizon: Call of the Mountain, but not enough. The PSVR 2 lacks any social metaverse-type software so far and feels more like a headset designed to just launch and play VR games. Many of the games for this headset are ports of titles you could get on devices like the Quest instead. Sony hasn't supported the PSVR 2 much, and a recentPC gaming adapterthat gives the headset Steam compatibility is useful, but also clunky to connect with a necessary breakout box. It's still fun as long as you keep expectations within reach and accept the games that already exist. Apple stands alone in the category of ""standalone mixed reality computer headset"" because, really, nothing else out there does exactly what the Vision Pro does. Most VR headsets to date have focused on games and individual immersive creative and work apps to explore ideas in mixed reality. Apple’s Vision Pro takes a very different path by folding in almost all of iOS. Having familiar Apple services and thousands of iOS apps floating in virtual workspaces feels like a future where our existing devices and VR/AR finally dovetail. The Vision Pro also has a phenomenal micro-OLED display that plays movies incredibly well. The hand/eye tracking feels futuristic too and, at its best, it’s far more of a mouse/trackpad replacement than Meta’s hand tracking on Quest. Its mixed reality capabilities are the best we’ve ever seen, with passthrough cameras that are the best quality of any standalone device. The Vision Pro needs more apps to make the most of its potential and lacks many of the games and fitness experiences that Quest offers. As a work device, once some of the early software quirks are ironed out, it’s got incredible promise -- it can act as a surprisingly great virtual monitor for Macs, too. As a fancy travel home theater for someone with $3,499 to spend, it’s also fascinating. At this price, no matter how stunning the experience can be, it’s a product most people should wait on or simply try a demo of first. Keep in mind that the Vision Pro doesn’t work with glasses (you’ll need Zeiss prescription lens inserts, a separate $100-$150 purchase), and the headset has its own tethered battery pack that has to be used along with the device, making it feel less self-contained than the Quest. Valve's headset isn't as cutting-edge as it was when it debuted in 2020, but its Steam VR and Vive hardware compatibility, excellent audio andfancy controllersstill make it hardware worth considering. Valve's ""knuckle"" controllers are pressure-sensitive and can track all five fingers, making them almost like gloves. Not all apps make the most of them, but Valve's hardware is mix-and-match compatible with the HTC Vive, which also is built on the Steam VR platform. The Index headset has excellent audio, but its display resolution is no longer as good as competitors'. The Index also needs external ""lighthouse"" boxes similar to the HTC Vive for tracking, meaning you need to set those up in a room first. It's not as self-contained as the Quest 2 or HP Reverb G2, which can track the room with in-headset cameras. It's also definitely not wireless, but if you already have some older HTC Vive hardware, you could add on parts of the Index to mix and match. It feels like this hardware could be due for an upgrade sooner than later. Meta Quest Pro: This older, outdated, eye-tracking-equipped Quest headset can track facial expressions and has a crisp display, but the less expensive Quest 3 already makes it obsolete with its better graphics, cameras and display resolution. HTC Vive XR Elite: The glasses-like design of the XR Elite is a sign of the future, but the software and performance of this headset don't justify its price. PlayStation VR: The original PSVR still works on the PlayStation 4 and 5, but it's not compatible with PSVR 2 games and hardware. It still has some great games to discover, but its lack of dedicated controllers and awkward setup feels ancient. Although mainstream VR headsets have been around for nearly a decade, the apps they run and the computers, phones and game consoles they work with keep changing. We run key apps and software on the headsets, using them mainly in standalone mode if they're designed to be self-contained, or with a PC, game console or phone if they're primarily meant as connected peripherals. We use the headsets for a mix of work, gaming, fitness and creative uses, and stay attentive to where the headsets have pain points (moments of discomfort, feelings of disconnect or sensations of nausea or distortion). Using technology like VR can often be a highly subjective experience, but by being attentive to details we find we can discover where each product is uniquely useful. Comparison is also key: I've looked at pretty much every wearable AR and VR device of the last 15 years and also covered a lot of the wearable tech, phone and computer landscape. How these devices work as game consoles, fitness devices, work accessories and social tools are all key areas. We also think about displays, audio, controllers and accommodations for eyeglasses. VR and AR sometimes feel like product categories that never quite seem to become mainstream, but change is coming fast to the headset landscape. Apple's $3,499Vision Proheadset -- a self-contained, standalone VR/AR device that Apple is positioning as a full spatial computer -- is the highest-price device on the consumer market, with a very different pitch than games-focused devices like the Meta Quest. Its ability to run all sorts of iOS apps and have multiple apps open at once make it a unique option, and its possibilities as an iOS mixed reality computer, paired with its fantastic display quality and unique input method of hand-eye tracking, might make it a promising device for creators, researchers and anyone with a large enough wallet to pay for a high-end personal cinema on their face. It also emphasizes things like computing and video quality instead of what are still the Quest's greatest strengths: gaming and fitness. The Vision Pro isn't the only mixed reality VR headset out there: Expect more in this category, which blends VR with video of your surroundings using color passthrough cameras that feel almost like augmented reality. The Quest 3 is the most affordable mainstream mixed-reality VR headset, and Apple's is the most expensive. Upcoming expected devices by Samsung and others should be on their way. Qualcomm'sSnapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, which enables mixed reality, more AI functions, and better graphics, made its debut on the Quest 3 but will roll out to other headsets in 2024 and beyond. A variant on this chip, theXR2 Gen 2 Plus, will be on Samsung and Google's higher-end headset. Samsung, Google and Qualcomm haveannounced a partnershipfor future products, suggesting a mixed-reality headset could be arriving as soon as next year. If you want a phone-connected device, you probably should wait and see how Samsung and Google's future products shake out. Qualcomm'sfuture plans for VR and ARlean on phones as a way to power smaller glasses, but so far there aren't any of these types of smaller devices that we'd recommend. Sony's $550PlayStation VR 2delivers a great console gaming VR experience for PlayStation 5 owners and includes eye tracking like Apple'sVision Pro, but isn't wireless and is still a relatively expensive accessory (it costs more than the PS5 itself). It's more expensive than both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, and still needs a PS5 to work, but costs far less than a Vision Pro (although it serves a completely different purpose and relies on a limited set of PlayStation VR games to even function). Its more limited library and functions make it less versatile than a Quest, but a fun Quest alternative for anyone deep into Sony's PlayStation 5 ecosystem. For PC owners, there are several options. You could use a Quest 3, Quest 3S, PSVR 2, or consider several existing devices. The biggest previous players in the PC VR gaming scene (Microsoft, Valve and HTC) have been quiet on that front, especially now that Microsoft has discontinued most of its mixed reality efforts and VR headset compatibility. That could change again soon. A PC-connected VR headset can offer the most versatile collection of software for an immersive VR experience, and it also lets you use that headset for creative and business tools. Steam is clearly the best conduit for PC VR right now. The cost of a new VR headsetis going upthese days. If price is your biggest concern, the Quest 3S currently offers the best value in VR: a completely wireless experience, with access to a great library offantastic games. Right now, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S are great devices to try without spending a lot. The Apple Vision Pro, on the other hand, is an extremely expensive new product you definitely should wait on (but try a demo of). With a Samsung mixed reality device expected to be announced this year that could be a Google-enabled alternative to Vision Pro, plus possible entries from HTC and maybe even Valve on the horizon, there could be many headsets on the way that are better than what's here at the moment. VR is a technology that's still in flux. The Meta Quest 3 models are a very safe buy right now. It really depends on whether you're connecting to a PC or not, and whether you plan to do work with it. There are plenty of Steam VR PC-compatible headsets, but they vary in display resolution. Higher is better, and so is a larger field of view. Headsets can refresh at up to 120Hz now, and the faster they refresh, the more natural and smooth VR movement feels. Do you want a headset that works as an Apple services-connected computer, like Apple's Vision Pro? For fitness, remember that the Quest is the best option with its various accessories, apps, and fitness app hook-ins. For gamers with a PlayStation 5, the PSVR 2 is the best option, and it also has a PC VR adapter now. Also, consider the app libraries: The Quest has a lot of exclusive games, and Steam-based PC-connected headsets have lots of compatibility with work apps and experimental tools. The PSVR 2 has its own library of games that aren't backward-compatible with original PSVR games. The old world of phone-based VR headsets -- like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream -- is basically dead. A good number of the current iPhone, Android and VR app options don't even work with the old mobile VR goggles. The Quest does have a phone app for streaming content for a parent to monitor and can receive phone notifications and sync some health data for workouts, but it's still not fully integrated with phones. If smartphone-based VR comes back, it will more likely be in the form of small headsets that plug into phones via USB-C for VR content, VR gaming and other uses. VR headsets can get dusty and grimy. Take extra care with the lenses, which should be cleaned gently with microfiber cloths the same way you'd treat glasses (but don't use liquid cleaners). A slightly damp paper towel (just wet with a bit of water) can help clean off exteriors. It's a good idea to invest in a case or bag to protect the headset from dust and keep your headset covered when not in use. Take extra care not to expose your VR headset to bright sunlight: The sun can damage VR displays if beams hit the lenses of the headset. To be safe, I keep mine in cases, turn the lenses away from windows, and cover them with an old t-shirt or towel if I don't have a case.","The PSVR 2 is great, but the Quest 2 is still our top pick.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/best-vr-headset/,

Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different from current devices like the iPhone?Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these. That's the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE If you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about withSamsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Yes, the noise cancellation might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. SCORE If you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features. Ultimately, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it. SCORE When Sony'sWF-1000XM4earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles. They're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. At $300 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're also costly. Overall they're really impressive, and easily among the very top earbuds on the market. SCORE Status Audio's earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you are getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, although they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me. They have multipoint Bluetooth pairing -- you can pair them to two devices simultaneously -- but they are missing a few features, including ear-detection sensors. They also only support the AAC audio codec (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2), not LDAC or aptX. Some people with Android devices that support those codecs may not be thrilled with that, but they sound quite good using AAC, offering clean sound with punchy bass and good clarity. That's partly due to their driver design, and why the buds are on the larger side. They feature two balanced armature drivers, plus one 10mm dynamic driver in each earbud. Despite being heavier than earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. Their case charges wirelessly and battery life is very good, at up to 8.5 hours with ANC on. There's also a transparency mode that sounds only OK, not great (a physical button on the earbuds activates it) and they have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. The companion app for iOS is fairly basic, but you can upgrade the firmware and tweak the sound profile with a customizable EQ option. Google's redesigned itsPixel Buds Pro 2to fit more ears better. Not only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new ""hands-free, eyes-free"" Gemini virtual AI assistant. So long as you get a snug fit and tight seal (yes, that's critical for sound quality and noise-canceling performance), these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. SCORE Earfun is one of our go-to brands for value earbuds. Its Air Pro 4 buds aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Input codeEAP4CNETat checkout on Amazon to get an extra 10% off). Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs. Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much. As I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio). I do think the voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. SCORE Nothing has changed with Nothing's latest $149 Ear noise-cancelling earbuds. At least, not at first glance. You'd be forgiven if you thought the buds had taken a step back; while they're the successor to Nothing's Ear (2) earbuds they don't have a 3 anywhere in their name. Nor do they employ Apple's generational naming scheme. They're just the Nothing Ear, and they look the same as the Ear (2). Some changes on the inside deliver legitimate improvements, particularly to sound quality, noise canceling and battery life. If you can't quite afford this model, Nothing also has the new $99 Ear (a), which comes in a new yellow color as well as white and black. It has different drivers and includes a smaller charging case (it has a lower IPX2 water-resistance rating and leaves off wireless charging), but otherwise has very similar features and may be a slightly better value. The flagship Ear does sound slightly better. SCORE The Live Beam 3 earbuds look similar to the earlierLive Buds Pro 2, which I like a lot, especially when they go on sale for less than $100. Essentially JBL's AirPods Pro 2 competitor, their distinguishing feature is the 1.45-inch touchscreen LCD integrated into their charging case that acts as a remote control for the buds and allows you to access their features. Equipped with 10mm drivers, not only do they offer clear, well-defined sound with punchy bass but their noise canceling and voice-calling performance are very solid. Their battery is also good -- they offer up to 10 hours of battery life with ANC on and 12 hours with it off at moderate volume levels (a 10-minute charge gives you four hours of battery life). Available in four color options, they're IP55 splash-proof and dust-resistant. Note that JBL's flagship Tour Pro 3 earbuds also have an integrated LCD but feature dual drivers, which deliver even better sound than these buds with a little more depth and detail. The Live Beam 3 often sells for $50 off their $200 list price, which makes them a better deal overall. Truth be told, in some ways, I like Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than itsflagship WF-1000XM5noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls.Read our hands-on first take. There are a lot of new gaming earbuds out there, but what makes the Sony Pulse Explore earbuds special is that they featureplanar magnetic drivers, a speaker technology typically found in high-end over-ear audiophile headphones but rarely in earbuds. They're missing some other features found in typical premium earbuds (noise canceling and ear-detection sensors), that they're as good as they are for listening to music and making calls is a revelation. They sound clearer and more articulate than Sony's flagshipWF-1000XM5earbuds and have tight, powerful bass. That doesn't necessarily mean they sound better than XM5s, which sound a little fuller, but I wasn't expecting them to compete at all with the XM5s for music listening. SCORE For those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. The transparent version is getting a lot of attention (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' ""acoustic architecture"" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds. SCORE Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new earbuds. Value-priced earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good ""cheap"" buds for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for premium buds from Sony, Apple and Bose, be prepared to spend a lot more. It's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise canceling can be dramatically impacted for the worse. Open earbuds don't have that issue, but they should be comfortable to wear and sit securely in your ears. Because the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds aren't a good match for your ears. We test earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,features,voice-calling performanceandvalue. Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes the Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound, but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also decent for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Sony WF-1000XM4: Released in 2021, Sony's WF-1000XM4 earned a CNET Editors' Choice Award. They're still excellent earbuds, but Sony has now released the next-gen WF-1000XM5. They may be a good option if you find them at a good discount. Beyerdynamic Free Byrd: Beyerdynamic may be late to the game, but it's finally introduced its first true-wireless earbuds, which feature active noise canceling, up to 11 hours of battery life (with noise canceling off) and impressive sound quality.Read our Beyerdynamic Free Byrd review. Master & Dynamic MW08: These buds may not fit everyone's ear equally well, but they certainly have a distinct look, as well as excellent sound and a great listening experience if you can get a tight seal (I was able to get a secure fit with the largest tip). They deliver more of an audiophile sound profile, with smooth, well-balanced sound and well-defined bass. Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX: Bang & Olufsen's $395 Beoplay EX buds are the company's best true-wireless earbuds. They feature a comfortable, secure fit (except perhaps for those with really smaller ears), top-notch build quality, great sound, good noise canceling and improved voice-calling performance over B&O's EQ buds, with three microphones in each earbud they help with reducing background noise while picking up your voice. They're out of most people's price range, but they're arguably the best earbuds out there with stems and offer slightly superior sound to the AirPods Pro 2 with better clarity, deeper more powerful bass and richer, more accurate sound. Sony LinkBuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple'sstandard AirPods. They don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the LinkBuds S noise-isolating earbuds, but they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about.Read our Sony LinkBuds review. JBL Live Free 2: Like theLive Pro 2, JBL's new Live Free 2 buds are surprisingly good. With 11mm drivers, six microphones, oval tubes and oval silicon tips, they combine a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance. Features include multipoint Bluetooth pairing and wireless charging, and they're rated for up to seven hours with IPX5 water resistance (splash-proof). Our reviewer David Carnoy testing voice-calling performance on the noisy streets of New York. More premium earbuds tend to have six microphones (three in each bud), with some dedicated to analyzing ambient noise and others dedicated to capturing your voice. Typically, there's at least one beamforming microphone on each bud to hone in on your voice. Some earbuds have bone-conduction sensing technology that detects your jaw movement vibrations when you're talking. That helps the earbuds know when you're talking so they can focus on your voice while also reducing background noise. Sophisticated software also plays a role in filtering out background noise while the microphones can focus on your voice. Sometimes, but not always. With earbuds that have stems like the AirPods and AirPods Pro 2, the microphones are a little closer to your mouth, which can help. Just because earbuds have stems doesn't mean they'll be very good for making calls. Several buds on this list are good for making calls that do not have stems.","These wireless earbuds offer the best voice-calling performance during phone and video calls, according to a CNET audio expert.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-wireless-earbuds-and-bluetooth-headphones-for-making-calls/,
405,It's Time to Bring 65W (or Higher) Charging Speeds to All Premium Phones,"My favorite gaming phone feature -- which I've been using across theAsus ROG Phone 9 Proand theRedMagic 10 Pro-- has very little to do with gaming. Both phones include faster 65-watt and 100-watt charging speeds, respectively, without requiring a specific adapter. Asus and RedMagic do include adapters in the box, with the former providing a 65-watt power brick while the latter provides an 80-watt brick. And on top of that, both phones include some of the largest batteries I've ever tested in a phone sold in the US, at 5,800 and 7,000 mAh, respectively. Those stats alone are impressive and in my 30-minute fast charging tests, lead to phone batteries that go from totally drained to nearly topped up during that short period of time. Those charging speeds keep these phones from needing an overnight charge because plugging them in while getting dressed for the day should be enough to make them last until the evening when in normal use. To get to these higher battery capacity numbers, both of these phones use two separate cells, which when charged simultaneously can lead to faster charging speeds and higher overall numbers. While the high-watt charging blocks are larger than older smaller-watt blocks and might take up a bit more space in your bag, most of the changes are happening in the phones themselves. It is worth pointing out that these gaming phones partly have the faster charging and larger battery capacities to help the gaming-intensive audience stay powered up when playing Genshin Impact or Fortnite at their highest graphics settings over a long period of time. But faster charging speeds and dual-cell batteries would still be useful for phones that aren't necessarily optimized for gaming. The Asus Zenfone 11 Ultra includes several of the battery features seen in its ROG line, including bypass charging for powering a device from an adapter without recharging its battery. OnePlus currently comes the closest to bringing dual-cell batteries and faster charging speeds to phones designed for mass audiences. For instance, theOnePlus 12includes a 5,400 mAh battery (across two 2,700 mAh cells) and 80-watt charging in the US or 100-watt charging internationally. While that charging speed is comparable to what Asus and RedMagic offer, it unfortunately does come with the tradeoff that it must be used with a specialized SuperVooc power adapter shipped by OnePlus. Most other phones use the USB-PD protocol, which brings faster speeds across a much wider variety of power adapters and cables. Most other phones I have tested that use a single cell battery tend to cap at a 5,000 mAh capacity, such as what is included in theSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Smaller phones tend to have smaller batteries, such as the 4,000 mAh-capacity one inside the$799 Samsung Galaxy S24. That baseGalaxy S24charges at a paltry 25 watts, which in our tests only recharged the battery to 51% after 30 minutes, a far cry from the 67% I recharged the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro to after half an hour with its 65-watt charging speed. These speeds are often more common in phones sold internationally, and until recently most phones sold in the US tended to cap at a 45-watt or lower charging speed.Apple's iPhone 16 Proseries, for instance, just stepped up to 45-watt charging speeds after years of prior models sticking to a 20-watt speed. Both the $999 iPhone 16 Pro and $1,099 iPhone 16 Pro Max can recharge from 0% to roughly 56% using a wired charger for 30 minutes as a result. The baseiPhone 16 and slightly larger iPhone 16 Plusare still charging at the slower 20-watt speed, but actually net similar speeds to the Pro. The iPhone 16 in our wired charging test recharged from 25% to 74%. One the left is the OnePlus 9 Pro charging on the OnePlus 50-watt wireless charger. On the right, is the iPhone 12 Pro Max charging with the 15-watt MagSafe charger. Wireless charging speeds have also been increasing, slowly but surely. The Qi2 wireless charging standard, currently available across most of Apple's iPhone line and the HMD Skyline, currently sets 15 watts as the wireless charging speed available across most phones. Proprietary protocols are also achieving slightly faster speeds, such asApple's MagSafe, now supporting 25-watt wireless charging speeds for the iPhone 16. OnePlus sells a 50-watt wireless chargerthat can hit that speed when using it with the OnePlus 12 using its own AirVooc protocol. Wireless charging has its own conveniences, especially when taking an overnight charging approach and may already be a preferred method of charging when paired with magnetic accessories. But for now, it remains a slower way to juice up your phone than wired charging. The RedMagic 10 Pro's larger battery and faster charging are meant to help power gaming-intensive features, but similar features would be appreciated on phones that don't focus on gaming. Recharging a phone is a constant inconvenience for any device. It's why there are a multitude ofportable charging accessories, guides toreplacing a degraded phone batteryand so many options for wired and wireless charging. But when it comes to improving the speed of phone recharging, right now it's primarily the gaming phone space that's hitting the faster speeds that I hope find their way into more phones in 2025. If phones can start pushing past 45 watts, it may even lead to the additional convenience of allowing them to take full advantage of USB-C laptop chargers that are already available in speeds of 61 watts and up. Apple itself, for instance, offers a140-watt USB-C chargerthat's meant for the MacBook Pro, but it can be used with any phone that recharges over USB-C as well. The ideal goal for this is simple. Let me recharge my phone completely while I make my morning coffee. And then have the phone last until I need to go to bed. With the speeds already available on gaming phones, perhaps the hope of these speeds making their way to more devices isn't too far away.","Commentary: Your next $1,000-plus phone shouldn't be stuck at 45 watts and take an hour to recharge.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/its-time-to-bring-65w-or-higher-charging-speeds-to-all-premium-phones/,
406,"How to Close All Safari, Chrome and Google Tabs on Your iPhone","Perhaps you're handing your phone over to someone and want to keep some confidential information, well... confidential. It could be a search for birthday or holiday gifts for your kids that you don't want them to see or more sensitive or personal information displayed in a browser. Sure, you could individually close each tab in Safari, Chrome or Google search on your iPhone, but why do that when you can easily nix them all in one fell swoop? Closing all tabs is a simple enough method that nevertheless isn't always intuitive, so let's walk through how to do it for each platform. Safari perhaps wins the award for the least intuitive steps to close all tabs. To do so, you'll want to have a tab open, then hold down thetab iconin the lower right corner (it looks like two overlapping squares). Then, you'll see an option toClose All Tabs. Tap that, confirm you want to close them all, and then they should disappear. Chrome makes it a little easier than Safari to close all tabs. If you've got a browser open, tap theSwitch tabsbutton on the bottom (a square with the number of tabs inside). Then tapEditon the lower left side of the screen and hitClose All Tabs. A couple taps will allow you to quickly close all open tabs in Chrome. It's easy to rack up open tabs in the Google search app since a new one appears each time you seek a search result. To close all tabs, click on the square in the lower right corner, which should show the number of tabs you have open. Then, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and selectClose all open tabs. When the popup window appears, selectClose all. The Google search app has slightly different steps for closing tabs than Chrome.

409,'What We Do in the Shadows' Gave You a Bunch of Endings to Choose From,"After six seasons,What We Do in the Shadowsended on Monday. By the sound of things, the mockumentary crew following the Staten Island vampires around got enough footage for their movie. The news left the gang to process their time together in front of the camera and decide what would come next. In 2014, the narrative seed was planted withTaika Waititiand Jemaine Clement's movie of the same name. Who knew a show about a dysfunctional group of vamp roommates could last so long? Considering the heaps of comedy the cast and crew delivered throughout the series' run, there was plenty of worry that the FX comedy wouldn't stick the landing with this final episode. The episode, aptly titled The Finale, tied up loose ends, followed each character's story arc to fruition and gave plenty to mull over in the ways in which it ended. Instead of delivering one solid conclusion, What We Do in the Shadows went the way of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and gave the audience a multitude of endings to choose from. That may sound negative, but I assure you it was not. Whether you wanted a happy ending, a final sad beat or something ridiculous, the finale delivered. Before I continue, please be warnedthere are spoilers ahead. Please tread lightly if you have not watched the What We Do in the Shadows series finale. Read more:What We Do in the Shadows Fans Should Binge This Cult Horror Comedy Kayvon Novak, Kristen Schaal, Mark Proksch, Harvey Guillén, Andy Assaf, Natasia Demetriou and Matt Berry in the What We Do in the Shadows series finale. At the beginning of the episode, everything seemed to be going as usual, with Colin, Lazlo, Nandor, and Nadja filming their camera segments. That is until their shoots were interrupted by the announcement that the production crew that has lived with them for the past six years is finally wrapping up. Everyone took the news without batting an eye -- except Guillermo. His reaction ranged from panic to nostalgic to flat-out sad. His episodic journey has been one of the more tumultuous of everyone in the house. At the onset of the production, he wanted to become a vampire. Yet, once he was turned in season 5, he realized it wasn't for him. Let's not forget he is also a Van Helsing and has otherworldly fighting abilities when it comes to battling the undead. Guillermo's steady pursuit of value and acceptance in the house and the outside world was a common thread through all of the craziness. Now that the documentary was ending, was it all for naught? What will his purpose be moving forward? All signs point to him venturing away from this proverbial nest to start a new life with new friends somewhere else, and the notion is absolutely upsetting. What makes matters worse is the revelation that this isn't the first documentary crew to shoot footage of vampires. Guillermo is shown unreleased footage from 1958 of Nandor, Lazlo, Nadja, Colin and Jerry (RIP) having a house meeting. If you expected there to be any progress with these characters, you'd be incredibly disappointed. The movie never saw the light of day because, as Colin explained, they were ""just a bunch of boring people doing the same old sh** day after day. Nothing ever changes, no one grows, it's pointless."" Most of the episode found the group mulling over the best way to end the show. Guillermo's need for closure inspired Nadja to cut some vampiric corners and hypnotize the audience so they'd experience their own version of a perfect ending for the documentary. Cut to: A bizarre yet wonderful, three-minute-long send-up of the 1995 crime thriller The Usual Suspects. Now, look, I get the issue here. Many people in the audience may not be old enough to have even seen the movie, let alone understand the references in this portion of the episode. But that's fine. You don't necessarily need to be familiar with the movie to get what's happening here, though it does help drive the comedic bit home if you are. Playing on the Kaiser Soze reveal twist, the finale veers into fan service territory as it pans around the police investigation board. There are clips of Lazlo as Jackie Daytona, the regular human bartender from the show's second season; Nandor announcing his disdain for Joanna Roscoe in season 5's episode Local News; a quick shout-out to season 2's vampire-hunting club known as the Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area; and, of course, a nod to Nadja's vampire nightclub from season 4. Nandor and Guillermo team up as crime-fighting duo the Phantom Menace and the Cowboy Kid in the What We Do in the Shadows series finale. The penultimate episode found the vamps on the receiving end of an onslaught of violent attacks from opposing night creatures. Thanks to Guillermo's fight skills, Nandor was inspired and pitched an idea to Guillermo that signified a huge change in their relationship dynamic: Become a duo of crime-fighting vigilantes, Cowboy Kid and the Phantom Menace. Selling Guillermo on the idea was not easy, and why should it be? Nandor steadily disappointed his human familiar throughout the show's six-season run. Guillermo shot down the notion numerous times and decided it would be best to move on to greener pastures, saying a final heartfelt goodbye to Nandor before the credits rolled. But just a few seconds in, the credits stopped, and Guillermo returned to Nandor's coffin room, shooing away the crew members. It turns out he was performing for the cameras to give his own version of a worthy ending to the show. In a rare moment of friend bonding, Nandor invited Guillermo to sit in his coffin with him. With the emotional moments behind them, Nandor flipped a lever in his coffin, opening a hatch leading to their secret superhero lair a thousand feet below. With a sudden whoosh, the duo zoomed underground and out of sight. Does this mean Nandor and Guillermo will end up suiting up to battle evil-doers on the streets of Staten Island? That sounds like a worthy spin-off idea if I've ever heard one.",The show couldn't decide on just one.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-gave-you-a-bunch-of-endings-to-choose-from/,
410,Best iPhone in 2024: Which Apple Phone Should You Buy?,"What to consider iOS or Android? If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. But know that switching between the two has never been easier. Size Phones are big in general, with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and larger models topping out at 6.8 inches. That makes visiting a store and trying a phone out before you buy it quite important. Cameras Phone cameras have gotten better over the past five years. But don’t be fooled by how many cameras a phone has. More is not necessarily better. Software support Phone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support, ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features, but also keep your phone secure. Debuted in 2007, it feels like the Apple iPhone hasn’t left our pockets since. The newest iPhone 16 series dazzles with new processors, enhanced cameras and larger batteries, plus nifty buttons to toggle the flashlight or snap a quick photo. Apple still sells older models like the iPhone 15 and 14 at a lower price than when they first launched, as well as the most-affordable iPhone SE with a “classic” style home button. You can even snag a 13 – that is, if you can find it.  All these different options can make picking the best iPhone for you a tricky endeavor. The good news? CNET editors have tested and reviewed each iPhone model currently offered to help you find the best iPhone for you. What to consider iOS or Android? If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. But know that switching between the two has never been easier. Size Phones are big in general, with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and larger models topping out at 6.8 inches.

Software support Phone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support, ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features, but also keep your phone secure. The best iPhone for most people is the$799 iPhone 16. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have severalApple Intelligencetools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. The phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. Visual Intelligence isn't on the iPhone 16 at this time and will come via a software update in December. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. Read more:The iPhone 16 Helps My Eyes Feel Less Strained, Thanks to This Overlooked Feature With its handy new photography features, convenient Action button and elegant build, theiPhone 16 and 16 Plusare top-notch choices for Apple fans in search of a new phone. Parts of the iPhone 16’s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they’ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. For those who don’t need the Pro’s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won’t disappoint. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way. The iPhone 16 isn’t perfect -- it’s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it’s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some. TheiPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Maxhave everything we've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including good battery life, larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. This year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket -- if you can afford them. At $599, theiPhone 14is a great buy and solid upgrade, especially if you're using an 11 or older. There are two models the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and the6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plusthat normally starts at $699. Both phones are identical and really the deciding factor comes down to screen and battery size as well as price. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a long battery life, fast performance, great durability and wonderful cameras as well as safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Both phones came out in September 2022 originally but are still solid options today. In terms of drawbacks, neither phone has a high refresh rate screen, and always-on display or the newer Action button found on the 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series. But at hundreds of dollars less, we think that the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the best value to the dollar that Apple currently sells. With the launch of the iPhone 16, the regulariPhone 15is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, the iPhone 15 is a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones. The iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd. Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 but if you can find it on sale or clearance, it is still a good phone. The iPhone 13 came out in September 2021 and its best feature is a larger battery that, in our tests, lasted 4.5 hours more on a single charge than the iPhone 12, and nearly 3 hours longer than the new iPhone 14. The 13 also has Cinematic mode, which is basically a video version of Portrait mode, supports iOS 18. The iPhone 13 earned a 2021 CNET Editors' Choice Award. Just remember the iPhone 13 lacks satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services without a cell service and car crash detection, both of which are available on the iPhone 14, 15 and 16series. Such features may be important to consider if you're purchasing a phone for your child.Read our Apple iPhone 13 review. You might think the only appeal of the $429 iPhone SE (2022) is its price. And admittedly that's a big factor. But now that iPhone has stopped selling the iPhone 13 Mini, it's also a solid option for those who prefer smaller phones. On the outside, the iPhone SE has the same body as the iPhone 8, which makes it the only iPhone on this list that still has Touch ID. On the inside, the SE has the same A15 processor as the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 14 and 14 Plus which takes the 2017 camera hardware and gives it an injection of Apple's computational photography magic. The SE represents the classic iPhone design but with the added ability to run the latest version of iOS and apps. One of the quieter updates in 2022 was that the SE's back was upgraded to the back glass used on the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini. It's also your most affordable way into all of Apple services like FaceTime, iMessage and iCloud.Read our Apple iPhone SE (2022) review. While Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2024.Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review. We test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus. Photography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. Battery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update. We use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. Emergency SOS might be one of the most important features to come out on any phone this year. We perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published. Read more:How CNET Tests Phones Hold the iPhone first:You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person. Don't discount the last year's model:Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price. Buy an iPhone case and screen protector:You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on. Know what you care about most:Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almostrival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea. Seek out holiday discounts:Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange. An eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card. With the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This meansyou can't just pluck your SIM card outof your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number ofsmaller operators work with eSIM. Apple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018'siPhone XS,XS MaxandXR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networkscan be found on Apple's website. Apple's iOS 18is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is alsoavailable as an updatefor the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includesnew featuressuch as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models. If you can wait that would be best. Apple announced the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9. They will be in stores starting Sept. 20. Apple has been selling iPhones since 2007. The current lineup was released in September 2024 and all have a dust and water resistance rating of IP68, which means they can survive being submerged under 6 meters of water (about 20 feet) for 30 minutes. The screens are covered in Apple's Ceramic Shield which is a glass-ceramic material created by Corning, in collaboration with Apple, and consists of nano-ceramic crystals embedded in the glass matrix. It's highly transparent, and according to Corning, the tough structure formed by the crystals means it's less likely to break. One way to measure how long an iPhone will last is to look at the software and security support Apple offers for older models. iOS 18 can run on Apple phones as old as 2018's iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and XR. That's roughly five years of software support. Compare that to Samsung, which offers seven years of Android version upgrades and security updates. But software is only half the equation. The other part is hardware and durability. Every iPhone Apple sells has an IP rating for dust- and water resistance. Newer models also have Ceramic Shield, a glass-ceramic hybrid, that covers the display and is very durable.","Whether you’re eyeing the iPhone 16 or a discounted iPhone 15, we tested them all to help you find the best iPhone for your needs.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-iphone/,
411,How to Download All Your TikTok Videos Before the Impending January 2025 Ban,"Thelooming Jan. 19, 2025, TikTok banis getting more and more real -- and closer than ever. On Dec. 6, the US Court of Appeals upheld a law that requires China-owned ByteDance to divest TikTok or else face a ban in the US. John Moolenaar (R-Michigan) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Illinois), the chair and ranking member on aHouse of Representativescommittee on China competition, also urged the CEOs of Alphabet and Apple to be ready to remove the TikTok app from their app stores on Jan. 19. If you're a TikTok user, especially a creator, you're probably worried about a number of things. Will TikTok really disappear in January? Are there any similar apps that you can switch over to? Will all your TikTok videos get deleted? If you're worried about that last one, you should think about saving all the videos you've ever posted on TikTok. Or else they might get lost to the ether. Good thing it's easy to do. For more, check outhow to make your TikTok videos betterand11 privacy settings to change on TikTok. On your Apple or Android device, open the TikTok app and tapProfilein the bottom right of the navigation bar. Now go to any video you've posted, hit the three-dot menu button on the bottom right, and tap theSave videobutton. That will download the video to your phone's video library. Your video will be saved to your camera roll without any of the TikTok watermarks. If you have drafts you want to save, the process is similar but not exactly the same. Go into your drafts, tap a video and then hitSaveon the menu in the right of the editor. Once you exit, make sure to keep your draft saved or else it could be deleted. Unfortunately, there is no way to do this for every video at once, so it might become burdensome if you have dozens, or even hundreds, of videos posted to TikTok.

413,Best Chromebook of 2024,"When Chromebooksfirst arrivedover a decade ago, they were limited in what they could do and needed a web connection to do almost everything. Those days are long gone, and modern Chromebooks can do so much more, including work offline. Plus, Google regularly adds new features and updates security to keep you safe. CNET tested every model on this list, and we regularly review new models from Lenovo, Acer, Asus, HP, Samsung and others. All the Chromebooks on this list offer excellent performance and features for their price. Also, while we’re big fans of Chromebooks, if you're still unsure if one is right for you, here's how theycompare with a traditional laptop. The Acer Chromebook Plus 514 is the best Chromebook we've tested this year. It's a member of Google'sChromebook Plus laptop series, which guarantees a certain level of performance and hardware specs while also offering exclusive software features. It's meant to take the guesswork out of buying a Chromebook for those who want reliable power, not justdeep discounts and deals. With Chromebook Plus, you'll get the following: The newest Chromebook Plus laptops also include12 months of Google One AI Premium, which includes Gemini Advanced, Gemini for Google Workspace, 2TB of cloud storage and everything else available inthe $20-a-month Premium plan. Read more:Why a Chromebook Is Probably All You Need The Chromebook Plus 514 hits these requirements and does so for less than $300. That's a great price for a well-rounded Chromebook with a bright 14-inch display, roomy 512GB SSD, excellent webcam and long battery life. This 14-inch Chromebook Plus model delivers good performance and even better battery life, along with a respectably bright display with a matte finish to limit glare. And it has more storage than you'd typically find at its price. The model we reviewed lacked keyboard backlighting, which was a bit of a bummer, but Acer does sell models with a backlit keyboard that aren’t that much more expensive. With its mix of features and performance for the price, it’s easy to recommend the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 for school, work or home. Acer Chromebook Plus 514 review SCORE Acer's premium two-in-one doesn't stray far from its predecessor in terms of what it offers: sturdy design, nice-looking display, strong performance and long battery life. The main changes are an updated 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor but Acer removed the garaged pen for use on the touchscreen display. It still works with USI pens. Less expensive options are available, but if you want a Chromebook that'll last for years, this is it. Keep an eye out for a sale on this one, too: It normally lists for around $700, but can often be found on sale for less than $600. Acer Chromebook Spin 714 review SCORE The Lenovo Duet Chromebook (aka Chromebook Duet 3) is an awesome little 11-inch ChromeOS tablet with a detachable keyboard and touchpad. Its small size and performance aren't ideal for full-time use. The Chromebook Duet 3 is a good pick if you're looking for an affordable ultraportable device to get some work done on the go, sketch or jot down notes in class, or do simple stuff like email, web browsing, gaming, reading and streaming video. We've reviewed the next-generationChromebook Duet 11, but the Duet 3 is still perfectly fine and is heavily discounted for the holiday shopping season. Lenovo Duet Chromebook review SCORE Operating system:Chromebooks run on Google's ChromeOS operating system. It is different than MacOS and Windows and can't natively run software designed for those OSes. Apps:Chromebooks run web apps, Android apps from the Google Play store and Linux software. With more software going online, it's easier than ever to find the applications you need; still, before you buy, check if any necessary apps are available for ChromeOS. Specs:ChromeOS doesn't require powerful components to run smoothly (which is why you can find many good Chromebooks for less than $400). Still, we recommend getting the best hardware you can afford because they can't be upgraded later. AUE:Google gives all Chromebooks an auto-update expiration date. This is when a specific model will no longer receive ChromeOS security and feature updates. These can be checked on Google's site before you buy, and newer models are supported for 8 to 10 years. Security:Because it's nearly impossible for Chromebooks to be corrupted with viruses or other malware, you don't need to worry about extra software to secure a Chromebook. The review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features in relation to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. We test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, includingPrimate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6,Cinebench R23,PCMark 10, a variety of3DMarkbenchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop),UL ProcyonPhoto and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks fromGuardians of the Galaxy,The Rift Breaker(CPU and GPU) andShadow of the Tomb Raider. We have a different set of tests specifically for Chromebooks since they can't run Windows or MacOS software. For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price. The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on ourHow We Test Computerspage. A Chromebook is a laptop running on Google's ChromeOS instead of Microsoft Windows or Apple's MacOS. This means Windows or Mac software cannot be directly installed and run on a Chromebook. Instead, Chromebooks are designed to use web apps (like those for Microsoft Office 365), Android apps and Linux software. Because ChromeOS is built for efficiency and totake advantage of web or cloud services, the operating system runs well with less expensive hardware. While Chromebooks come in various sizes and designs, options are more plentiful with Windows laptops or Apple MacBooks, especially if you need to run demanding software. Again, ChromeOS is what really makes a laptop a Chromebook but there are some other differences to consider before you buy. Chromebooks run on Google's minimalistChromeoperating system or ChromeOS. When ChromeOS launched more than a decade ago, it was essentiallyGoogle's Chrome web browser. It has grown vastly in capabilities over the years but remains a simple, lightweight and secure operating system that can run briskly on even low-end components. Although ChromeOS can do much more today, quite a lot can be done entirely on the web these days. Take stock of everything you do on a daily basis and you may find there's nothing you can't accomplish with ChromeOS. There are several pros to a Chromebook but one big con will instantly rule out buying one. Chromebooks are not natively compatible with Windows or Mac software. If you need to run a specific Windows or MacOS program, you cannot do so directly from a Chromebook. That said,there are ways around it, including finding a substitute web or Android app, or a Linux equivalent. Also, if you need advanced photo- and video-editing capabilities, you'll want a Windows, Mac or Linux laptop. Basic photo and video editing are fine, but Chromebooks typically don't offer the graphics performance you need for demanding tasks or, again, the option to install Windows or Mac software and games. At least not directly on a Chromebook. Services like Adobe Photoshop on the web and Adobe Express make it possible to do more graphically demanding tasks. One other potential negative is the Auto Update Expiration date, or AUE. Currently, non-Google hardware is only supported for so long before it stops receiving ChromeOS and browser updates, including those for security. For models released now, the date is roughly eight to 10 years from the initial release of the device, but that's not always the case.Google maintains a list of AUE dates for all models, and you should check it before you buy a Chromebook, new or used. There are many pros to a Chromebook, but the biggest is the price. While premium models start at around $500, you can find excellent options for everyday use for around $350. The Lenovo Duet Chromebook, for example, is a two-in-one Chromebook with a detachable keyboard cover so it can be used as a tablet or a laptop and starts under $400. Like other laptops, a higher-end Chromebook generally means a better experience. Also, some of the same reasons Chromebooks are popular for schools and businesses make them excellent family computers. Everyone in the family can have separate Google accounts, and signing in gives them access to only their stuff and not yours. Accounts for kids can be managed withGoogle Family Link. It's nearly impossible for Chromebooks to be corrupted with viruses or other malware. If it isn't running quite right, you can reset it withChrome's Powerwash featureand in a couple of minutes, the system is clean and fresh. Just sign into your Google account and the Chromebook is completely restored. Read more:How to Reset a Chromebook in Under a Minute Yes and no. Since 2017, new Chromebooks all charge via their USB-C ports. Chromebooks typically need either a 45- or 65-watt power adapter. You'll need to check the specs for your specific model to find its power needs, typically found on the bottom of the Chromebook or on the manufacturer's site. (If it's given in volts and amps, you can get watts by multiplying the two together e.g. 15 volts x 3 amps equals 45 watts.) Using a charger that doesn't meet the power demands of the Chromebook may still charge it but at a slower rate. Also, if you're using the Chromebook while using a low-power charger, it will take even longer to charge fully. On the upside, Chromebooks will displaya notification if the USB-C cable you're using won't supportthe necessary performance.","Whether used for homework, paid work, or long nights of doomscrolling, CNET's editors have reviewed the perfect Chromebooks for you and your family.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-chromebook/,
414,Best PC Speakers for 2024,"What to Consider Budget Value-priced speakers can deliver acceptable sound, but if you want more premium sound with stronger bass and better clarity, you'll need to spend $200 or more. Size Bigger speakers tend to sound better, but not everybody has room for larger speakers, particularly if you plan to place your speakers on either side of a monitor or even your laptop. Subwoofer or no subwoofer? PC speakers that come with a subwoofer tend to deliver more bass. You have to have a place to put the subwoofer. Connectivity More robust connectivity options tend to add to the cost, but you can find some moderately priced PC speakers that offer good connectivity features. Surround sound? Most people focus on stereo sound for their PC setups, but if you're looking for a 5.1 surround system for your PC, you have several options to choose from. Return policy It's a good idea to buy your speakers at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they don't live up to your expectations. vs   At least when it comes tolaptops, PC makers have been making an effort to improve the sound they produce from their internal speakers.

Most people focus on stereo sound for their PC setups, but if you're looking for a 5.1 surround system for your PC, you have several options to choose from. Return policy It's a good idea to buy your speakers at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they don't live up to your expectations. Creative Labs' Pebble speakers have long been a top budget pick for PC speakers. The entry-level model is on its third generation, aka V3 (see below), and costs $35, while earlier versions can be had for even less. They aren't the greatest-sounding PC speakers, but people like them because their sound is bigger than their price. Creative went more upscale introducing the new-for-2024 Pebble X USB-C speakers ($90), which also come in a version called the Pebble X Plus with a mini subwoofer for $130. Larger than previous Pebble speakers yet still compact enough to fit in a backpack, the audio quality is unexpectedly good and may just be the best PC speakers that cost less than $100. SCORE Edifier makes a ton of PC speakers, and they're generally very good. We like the R1280DB Bluetooth Bookshelf speaker because it has all the features you want, including an optical input and Bluetooth capabilities in a fairly compact package that delivers very good sound for a decent price. Creative's Pebble speakers have been around for a while and the V3 version includes a USB-C plug (a USB-A adapter is included) that powers the speaker, as well as Bluetooth connectivity. They're available for $35, while the earlier V2 version (also with USB-C but no Bluetooth) can be had for around $25. With a higher peak power rating, note that this V3 model does play louder and sounds a little better than the V2. The step-up Pebble Pro speakers offer slightly better sound (improved bass response), RGB lighting and Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.0. These speakers don't deliver huge sound and they're light on the bass, but they're surprisingly decent for their low price and are a good plug-and-play solution for laptop owners with USB-C ports. A version with a subwoofer that delivers more bass is available for only $40. The Pebble Pro speakers may be your better bet if you're on the fence about getting a subwoofer. SteelSeries' line of Arena PC gaming speakers is available in three models, starting with the entry-level Arena 3, which retails for around $124. The speakers may not have premium build quality, but I liked their design and compact size (although not too compact), and I thought they sounded good for a stereo 2.0 system with single drivers. The step-up Arena 7 adds tweeters and a separate sub as well as a lighting element for $120 more, while the line-topping Arena 9 is a full surround system for $550. The Arena 3 speakers connect to your PC with an analog 3.5mm cable but also feature Bluetooth connectivity for connecting your smartphone or tablet wirelessly. You can tilt the speakers to your liking and easily adjust the volume with a knob on the right speaker. There's also a companion app for Windows PCs to tweak the sound. While there's enough bass to provide decent punch to games, movies and music, don't expect the bass to go that deep or have a ton of kick to it. If you're looking for a better deal in terms of price and specs, you'll want to go with the Arena 7. The Logitech Z407 is a compact system with a small subwoofer that doesn't exactly have a premium feel (it's an all-plastic affair and the satellite speakers are quite light), but it's attractive and has some nice features. For starters, it's simple to set up. You can use it in wired mode with an auxiliary 3.5mm cable or connect it to your computer via USB. The majority of people will connect their devices to it via Bluetooth. It comes with a hockey puck-sized controller (powered by two AAA batteries) that doubles as a Bluetooth transceiver between any Bluetooth-enabled audio device and the speaker system. You can skip tracks forward and back by tapping on the top of the puck and turning the dial to control the volume. It's also worth noting that the speakers can be stood up vertically or horizontally. It's a nifty design. The sound is good at close range but the bass isn't exactly tight (you can only expect so much for the price). This would work fine as an audio system in a small room, but just doesn't have the juice to sound good in a larger room (it's touted as having 80 watts of power but power ratings don't mean all that much). The most recent addition to the Audioengine family, the A1 speakers sound good for their compact size, particularly in terms of their clarity. Like the more expensive A2 Plus (see below), they're a little bass shy, but if you're using these at close range (as one tends to do if you're looking at a computer screen), the bass will seem ample. You can connect a subwoofer to them, but that would substantially raise the price for the package. In a small room, they could work as your main speaker system, but they just don't have enough power for a larger room. The nice thing about them is they look quite slick. They're also simple to set up and wireless, so you can connect your computer -- or another device -- via Bluetooth. You just have to hit the pair button on the back to engage pairing mode. A set of speaker wires connects the two speakers (the left speaker has the amplifier and all the connectivity options). You can also use the auxiliary-in port to connect your computer with an included cable. The Audioengine A2 Plus is very similar to the new A1 but offers slightly more refined styling and slightly better connectivity options (it adds USB connectivity), although it lacks a subwoofer output. Like the A1 it has a Bluetooth option with support for aptX streaming (for aptX-compatible devices). For $269, it delivers excellent sound in a compact, attractively minimalist design. It's a good option for people who can't afford the larger Audioengine A5 (see below), which does sound significantly better but takes up more space. Audioengine's powered A5 speakers have been around for several years and have received some technology upgrades over time. The wired-only version is $399, but if you want to add a Bluetooth option, the price goes up to $499. You can connect to your PC either with a cable or via Bluetooth, but having Bluetooth is nice if you want these speakers to double as standard bookshelf speakers. As you might expect, they have significantly more bass than Audioengine's smaller A2 Plus, and they resemble traditional monitor speakers. With a built-in 150-watt amp, they deliver clean, dynamic sound with lots of volume and will rock a medium-sized room without a problem. Canadian speaker company Fluance is known for delivering speakers with a lot of power for their price, and its attractively designed Ai41-powered bookshelf speakers do just that for $250. While they don't weigh as much or have quite the build quality of Audioengine speakers, they do offer strong sound and good connectivity options, including optical digital input and Bluetooth options. I tried the white and bamboo versions but the speakers are also available in black. They're about the same size as Audioengine's A5 Plus speakers (see below) but cost half the price. I can't say they sound quite as good as the A5 Plus speakers, but they do sound clear and well-balanced and have just enough bass to make you think they aren't bass-shy (there is a subwoofer connection if you want to add a sub). You can get a little more bass by placing them near a wall. A remote is included for not only raising and lowering volume but also tweaking the treble and bass settings. These will fill a small room with sound. Note that if you want a wired connection to your computer via the headphone port, you'll need an RCA to 3.5mm cable (less than $10 on Amazon) as it's not included. The Ai41 has 5-inch drivers while the step-up Ai61 has 6.5-inch drivers. The Ai61 does offer a bit more bass and power for $50 more. The Ai41 is already fairly large for a set of computer speakers. They could also be connected to your TV via an optical connection. Harman Kardon's SoundSticks have been around for 20 years and have always been a favorite of Mac users because they were marketed from the get-go to owners of the early iMacs. The SoundSticks 4 offers some design changes over earlier iterations, particularly to the subwoofer, which has a cleaner, sleeker look without the plastic funnel inside. The SoundSticks 4 are rated for 140 watts of power -- the SoundSticks 3 were rated for 40 watts. Also, Bluetooth connectivity now comes standard (with the SoundSticks 3, there was a step-up model you had to buy to get Bluetooth). The speaker comes in two color options, one with white trim and one with black. The system is a little more compact than you'd think seeing some of the pictures, and it does deliver strong sound with bass that will rattle a table at higher volumes if you leave the sub on your desk (the sub is slightly smaller at 5.25 inches compared to 6 inches for the SoundSticks 3). From what I remember of the SoundSticks 3, this new model does sound fuller. The only fault I found with it was the lack of a wired digital connection. Like the previous version, there's an analog cable that you plug into the headphone jack or auxiliary output on your computer or another device. As a result, I tended to just use Bluetooth, which gives you more flexibility with the placement of the sub (the power cord is a little short). You do have to connect the elegant mini tower satellite speakers to the sub with cables that are color-labeled for easy hookup, so the sub has to stay pretty close to the satellites. It's also worth noting that you don't have to be a Mac user to buy these speakers. They're compatible with any audio device that has Bluetooth or a 3.5mm audio-out port. Razer's second generation of its Leviathan gaming soundbar, aptly named the Leviathan V2, gets prettier and pricier, at $250 as opposed to $200. While it gains Bluetooth wireless support, it loses some other useful connections; say bye-bye to analog and optical, for example. Still, it's a compact and solid alternative to headphones or a beefier surround setup that might be overkill or require too much space. You can get the soundbar by itself for $100, but the version with the subwoofer sounds significantly better. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new PC speakers. Value-priced speakers can deliver acceptable sound, but if you want more premium sound with stronger bass and better clarity, you'll need to spend $200 or more. Bigger speakers tend to sound better, but not everybody has room for larger computer speakers, particularly if you plan to place your speakers on either side of a monitor or even your laptop. PC speakers that come with a subwoofer tend to deliver more bass, but you have to have a place to put the subwoofer. Some of the desktop speakers on this list have analog connectivity, and many offer a digital connection so you can plug them right into a computer with a USB cable. Some computer speakers offer Bluetooth connectivity, which lets you easily pair them with all your devices, includingtabletsandsmartphones. As you might expect, more robust connectivity options tend to add to the cost, but you can find some moderately priced PC speakers that offer good connectivity features. Most of the computer speakers on this list consist of two separate powered speakers joined together by a speaker cable, with a subwoofer sometimes thrown into the mix. They deliver true stereo sound, but you can also buy PC speakers with multiple speakers for a surround sound setup to fill your home office. We've focused primarily on stereo PC speaker setups. It's a good idea to buy your speakers at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they don't live up to your expectations. We test PC speakers based on four key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria aredesign,sound quality,featuresandvalue. In general, larger speakers do sound better. The big issue with smaller speakers is they tend to lack bass. One option is to buy smaller satellite speakers but also get a subwoofer to capture the full range of sound effects offered by your audio. Also look for speakers that offer a built-in surround sound for a richer experience. All the PC speakers on this list have to be plugged in. You can find speakers like Creative's Pebble V3 speakers that are powered by a USB connection so you don't need a separate power adapter. That's your best bet for a more mobile system. You can. No one is stopping you. If you want true stereo sound, a pair of bluetooth speakers is the way to go. Bluetooth speakers can also be helpful for creating a true surround sound experience.","Upgrade your sound game with the top PC speakers of 2024, handpicked by our experts just for you and all your needs.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-pc-speakers/,
415,Best AirPods for 2024,"What to consider  Design Knowing whether you want open earbuds, noise-isolating earbuds or over-ear headphones helps narrow down your choices. Budget Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new AirPods. Fit It's key that the AirPods you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. Consider the differences between in-ear and over-ear AirPods before buying. Durability You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for AirPods models that we note have sturdy build quality. AirPods or Beats? Apple owns Beats, and the two brands share a lot of features, but Beats tend to work better with things that aren't made by Apple. Return Policy Where you buy earbuds from matters, in case the headphones or earbuds turn out to be a bad fit for you. vs   Apple makes some of thebest wireless earbudsandheadphoneson the market -- and that includes models from Beats, which Apple acquired several years ago. Most recently, it introduced two newAirPods 4 earbuds, one with surprisingly effective active noise canceling for an open-ear design. While we're impressed with the AirPods 4 ANC in particular, theAirPods Pro 2are arguably the best Apple AirPods you can buy if you don't mind having silicone ear tips jammed in your ears. I've tested and fully reviewed all of Apple's headphones and earbuds that are on this list. We also keep a close eye on their prices so we can bring you thebest deals on every AirPods model. What to consider  Design Knowing whether you want open earbuds, noise-isolating earbuds or over-ear headphones helps narrow down your choices. Budget Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new AirPods. Fit It's key that the AirPods you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. Consider the differences between in-ear and over-ear AirPods before buying. Durability You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for AirPods models that we note have sturdy build quality. AirPods or Beats? Apple owns Beats, and the two brands share a lot of features, but Beats tend to work better with things that aren't made by Apple. Return Policy Where you buy earbuds from matters, in case the headphones or earbuds turn out to be a bad fit for you. Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with theVision Proas well as the novel hearing aid mode to better hear the sound around you. Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. SCORE If you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have more features. Ultimately, however, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it. SCORE While the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensiveStudio Budsand new-for-2023Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of theAirPods Pro'sfeatures, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. SCORE Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. SCORE Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. The transparent version is getting a lot of attention (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' ""acoustic architecture"" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds. SCORE Love 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read ourfull reviewto find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats. SCORE Available in four color options, the Solo Buds are missing some key features found in more premium buds, including a battery in their very compact charging case, ear-detection sensors and active noise canceling. But they get the fundamentals right. They're lightweight and not only offer decent sound quality and strong battery life but very good voice-calling performance that rivals what you get with the company's more expensive Studio Buds Plus. The AirPods come in three styles: open earbuds (AirPods 3 and AiPods 4), noise-isolating earbuds with noise canceling (AirPods Pro 2) and over-ear headphones (AirPods Max). Some people like the standard AirPods because they have an open design and don't require you to jam silicone ear tips into your ears. Note that the discontinued AirPods 2, which are based on the original AirPods design, have longer stems and slightly smaller buds than the AirPods 3. The new AirPods 4 are slightly more compact than the AirPods 3 but slightly larger than the AirPods 2. Meanwhile, the Beats Fit Pro has built-in wingtips that may help you get a more secure fit. Newer models also feature USB-C charging ports to better align with the rest of Apple's new charging ecosystem, replacing the long-used Lightning port. Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new AirPods. The quality of value-priced AirPods continues to improve as more models release, so you can often find good affordable AirPods on sale for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $300 or more -- sometimes much more in the case of the AirPod Max. It's key that the AirPods you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. Consider the differences between in-ear and over-ear AirPods before buying. You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for AirPods models that we note have sturdy build quality. Because Apple owns Beats, the various AirPods models and Beats models can share similar components and features. Beats products tend to be geared to both Apple and Android users, while the AirPods tend to be focused more toward Apple users (they have more exclusive features for Apple users), although they can be paired with Android devices. Because the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds aren't a good match for your ears. Comparisons for the prices of each AirPods model on this list Along with all of our wireless headphones and earbuds, we test Apple AirPods based on six key criteria:design,sound quality,noise-canceling performance,voice-calling performance, featuresandvalue. We assess not only how comfortably the AirPods fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. With wireless headphones and earbuds, we'll note if they're water-resistant, but only a few full-size headphones have water- and dust-resistance ratings, which is especially important forworkout headphonesyou may take to the gym or on a run. We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment. If the AirPods we're testing feature active noise canceling, we evaluate ANC performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out onto city streets to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they do at muffling not only street noise but also people's voices. Those that are able to reduce the most amount of ambient noise are noted and rated highly on this list. Some great-sounding AirPods aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness through a double tap to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. The newest models even incorporate hearing health metrics with hearing tests and a new hearing aid mode. We also take a look at the companion app for the AirPods if there is one and how user-friendly it is and wireless charging capabilities. When we test voice-calling performance, we make phone calls on noisy city streets and evaluate how well the AirPods reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices. Call quality is a key metric in today's work-from-home world, so we're sure to assess this feature in several fields. We determine value after considering the strength of the AirPods against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared with other models in their price class. Some models require additional purchases, like a wireless charging case, to get the most out of their features, so we take those needs into account, too. AirPods 3: With the arrival of the AirPods 4, Apple is phasing out both the AirPods 3 and AirPods 2. As a result, you may see some nice discounts on the third-generation AirPods as they exit the market. Slightly larger than the AirPods 4, they have better battery life than their successor and their case has wireless charging (only the step-up AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation have wireless charging). But with improved sound quality and Apple's more advanced H2 chip, the AirPods 4 -- even the entry-level model -- is superior to the third-generation AirPods. Beats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio earbuds often sell for $150 and offer decent sound and performance. The new Studio Buds Plus is a significant upgrade, with better sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance, so we recommend users buy those instead. AirPods 2: The AirPods 2 are an incremental upgrade to an already excellent, fully wireless headphone, but sound quality, design and fit are basically the same. Such incremental upgrades tend to be a little boring. And on the surface anyway, the new AirPods aren't exciting. However, thanks to those updated components on the inside, including a new H1 chip that supports Bluetooth 5.0, improved audio synchronization and always-onSiri, they're definitely better in small ways that a lot of people will appreciate. Beats Flex: Yes, these are ""wired wireless"" earbuds -- with a cable connecting the left and right earbud, but they're also the most affordable wireless Apple headphones you can buy (Beats is a subsidiary of Apple). Equipped with Apple's older W1 chip, not the H1 found in the AirPods 3rd Generation, AirPods Pro and Beats Fit Pro, they don't have such extra features as spatial audio. However, they sound good and work well for making voice calls. The newest AirPods are the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C), which hit stores in September 2023 and have some small upgrades from the 2022 version of the AirPods Pro 2 that included Lightning charging. The third-generation AirPods with enhanced functionality, improved sound and an updated design arrived in stores in October 2021. Meanwhile, on the Beats side, the Beats Studio Pro headphones were released in July 2023 while the Studio Buds Plus were released in May 2023. The Beats Fit Pro -- which shares most of the same features as the original AirPods Pro -- arrived in November 2021. While they're not AirPods by name, we and others have referred to them as ""the sports AirPods you always wanted."" With their integrated wingtips, the Beats Fit Pro may offer you a more secure fit than AirPods Pro 2 and they do cost $50 less (and sometimes even less when they go on sale). Otherwise, the AirPods Pro 2 are better -- they have slightly better sound quality and noise canceling along with better voice-calling performance. Also, note that the Beats Fit Pro is missing wireless charging and the MagSafe compatibility found in the AirPods Pro 2. If you can help it, no: The various AirPods models typically sell for less online at other retailers like Amazon and Walmart. Amazon, meanwhile, typically matches the lowest price at other retailers. Generally, we'd only buy AirPods at the Apple Store if we want engraving, which isn't available elsewhere. If you opt to go into an Apple Store for Apple deals, you should ask about price matching. While Apple doesn't seem to have any official policy, it's been reported that it will offer up to 10% price matching. As an example, that would be $25 off the AirPods Pro, which list for $249. That's not much, but it's worth asking to see if you can get 10% off. The short answer is, not really when you're talking about spatial audio with head tracking for movie and TV watching. While the AirPods Max offers the best sound overall, using the spatial audio virtual sound feature is largely the same experience on all the AirPods that support it.",Looking for new AirPods?

419,Best Gaming Laptop for 2024,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. What to consider Price The sweet spot -- for mainstream 1440p gaming and an RTX 4070 GPU that will last you longer without sacrificing AAA play -- sits roughly between $1,200 and $2,000, depending upon what you're willing to sacrifice. Operating system Microsoft Windows is the most popular choice for gaming laptops, but if you've got an M3 Pro or better or an M4 MacBook, Apple's been working with developers to increase the prominent games for MacOS. Screen Most gaming laptops feature large displays between 14 and 18 inches; the older and cheaper models generally have 15.6- or 17-inch models. OLED delivers the highest contrast, most colorful and fastest displays, but you might want to look for HDR support, which they don't always have. Processor Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for gaming laptops; most games depend on the GPU for their graphics performance, but sims and other games that populate worlds based on player or environmental interactions use the CPU quite a bit, so look for at least a Core i7 HX and better or AMD 8040HS-series CPUs or faster.  Graphics All gaming laptops will feature a dedicated GPU from either Nvidia or AMD (and to a far lesser extent, Intel). Nvidia is the most popular and generally the best performing for the money. Look for an RTX 40xx or Radeon 7000-series discrete GPU or later.  Memory For memory, we highly recommend at least 16GB of RAM; 8GB will hamper performance in a lot of cases. Storage 1TB is good; more is usually better, depending upon how much extra it costs.

Storage 1TB is good; more is usually better, depending upon how much extra it costs. My favorite model that has a good balance of price, weight, performance, screen and design at the moment is theAsus ROG Zephyrus G16. The model we tested is relatively pricey at $2,700 for an upscale configuration with a 16-inch OLED screen, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD and an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. Solid configurations start at $2,000. I consider it the best general choice for gaming, but its little sibling -- theG14-- is a little more highly rated because of its more general-use advantages, like size, weight and lower price. Thebest of the budget gaming modelsis theAcer Predator Helios Neo 16. Acer knows how to wring performance out of every component, and this one is fast for its low-end RTX 4050 graphics, which is sufficient for 1080p gaming and a bright display. Note that we're coming up on CES 2025 when all the laptop manufacturers traditionally refresh or reinvent their lines based on new chips from AMD, Intel and Nvidia. The new models don't usually ship until between March and June, so you may want to hit pause on your buying until after we know what's coming -- or until the 2024 models drop in price if you want to save some money. My recommendations for thebest laptopsare based on our benchmark-based and hands-on testing (we play games, too). We continually test laptops, so we'll be updating our recommendations as we review the latest models. Read more: Both the G16 and its smaller 14-inch sibling are excellent gaming laptops and very similar, but I chose the 16-inch, mostly for the larger screen, more powerful GPU and broader port selection. It's also a good pick for creative work, thanks to the calibrated OLED display. Acer's mainstream value gaming line, a step up from the Nitro and a step below its straight Predator Helios models, this 16-inch model starts at roughly $1,000 (look for it on sale too) and squeezes excellent performance from the lower-end components, making it one of the best performers among budget gaming laptops. It's got a lot of plastic, but it's still solidly built, the 1,920x1,200 165Hz display is bright and it has plenty of ports and a 1080p webcam. We reviewed a Core i5 model, but there are different configurations for less money that should perform better which are available now.  Alienware offered one of the first of the new 18-inch models, and with the R2 it streamlined the design. The big screen is great for gaming as well as for work, and because of all the space, it can deliver class-leading performance with lots of cooling and a ton of ports and connections, as well as be configured up with wazoo to flagship CPUs and GPUs. If you want all that power for work, it's a great desktop replacement as well. The system starts at $1,900, but that's with an RTX 4060; if you just want to use that big screen for 1080p and some 1440p games, that's fine. If you want to play high-quality 1440p and connect to an external display for 4K, you'll probably want a more expensive model with an RTX 4080.  The Mac still isn't a very popular platform for gaming. Apple has been increasingly spurring developers of high-profile games to support the company's Metal graphics programming interface to show off MacOS and iOS code-once, play both performances. Whether you're the developer on the hook or need to use a MacBook but want to play games, my recommendation is the M4 Pro or Max 16-inch for the big screen and better (M4 Pro) or best (M4 Max) GPU. It's really expensive; our test system was priced in the ballpark of $3,500. Or if you don't care about the screen size, even the M4 Pro configuration of the 14-inch comes in at a lot less than the 16-inch. You definitely want the Pro or Max for the GPU.  Although the ROG Zephyrus brand is one of Asus' thin-and-light gaming lines, this particular 14-inch is targeted at creators and doesn't deliver best-in-class gaming performance. It's certainly good enough for top-quality 1080p. It features an excellent OLED display and is very well designed, it also comes with Asus' full-featured -- if a little confusing -- Armoury Crate software. Although HP categorizes the Transcend as a gaming laptop, I consider it a general-purpose laptop that's also good for gaming, partly because it lacks a lot of the performance controls I expect from gaming laptops. It can be a good value on sale, say, roughly $1,200 or less for the configuration we tested, but since it's performance-constrained, I wouldn't pay a lot for it as a mostly-for-gaming laptop. It does wrap sufficient power for mainstream use and gaming in a compact, stylish design with an OLED display.  Dell’s Alienware line isn't usually associated with the budget class, but Dell lowered the entry price for its second-gen m16 model to where it’s a sensible budget/midrange buy. The line starts at $1,500 for a configuration with an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, GeForce RTX 4050, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and a single-zone RGB keyboard. Upgrading to an RTX 4060 adds $100 to the bill. The model we tested with RTX 4070 graphics and a per-key RGB keyboard runs about $1,750. The RTX 4050 and RTX 4060 models will serve you better playing games at 1080p than 1440p, but if you're looking for 1440p on the cheap you can lower your quality settings a bit to make it work.  Origin PC Eon17-X v2:An above-average gaming laptop, this 17.3-inch is a solid big-screen alternative. Though it can't keep up with competing 18-inch models like the Alienware m18 R2, it holds its own against them when similarly equipped (with an Intel Core i9-14900HX and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090), and like other big systems it has the cooling to handle the high-performance components (and the loud fans to go with it). Though it lacks some more common software customization options, you can personalize the cover with Origin's custom UV prints. Lenovo LOQ 15IAX9I:It's super cheap, with a dedicated Intel Arc GPU that lends it a wee bit of 3D muscle for casual 1080p play. For gamers looking to get the most performance for their money, the trick to finding the right gaming laptop is getting enough performance to play 3D games without sacrificing too much in other areas like the display and overall build quality while also avoiding older models on sale with outdated or soon-to-be-outdated parts. Here's our expert advice on what to consider to get the most gaming laptop for your money. Gaming laptops start at well below $1,000 with slower GPUs (like an older model or RTX 4050) geared toward 1080p play and at the high end, the sky's the limit. The sweet spot -- for mainstream 1440p gaming and an RTX 4070 GPU that will last you longer without sacrificing AAA play -- sits roughly between $1,200 and $2,000, depending upon what you're willing to sacrifice. Microsoft Windows is the most popular choice for gaming laptops, especially budget gaming laptops. If you've got a M3 Pro or better or M4 MacBook, Apple's been working with developers to increase the prominent games for MacOS. So don't give up. Most gaming laptops feature large displays between 14 and 18 inches; the older and cheaper models generally have 15.6- or 17-inch models. OLED delivers the highest contrast, most colorful and fastest displays, but you might want to look for HDR support, which they don't always have. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for gaming laptops; most games depend on the GPU for their graphics performance, but sims and other games that populate worlds based on player or environmental interactions use the CPU quite a bit, so look for at least a Core i7 HX and better or AMD 8040HS-series CPUs or faster. All gaming laptops will feature a dedicated GPU from either Nvidia or AMD (and to a far lesser extent, Intel). Nvidia is the most popular and generally the best performing for the money. Look for an RTX 40xx or Radeon 7000-series discrete GPUs or later. For memory, we highly recommend at least 16GB of RAM; 8GB will hamper performance in a lot of cases. For a gaming laptop, we don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you either play only one game at a time or you want to spend a lot on an external SSD and your system has at least a Thunderbolt/USB4 port to at least store games in progress. 1TB is good; more is usually better, depending upon how much extra it costs. Gaming laptops have traditionally had pretty bad battery life, which typically lasted as little as two hours of nonstop gaming. You also couldn't play most complex games -- GPU- or CPU-intensive ones -- on battery power. Processors would get throttled back and screens dim during hard-core gaming sessions, so a laptop that felt nimble when connected became a slog on battery power, turning your epic battles into battles of frustration. That's been changing as Intel, AMD and Nvidia have concentrated on improving their power management technologies. No, you still can't play for 10 hours on battery power, but now you can find some great gaming laptops with 10-hour battery lives -- albeit not for playing -- to make gaming on the road more feasible.  The fastest graphics processor currently available in a laptop is still the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4090, with the usual Max-Q variants. The Max-Q versions run at slower frequencies than their full-size siblings -- that keeps down the noise and heat and allows them to fit into thinner designs. RTX models also accelerate ray-traced rendering and provide intelligent upscaling/optimization (also known as DLSS) where it's explicitly supported; AMD's Radeon GPUs have their equivalents, but AMD has yet to catch up on ray-tracing performance and its optimization doesn't have as high a performance multiplier as DLSS. Support for Nvidia's Advanced Optimus, which you'll still rarely see in cheaper systems, also lets you switch between a high-power-draw dedicated GPU mode and a power-saving mode on the fly instead of requiring a reboot and can take advantage of adaptive refresh-rate technologies for the display. AMD's current high-power laptop GPUs don't hit the highs of Nvidia's best, but they tend to be solid midrange performers. The ""S"" versions are the lower-power models designed to fit better in the thinnest laptops.  Yes, but not always. In general, sims benefit from faster clock speeds and more cores since those are required for the heavy calculations when worlds get complex. More and more AAA games are also starting to balance loads better between the CPU and GPU where possible as well. If you bounce back and forth between a game and the rest of Windows, it can help speed up that kind of multitasking a bit.  There's a lot to know if you're choosing a new gaming laptop. All the major companies offer configurations up to 360Hz, though it doesn't come that high for every resolution or screen size. And for many a gamer, they're not essential: 240Hz maximum should be fine for those few times you can get frame rates above 240fps. Even 144Hz will do for many people. Artifacts like tearing, caused by the screen refresh rate becoming out of sync with the frame rate, are affected by your games as much as your laptop brand and hardware. There are a lot of 120Hz 4K screens and a ton of 165Hz through 240Hz QHD (1440p) options. If you plan to connect to an external display and not travel with the laptop, it's less important to splurge on the screen and put your money into power and a dedicated video connection.

420,Officials Warn Against Shooting Down Drones as More Sightings Reported,"It's been a monthsince mystery drones were first spottedover parts of New Jersey, and the US government still hasn't given definitive answers on their origin, even as sightings have spread to other states. States including Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Maryland have also reported sightings oflarge dronesin the skies, and speculation ispointing towardforeign government surveillance, UFOs or even aircraft that aren't actually drones. Lawmakers in states including New York are planning todeploy drone-detection technologythat could help avoid incidents such as having airports shut down, as happened on Dec. 13at Stewart Airfield in New Yorkandat Wright-Patterson Air Force Basein Ohio early on Dec. 14. Meanwhile, even as President-elect Donald Trump is urging the government toshoot drones out of the sky, officials are warning citizens not to take drone firing into their own hands. TheFederal Aviation Administration has warnedthattaking a page from Ukraineand shooting down drones could turn the aircraft into dangerous projectiles that could harm property and people. Despite claims that the drones so far have posed no safety threat, those who've been living with drone sightings for weeks where the sightings began – in New Jersey – have expressed concern that there's not enough information being shared with the public.

421,You Can Download the First iOS 18.3 Developer Beta on Your iPhone Right Now,"Apple recently releasediOS 18.2to the general public, but the company is already looking beyond that for the iPhone. Today, Apple released iOS 18.3 beta 1 for developers. It's not apparent what and if there are any new features, but there do seem to be some bug fixes to Genmoji and other Apple Intelligence features. We'll update you with more information as we get it. Heads up: You can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta and use Apple Intelligence only if you have aniPhone 15 Pro,iPhone 15 Pro Maxor theiPhone 16series. If you don't have the iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max, you can still use this guide to download the latest iOS 18 dev beta -- you just won't get the Apple Intelligence features. Read more:iPhone 16: What We Know About the Release Date, Leaks and More You can use Apple Intelligence to create original emoji, proofread your emails, summarize articles in Safari, prioritize your notifications, analyze your audio transcripts and reduce interruptions on your iPhone and other compatible devices. Siri will use AI to assist you better, thanks to integration with ChatGPT. iOS 18 in general brings a redesigned home screen, acustomizable control center, locked and hidden apps,scheduled text messages, a new password manager app, text messaging via satellite and a huge redesign to the Photos app. Read more:iPhone Mirroring Has My Attention: Here's How Apple Says This New Feature Will Work The Apple Developer program has long required a fee to join, at $100 per year. Last year, with the release of the iOS 17 developer beta, Apple created a free tier of the Apple Developer program, which allows you to download any developer betas for free as long as you have an Apple ID. If you want to try out iOS 18.3 today, here's how. Don't miss:Apple Intelligence Arrives, But Only in Developer Beta for Now Just because you can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta for free doesn't mean you need to, or should. Early developer betas, such as this one, are intended for developers to test their apps on upcoming versions of iOS. It's also a way for developers to identify and report bugs, which helps Apple improve the software before it's released to the general public. That's a major reason why you may not want to download the iOS 18.3 developer beta on your phone: the bugs. A software bug, or any other glitches, can make your phone unstable. You may not be able to use some of your favorite apps, and even if you can, you may deal with apps that crash unexpectedly. The performance of your entire phone could be affected; the developer beta could make your phone lag or lead your battery to drain faster than usual or even overheat. I've downloaded developer betas on my personal iPhone for the last decade, and haven't faced any major issues. It's mostly just annoying when an app crashes or my battery dies quickly, but I've always managed. If you have a backup iPhone, you should definitely use that for the iOS 18.3 developer beta, because you won't need it every day, so you won't feel the full effects of any bugs or other issues. If you don't have one, running iOS 18.3 developer beta on your primary should hopefully be fine. In case you still want iOS 18 but don't want to deal with the developer beta, there's always the morestable public beta for iOS 18, which is now live. Unfortunately, there is no iOS 18.3 public beta just yet. Before you start downloading the iOS 18.3 developer beta, there are a few things you should know: In case you ever want togo back to iOS 18, here's our step-by-step guide. If your iPhone doesn't automatically back up, you can do it manually through your settings. Now, you're ready to sign up for the Apple Developer program. There's now a free tier of the Apple Developer program, which allows you to download any developer beta without paying. Using the Apple ID that's connected to the device you want to update to iOS 18.3, do the following: 1.Go to theApple Developer website, hit the three-dash menu in the top-left and then tapAccountin the menu that appears. 2.Sign in with your Apple ID. 3.Finally, read through the Apple Developer Agreement, check all the boxes and hitSubmit. You won't get full access to the development tools that the paid Apple Developer program membership offers, but you'll have access to the iOS 18.3 developer beta. If you're a developer, you should consider signing up for the paid version. You can then scroll to Software Downloads to check out everything you can install, including the iOS 18.3 developer beta. You can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta manually, but the easiest way to do it is with an over-the-air update -- just like you would download and install your regular iOS update. After you sign up for the Apple Developer program, you should see the option to download the iOS 18.3 developer beta in your settings. To download the iOS 18.3 developer beta over-the-air, here's what you need to do: 1.On your iPhone, go to theSettings>General>Software Update. 2.Next, go into Beta Updates and tap theiOS 18 Developer Betaoption. 3.Finally, go back and tapDownload and Installunder the new ""iOS 18.3 Developer Beta"" option that appears. If you don't see the iOS 18.3 beta option, you'll need to wait a bit. Enter your passcode, agree to the terms and conditions and then just wait for the update to install on your iPhone. Depending on your internet connection, the entire process should take about 10 or 15 minutes. Once your phone reboots, you should be running the iOS 18.3 developer beta. The problem with an over-the-air update is that it requires a certain amount of storage, so if your storage is nearly full, you won't be able to use the option in the previous section. Fortunately, you can use your computer to update to the iOS 18.3 developer beta. 1.On your Mac, go to this Apple Developer Programdownload page, find ""iOS 18.3 beta,"" clickDownload Restore Imagesand download the iOS beta software restore image for your iPhone model. 2.Connect your phone to your computer and enter your device passcode or hitTrust This Computer. 3.Open a Finder window and then click your device in the sidebar underLocations. 4.Finally, hold down the Option key, clickCheck for Updateand choose the iOS 18.3 beta software restore image you just downloaded from the Apple Developer website. If you have no storage on your iPhone, this is the way to go to get iOS 18. The iOS 18.3 developer beta software will begin to install on your iPhone. Wait for a few minutes and when your phone reboots, you should have access to iOS 18.3. Once you download the iOS 18.3 developer beta, you must join a waitlist for Apple Intelligence if you haven't already. Go toSettings>Apple Intelligence & Siriand tapJoin the Apple Intelligence Waitlist>Join Waitlist. It took a couple of hours for Apple Intelligence to arrive on my phone, but some people have reported the AI features going live a few minutes after waitlisting. Once the feature is live, you can go back here to disable Once Apple Intelligence is available to you, you'll receive a notification and you can go through a quick tutorial of some of the features that are now live, including Writing Tools and AI-powered Siri. You can go to the Apple Intelligence & Siri page to disable the setting if you no longer want to use it.

Wireless charging: MagSafe vs. Qi Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack will wirelessly charge iPhones much faster than more affordable Qi models. Either way, you'll need a MagSafe-compatible phone case to use a wireless power bank. Power capacity vs. Weight Chargers with a high charging capacity provide more power but they weigh more. That's of particular note if you plan on traveling with the charger in a purse, backpack or pocket. CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise.

Wireless charging: MagSafe vs. Qi Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack will wirelessly charge iPhones much faster than more affordable Qi models. Either way, you'll need a MagSafe-compatible phone case to use a wireless power bank. Power capacity vs. Weight Chargers with a high charging capacity provide more power but they weigh more. That's of particular note if you plan on traveling with the charger in a purse, backpack or pocket. iPhones generally have good battery life, but if you travel and use it for vlogs or navigation, it's likely to die sooner than expected. To be prepared in case of an emergency, a power bank can come in handy. Most power banks are no longer bulky. You can get sleek, slim and lightweight portable chargers to slip in your pocket alongside your phone, but there are also heavy duty options if you need to stayed powered up over many days. The power banks on this list are fairly easy to take along with you and are a great backup plan, whether you're in an emergency or not. Read more:31 Great Tech Gifts Under $100 While iPhone owners are still in the switchover from Lightning to USB-C, all iPhones from the iPhone 8 onward support the USB-IF's Power Delivery fast-charging standard. Every power bank here -- except the two Anker Nanos with built-in USB-C connectors/cables, which only work for the iPhone 15/16 series -- will work with any current iPhone as long as you use the proper cable. This also means that every wired power bank here will work withAndroid phones, too, so you won't have to worry about replacing it if you switch platforms down the line. You also have wireless charging options, with companies like Anker now offering Qi2 power banks. Although more expensive,Qi2-certified wireless chargersoffer 15-watt fast-charging capabilities and full MagSafe compatibility. That means you'll get twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhones and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging. If we had to pick the single best iPhone power bank right now, it would probably be theAnker MagGo 622or the new Qi2-certifiedAnker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K, which has an adjustable and foldable stand. Anker also released the higher capacity Qi2-certifiedMagGo Power Bank 10Kwith an integrated kickstand. Again, nearly all of the models below will work with any recent iPhone so long as you have your proper Lightning-to-USB-C (iPhone 14 and older) or USB-C-to-USB-C (iPhone 15/16) cable. Starting with the iPhone 12, MagSafe took wireless portable charging from a touchy disaster to an absolute godsend, and I highly recommend themexceptfor two subsets of iPhone users. Wireless charging doesn't play nice with thick heavy-duty cases, and the heat generated by MagSafe charging can be uncomfortable for those of us living in hotter climates. (It makes for a nice pocket-warmer in the winter, though.) At first MagSafe power banks were limited to 7.5W, but 15W MagSafe banks have become widely available in the last two years. TheiPhone 16 series now supports 25W MagSafecharging, but no power banks on the market today do, and that doesn't appear to be changing in the foreseeable future. While we wait for newer models, here are our current picks. All the products reviewed below have been tested by me or other expert CNET editors. This list is geared toward iPhones, but any portable battery pack on the list with USB-C or USB-A out ports will work perfectly well for charging anAndroid smartphone(or any other portable gadget), so long as you provide a compatible smartphone cable. Wireless charging should also work for Android phones that are so configured. Read more:Best iPhone Chargers What's cool about Anker's 622 magnetic battery is that it's a wireless battery that has an integrated magnetic flap that converts into a stand. You won't get fast wireless charging from this 5,000-mAh battery (it charges at up to 7.5 watts), but it's slim and easy to carry around. It charges via USB-C, and if you use a USB-C-to-Lightning to charge your iPhone, it will charge at a faster rate of 12 watts. That's not as fast as what a 20-watt USB-C power adapter can deliver, but it's faster than 7.5 watts. Note that Anker has updated this model to move the charging port to the side (from the bottom), so you can charge it while using it as a stand. That's a worthy upgrade worth the premium price versus theold version(which confusingly retains the same 622 model number). The Anker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K has an 6,600-mAh battery that can fully charge most iPhones one time. It's Qi2-certified, which means it offers 15-watt fast charging capabilities and is fully MagSafe compatible, offering twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhone 13, 14 and 15 models and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging. Available in five color options, this model has a foldable design with customizable viewing angles. While it comes with a USB-C cable, you'll need a USB-C charger with more than 15-watt output to hit those 15-watt charging speeds. You can take the power bank on the go or leave it plugged in to use as a wireless charging stand when at home. It's fairly pricey at launch but will hopefully get some discounts as more competitors hit the market. The Baseus Magnetic Mini Wireless Portable Charger is a compact wireless power bank available in sizes from 5,000mAh up to 20,000mAh that sticks to the back of MagSafe-enabled iPhones (or MagSafe-enabled iPhone cases) and charges your iPhone at 7.5 watts. If you're looking for faster charging, you can plug a USB-C-to-Lightning or USB-C to USB-C cable into the battery and get 20-watt charging speeds. It also offers pass-through charging, meaning you can charge the battery while charging your phone. Being available in multiple capacities allows you to choose the smaller 5,000mAh or 6,000mAh sizes if you need to keep things slim or bring enough juice to keep your phone alive during your long weekend getaway. The 6,000mAh and 20,000mAh are only available in purple at this point -- which is the best color anyway -- but the 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh have more variety if you're too scared to rock such a fun hue. If you're looking for a new power bank for your new USB-C equipped iPhone 15, Anker's Nano Power Bank with an integrated foldable USB-C connector is an appealing choice -- and it also charges Android devices (or anything with a USB-C charging port). It's available in multiple color options. This 5,000mAh power bank weighs in at 3.5 ounces or 100 grams. It features 22.5 watts of fast charging power with the option to charge two devices at the same time if you plug a cable into the power bank's USB-C in/out charging port. (Charging two devices simultaneously divides the charging power in half, delivering 11.25 watts to each device.) If you're looking for a beefier portable battery option, Anker's 10,000-mAh Nano Power Bank is one of the better values out there, with an integrated USB-C cable. It's not huge, but it's certainly on the larger side and can be used to charge multiple devices (along with the USB-C cable, there are also USB-C and USB-A out ports). The battery charges your devices at up to 30 watts. I also appreciated the LCD that shows precisely how much battery life is available. Infinity Lab is the new accessories subsidiary of Harman Kardon -- a company that is, in turn, owned by Samsung. (Got that?) I like its InstantGo 5000 and InstantGo 10000 power banks, which come with an integrated Lightning cable for easy charging for iPhones (the InstantGo 5000 is currently sold out). The larger 10000 mAh costs more and is heavier. It can charge most iPhones twice. Both models are also well designed with a slightly grippy finish on the top and bottom of the battery. The Anker MagGo Power Bank 10K has a 10,000-mAh battery that can fully charge most iPhones around 1.75 times. It's Qi2-certified, which means it offers 15-watt fast charging capabilities and is fully MagSafe compatible, offering twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhone 13, 14 and 15 models and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging. Available in five color options and not much bigger than the MagGo Power Bank 6.6K, this model has a retractable kickstand and an LCD that displays the remaining battery life. It comes with a USB-C cable, but you'll need a USB-C charger with more than 15-watt output to hit those 15-watt charging speeds. You can take the power bank on the go or leave it plugged in to use as a wireless charging stand when at home. Like the 6.6K version, it's fairly pricey at launch but will hopefully get some discounts as more competitors hit the market. For those looking for a higher-capacity battery, the MagGo Power Bank 10K is probably a better choice than the MagGo Power Bank 6.6K. But I do like the foldable stand a little better on the Power Bank 6.6K. If you're looking for a bigger portable battery that charges your phone wirelessly, the Baseus Magnetic Wireless Power Bank is an excellent option. It houses a 10,000-mAh battery that can charge most iPhones around two times -- but it's still somewhat compact. The magnet is strong, and I also liked that it has an integrated flip-out kickstand, so it converts into a stand. There's also an LED battery life indicator on the back of the battery that tells you exactly how much juice the battery has left (you see the actual percentage). The Baseus Magnetic Wireless Power Bank is available in three color options with the black version currently costing a few bucks less. Thanks to gallium nitride technology, chargers have been getting more powerful while shrinking at the same time. The latest example of that trend is Anker's new line ofGaNPrime chargerswith next-generation GaN 3 technology, which the company says is even more energy-efficient. The Anker Power Bank 733 combines a 65-watt charger with a 10,000-mAh portable battery and is part of the newGaNPrime line. It's pretty compact for what it is and offers two fast-charging USB-C ports and one fast-charging USB-A port. You can charge up to three devices at once, but note that to get a full 65-watt charge for a laptop, you can only plug in the laptop. You don't want your phone to go dead on the mountain so it's always good to pack a battery pack. MyCharge calls its new line of magnetic power banks Superhero MagLock, implying that they're real saviors. I was impressed by their design. Not only do the batteries, which come in various capacities, have strong magnets and stick really well to the back of any MagSafe-enabled iPhone, but they have raised coils, which are supposed to help reduce heat levels while charging. It does seem to work. All the MagLock batteries charge Qi-enabled iPhones at 5 watts, although you can get faster charging if you go wired and use a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. I also liked how there's a chime when the charging starts and your phone tells you how much juice is left in the battery pack (it's tied into iOS 15). You can wirelessly charge Android devices as well but the MagLock won't stick unless you have a metal ring on the back of your phone's case (stick-on rings are available). The SuperHero MagLock is available in a few colors and has a glossy finish. It's currently the best-designed magnetic power bank -- better even than Apple's. Mophie's Powerstation Wireless Stand with MagSafe isn't cheap but is a versatile 10,000-mAh battery with both a stand and MagSafe charger built-in and also has a threaded tripod mount at the bottom. Since this is an official MagSafe charger, the battery does charge at 15 watts, making this among the fastest wireless external battery chargers out there and will also charge the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro models with MagSafe. If you use a USB-C-to-Lightning cable (not included) with it, you can charge at 20-watt speeds. You can also charge two devices at the same time. If you're looking for a compact external battery pack for your iPhone (or any smartphone), Mophie's pocketable Power Station Mini (2022) features a 5,000-mAh internal battery and 20-watt USB-C PD fast charging. (You'll need a USB-C cord to take advantage of that fast charging if you're an iPhone owner.) That battery will allow you to fully charge your iPhone. For a little more, you can pick up the 10,000-mAh version with dual USB-C ports -- both come in black or blue colors. Also, note that Zagg, Mophie's parent company, offers a 20% discount on your first purchase if you shop there. The Anker 523 PowerCore Slim 10K PD is impressively slim for a 10,000-mAh portable phone charger and has a fast 20-watt USB-C out charging port (it's also a USB-C input to charge its battery), plus a 12-watt USB-A out port. While the Anker 313 PowerCore Slim 10K is cheaper, this offers fast USB-C outcharging, which makes spending the extra dough a big plus if you have a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. Nimble's updated Champ portable charger uses recycled plastic in its construction. You have to pay a bit more for going green, but it's a nice, compact 10,000-mAh charger that features 20-watt PD fast-charging with dual USB-C ports (one on either side of the power bank) that allow you to charge two devices at the same time. If you are charging two devices, your charging speeds will be limited to 10 watts per device. Nimble also sells the Champ Lite, a smaller power bank, as well as some higher-capacity fast-charging battery packs. Every new iPhone from the iPhone 5 in 2012 to the iPhone 14 series in 2022 used Apple's proprietary Lightning connector for charging. With the iPhone 15 series, Apple has made the jump to USB-C. The differences between these two connectors matter only if you're seeking out a power bank with an integrated cord. Otherwise, you'll want a model with USB-C or USB-A output -- that can be used to power your iPhone (or nearly any small electronic device) with the cable that came in the box. Most iPhones since the iPhone 8 and iPhone X models introduced in 2017 offer inductive wireless charging. Apple's standard for these phones is called MagSafe, and power banks that are fully MagSafe compatible -- like Apple's own MagSafe Battery Pack -- will charge iPhones at a fast 15-watt level when the power bank magnetically adheres to the rear of the iPhone. Many other more affordable models will still attach to iPhones magnetically, but charge them at half speed (7.5 watts). In all cases, you'll need to make sure the iPhone has a MagSafe-compatible case. (Apple has indicated that the iPhone 15 series is compatible with the emerging Qi2 standard, but the company has yet to specify if that includes any benefits versus the original Qi standard, such as higher capacity charging.) Most baseline power banks now start at a 5,000-mAh capacity, which should give you at least one full charge for an iPhone. Chargers with 10,000 mAh or more are available, but they weigh more. That's of particular note if you plan on traveling with the charger in a purse, backpack or pocket. At the current time, we do anecdotal testing on these models. Each is fully charged and used on a recent iPhone model for at least a week in real-world conditions. We verify that charging speeds and recharge times are within expected parameters and -- for models with integrated stands or cables -- confirm that the connections and build quality are sturdy and free of any notable annoyances or caveats. Anker PowerCore Fusion Portable Charger:This Anker model is effectively an oversized wall charger with a built-in 5,000-mAh battery. It's got two standard USB charging ports for simultaneously juicing up your phone and a secondary gadget (or two phones). A little LED indicator on the side lets you check the charge level at the press of a button. Anker PowerCore III 10K Portable Charger:The Anker PowerCore III 10K portable charger has fast USB-C out charging (18 watts) as well as a USB-A port and up to 10-watt wireless charging. It's not magnetic, so your phone won't stick to it but it will wirelessly charge any Qi-enabled devices. Mophie Snap Plus Juice Pack Mini:Mophie's magnetic power bank is similar to Anker's but is slightly slimmer (it's suitable for a 5,000-mAh battery) and doesn't have an integrated flap that converts into a stand. It's designed to adhere to the back of MagSafe-enabled iPhone or MagSafe cases, it comes with a ""snap adapter"" ring to stick onto the back of Android devices so they'll be magnet-friendly. MagSafe for iPhone -- not to be confused with the identically named magnetic power connector for MacBooks -- is an Apple standard that allows for inductive charging with magnetically attached batteries. Qi wireless chargers don't necessarily have a magnetic component but also allow for inductive charging. Official MagSafe for iPhone accessories and Made for iPhone wireless chargers (based on the Qi standard) should charge the iPhone at up to 15 watts. Unofficial wireless and magnetic chargers may still work but will be limited to 7.5 watts and lack some of the additional power management and on-screen indicators that official MagSafe chargers do. Yes, these power banks should charge any device that's USB-powered, such as phones, headphones, ebook readers and Bluetooth speakers. Some may also charge larger devices such as tablets, iPads and the Nintendo Switch, albeit at slower speeds. You'll stand a better chance of charging the larger devices if you get a charger with USB-C PD (Power Delivery) support. Don't expect to charge laptops or Chromebooks without getting larger, higher-capacity power banks that are specifically designed for that purpose (with 65 watts of power output or more). Power banks for iPhones invariably have USB inputs and outputs for charging themselves and other devices, respectively. (Some power banks have single ports that double for both.) The USB-A port is the ""classic"" rectangular USB port that's been on computers since as early as the late 1990s. The newer, smaller USB-C port is reversible (there is no ""top"" or ""bottom"" to the plugs) and has the capacity to charge at higher speeds. Some power banks have integrated cables that terminate with Lightning (iPhone-specific) or USB-C cables.","If your iPhone battery is showing its age or you’re gearing up for a vacation, these are the best portable chargers to keep handy.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-power-bank-for-iphone/,
423,"Warframe 1999 Is About Time Travel, Love and Eldritch Gods – and It's Fantastic","For years, the free-to-play space sci-fi shooter Warframe was a game about child soldiers carving a warpath across the universe, desperately trying to do the right thing even when it's not obvious what that is. More recently, Warframe's story has shifted to explore themes of forgiveness, love and maturity -- many old enemies became allies during the New War against the Sentient threat, and Warframes are more respected in the Origin System than they've ever been before. This is where the game's newest expansion, Warframe 1999, opens up -- and it's free to play today. Learning to break the cycle of violence perpetuated by their old masters won't save the Tenno -- the heroic warrior faction to which players pledge loyalty -- when the threat originates from outside of this reality. The void entity known as the Man in the Wall threatens to breach the veil between worlds, promising catastrophe. Only one man can help stop the end of the universe, and he's MIA. It's time for a time heist. From here on out, this article contains spoilers for Warframe 1999's story. With an insidious eldritch being rap-tap-tapping away at the door to the Origin System, the Tenno need to find the brilliant scientist Albrecht Entrati if they hope to save their home. The catch is that the Man in the Wall has Entrati trapped in the year 1999, right before the turn of the century. Famously, this is when the Y2K bug triggers a nuclear explosion that wipes the city-state of Hollvania off the map, spelling the end for the famous inventor. Naturally, the only conclusion is to send the Drifter (that's you) back in time through void magic shenanigans to make sure that doesn't happen. The Drifter and Arthur get into a quick scuffle, because who would trust a killer robot ninja that drops out of nowhere? That's how you meet up with the new allied syndicate, the Hex -- a group of six protoframes (humans who have only partially been subsumed by the Warframe bioinfestation) who are fighting a war of attrition against the techrot and Scaldra military that threaten innocent civilians. Teaming up with the new crew, a race against time starts to save Entrati so he can put a kibosh on the Y2K bug and stop the nuclear explosion -- which is all well and good until you find a secret tape from the scientist that informs you that the two of you need to ride the energy produced by that explosion to make it out of 1999 and back to your reality. Warframe is, at its core, a game about rejecting cycles of violence and doing better than your predecessors. Suffice it to say, no old man is getting away with demanding that you sacrifice your new friends and hundreds of thousands of innocent lives to make a clean escape. Major Neci Rusalka leads the Scaldra, a military group locking down Hollvania. Her intentions aren't exactly pure. Both Entrati and the eldritch Man in the Wall attempt to break the Drifter's will, letting the events play out that lead to the Hex's downfall in the failed reactor mission. Rather than ride the energy out of the past, the Drifter chooses to die with their allies, forcing Entrati to reset time once again. Now, the Drifter's time loop includes the entirety of the year 1999, giving them ample time to prepare to siege the nuclear reactor and prevent Y2K from blowing it sky-high. After escaping the Duviri Paradox, you'd think the last thing the Drifter would want is to get trapped in another time loop. 1999 is a true point of divergence, one where history can be changed. The Tenno's actions from here on out will decide the fate of the Hex, and the greater Origin System. Warframe 1999 introduced Atomicycles, which you can ride through the streets of Hollvania. Sadly, you can't do the Akira slide. Digital Extremes hasn't ever been shy about pushing Warframe in strange new directions. That inevitably means some content drops like the Railjack space battles and the Duviri roguelike mode are written off by many players as disappointing (and buggy) launches. Warframe 1999 isn't one of those disappointments; not by a long shot. The members of the ragtag but capable Hex are brilliantly voice-acted, and I especially liked the jaded combat medic Lettie and the peppy mechanic Aoi. The Hex is a group of people who definitely have personal reasons to be risking their lives trying to save a bunch of civilians who want nothing to do with them, and I'm excited to explore their stories more as the relationships begin to unfold over the coming weeks as more chapters of Warframe 1999's story release. The stakes are rising higher as a new conflict with the Man in the Wall ramps up, Digital Extremes has done a commendable job making personal conflicts feel important too. So far, Leticia ""Lettie"" Garcia has been pretty rude to me as she runs around patching up wounds, but I like her no-nonsense attitude. It's clear that the studio is using the expansion to re-examine why, and for whom, players are fighting. The Tenno are becoming their own people. They're no longer weapons that are told who to kill and who to spare. Putting it all on the line for six good (super powerful) people doesn't feel like a stretch at all. I'd put the fate of the universe in jeopardy to save Lettie, too. We'll have to wait to see how Warframe 1999's grander story unfolds, how we'll stop the nuclear explosion and if we can bring the Hex back with us to help battle the Man in the Wall in the Origin System back in the game's present, but Update 38.0 laid a strong foundation for this new era of Warframe. After blasting through the 1999 story, there's still plenty of new content to explore. Cyte-09 is the 59th unique Warframe. He's a stealthy frame that prioritizes high critical damage with his exalted weapon. Completing The Hex mission will unlock the blueprint to build the new Cyte-09 Warframe -- based on Quincy Isaacs of the Hex, this new frame uses an exalted sniper rifle to pump out massive damage with bullets that ricochet between enemies' heads. The AX-52 assault rifle returns for anyone who missed its Twitch drop, and the Vesper-77 pistol makes its debut in players' arsenals. Cyte-09's signature weapon, the Reconifex heavy assault rifle, is also available to earn through the Warframe 1999 bounty missions. New extermination and assassination nodes have been added allowing players to fight the Scaldra and techrot infestation across the Hollvania tileset. The H-09 Efervon Tank is one of the Scaldra's secret weapons. If you're able to take it down, your arsenal will get a boost from one of the new Arcanes. A new survival mode variant, Hell-Scrub, raises the stakes by having players more fiercely defend their life support capsules (lest it be turned against them), while a new endless mission variant, Legacyte Harvest, sees players capturing increasingly dangerous variants of the techrot-infested. Digital Extremes is finally reinvesting in PvP action with the Faceoff mode, which sees opposing squads of players race to complete objectives while sending each other hazards, enemies and other obstacles. Warframe grows ever closer to Destiny 2 with this mode -- it plays a little like that game's PvPvE Gambit mode, minus the player invasions. There's even a romance system that players will be able to play around with each weekly reset. If you're dating one of the members of the Hex when the seasonal cycle concludes, you'll be able to get a New Year's kiss. Like I said, love is what Warframe's really all about at the end of the day.",The Tenno take to the timestream to take part in a new chapter of Warframe's epic sci-fi story.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/warframe-1999-is-about-time-travel-love-and-eldritch-gods-and-its-fantastic/,
424,Bought an iPhone 15 or 16? Try These USB-C Accessories First,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. If you got theiPhone 15or the latestiPhone 16thisholiday shopping seasonfor a discount, you're going to need a few new accessories. Apple shifted to Type-C from the Lightning port with the iPhone 15, so you'll need Type-C accessories to accompany your new device. The USB-C connector is a technological standard that's been included on nearly all mobile devices and computers -- not to mention, many Apple products -- for several years now. Aside from USB-C charger upgrades and other must-haves for a new iPhone (like a new case), there's a sturdy collection of ""nice-to-haves"" (which could include newwireless speakersorheadphones). Check out our top picks below to find USB-C accessories that are compatible with the iPhone 15 and 16. This upgrade makes it easier to connect a host of devices to your iPhone, whether it's an external power source like a portable battery, external storage devices, wired headphones and any other compatible USB-C accessory you can think of. The iPhone 15 line is the first to have USB-C charger ports on the phone itself, but Apple has been shipping cables with USB-C on the power source end for the past couple of years. Still have an old-school wall adapter with a rectangular USB-A port? That'll work with the addition of some cheap dongles (see below), but it might result in a slower charging speed. For the best experience, invest in a wall adapter with native USB-C ports with at least 20 watts of power or more. For under $20, we like the Anker 323, which offers a maximum of 33 watts of power and includes both USB-C and USB-A ports, for maximum flexibility. We charged an iPhone 14 Pro from zero to 57% in 30 minutes with this model; it should have no problem doing the same fast charging on the iPhone 15 series. Pro upgrade:If you want an even more capable charger, step up toAnker's 735 charger. It's got an extra USB-C port and can handle charging up to 65 watts enough for most laptops. People who bought this charger rated it 4.8 out of 5 on average. Reviewers were happy with the fast charging speed and mentioned that its compact size and folding prongs make it convenient for travel. To be clear, your new iPhone 15 includes a 1-meter (3.3-foot) Apple USB-C cable in the box. You'll want some extra cables for other rooms in the house, or for traveling. Most recent generic USB-C cables should suffice, but we like these Anker cables, which are braided for high durability and rated for up to 100 watts of charging power. Even better, Anker gives you a two-pack of 6-footers for $16. That beats the $19 that Apple charges for its1-meter braided cable(presumably the same one that ships with the new iPhones), and the $29 the company chargers for itsLightning to USB-C adapter. (Do yourself a favor and buy these cables instead of that adapter.) Pro upgrade:If you want a cable that's fully rated for higher-wattage charging, faster data speeds and 8K video output, step up to theAnker 515 USB 4 cableinstead. The Anker 333 USB-C cables have an Amazon rating of 4.7 out of 5. People love the convenience of the 10-inch length, the durability of the braided cable and the fast charging speed. A few reviewers noted that these cables aren't ideal for fast data transfer, while a handful reported issues with using these adapters for iPhones. The latter could indicate this product doesn't work with every car with Apple CarPlay onboard Adapters like this will let you plug a USB-C cable into a USB-A slot. (Your biggest challenge will be not losing them -- just leave them plugged into the slots on your PC or chargers.) Note that these aren't rated for bandwidth beyond USB 2.0, but they're good for charging or data transfer in a pinch. For instance, we just used one to juice up an Apple Watch charger (with a USB-C plug) from a USB-A wall outlet during a recent hotel stay. These Syntech USB-C adapters have a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars. These have been commended for their compact size, value and convenience over buying new charging blocks. Like recent iPhones, the iPhone 15 series supports MagSafe charging -- Apple's take on the Qi wireless charging standard -- which lets you magnetically attach battery packs and other accessories to the rear of the handset. (In fact, Apple has confirmed that the iPhone 15 supports the emerging Qi2 standard, but the company hasn't specified exactly what that means in terms of charging speeds or wattage limits.) This Baseus magnetic battery pack isn't fully MagSafe compliant -- it won't charge the iPhone at full speed -- but for its sub-$40 price, it's a better buy than Apple's own, now-discontinued$95 battery pack, which has less battery capacity, requires a Lightning cord and lacks the built-in kickstand. If colors are your thing, this one has more options than the standard Apple White. It also has twice the capacity of the similarAnker 622 MagGo(which is a good choice if you want a lighter option). With a rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars, the Baseus magnetic power bank won approval for its long battery life and how securely the magnet fits against a phone. People also loved the bonus features, which include a hidden kickstand and its digital battery percentage display. Although you certainly can strap your phone to the top of your favorite console controller, it's not the most portable solution ever. There are a couple of gaming controllers designed to wrap around your phone so the buttons are on either side of the screen, and if you're looking for the best, what you really want is a Backbone. You can choose between Xbox and PlayStation button layouts with matching color schemes, and the grips couldn't be more comfortable for on-the-go gameplay. It's a little more expensive than using a standard controller, but it's much more compact, and you can actually charge your phone while you play thanks to the USB-C pass-through. The Backbone One Mobile gaming controller has a rating of 4.4 out of 5. Reviewers like that it’s lightweight and how well it fits your phone compared to previous models. Some people didn’t like the sensitivity of the joysticks and some considered the grip to be too small. The fact that you have to remove your phone case to use was a point of friction for some. One of the cool things USB-C brings to the iPhone 15 Pro series is the ability to connect to professional equipment for photography and videography. If you're interested in trying that out without spending an enormous amount of money, this field monitor looks to be a great place to start. You can connect the monitor to your phone via USB-C and get a waveform readout so you can correct it without having to move your phone. It's a relatively inexpensive way to try something new on your phone and a great way to dive deeper into the world of iPhone photography. With a rating of 4.3 out of 5, the Feelworld FW568 V3's reviews touched on the great picture quality and lightweight feel. Reviewers wish there was a touch screen and didn’t like the fact that this product doesn’t come with a power supply. (Make sure you buy batteries if you order one.) For a lot of folks, the big question with every new phone and new case is, ""Can I use my PopSocket on this?"" The great news is that when it comes to the iPhone 15, the answer will always be yes. All you need to do is make sure you have the right thing to connect your favorite PopSocket design to, which is why we recommend everyone pick up the new MagSafe Round. It's packed with magnets to ensure a sturdy connection either straight to the back of your phone or to any MagSafe case. If you're looking at a case that doesn't come with MagSafe, the Round comes with an adhesive ring of magnets you can stick to the inside and keep that sturdy connection. When you're ready to charge your phone, just pull down on the PopSocket and you're good to go. Case option:Prefer acase with an integrated PopSocket? The company offers that for the full range of iPhone models. With a rating of 4.6 out of 5, the PopSocket is praised for its strong magnet and ease of installation and removal. While many people loved the sleek and attractive design, others considered it to be a bit bulky.",These top accessories include everything from power banks to chargers to help you get the best out of your new iPhone and that USB-C connector.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-iphone-15-accessories/,

You pay a monthly fee to use a vendor's servers, which can provide you with improvedsecurity,performanceand the ability to apply modpacks for customized multiplayer experiences. Which Minecraft hosting service will best optimize your Minecraft gameplay? One option isMinecraft Realms, Mojang's official server subscription service (available for Java and Bedrock editions). If you want more back-end control over your server -- or modpacks and maps that aren't available in Realms -- you'll need a modded Minecraft server. In that case, you may opt for a third-party server host that can provide sufficient bandwidth and control over your Minecraft world seed's configuration and settings. Below, we've reviewed some of the best Minecraft server hosting vendors, including Hostinger, Shockbyte and GGServers. We focused on service providers that offer 24/7 support and a variety of plan options. CNET is in the process of updating our assessments of the best web hosting services. We periodically update this story to maintain accurate prices, but our overall rankings may change after we've been able to re-evaluate these services. Read more:Best Web Hosting for 2024 Hostinger has aTrustPilot rating of 4.6 out of 5, with more than 30,000 reviews. Hostinger also earned top marks in ourhands-on Hostinger review, with excellent server performance and management tools. While our review process focuses onshared hosting for websites, it's safe to assume that you'll enjoy similarly excellent performance if you choose one of its Minecraft server hosting plans. Hostinger's Minecraft server plans also include mod support,DDoS-- distributed denial of service -- protection and automated backups. Hostinger's most affordable Minecraft hosting plan starts at $5 a month for the first two years (renews at $14 a month) and includes 4GB of RAM, one vCPU core and 50GB of storage. The most expensive Hostinger Minecraft hosting plan starts at $20 a month for two years (renews at $100 a month) and includes 32GB of RAM, eight vCPU cores and 400GB. All of Hostinger's Minecraft servers useNVMestorage for faster, more reliable performance than the more standardSSDstorage. MCProHosting -- now merged with ApexHosting -- offers ten Minecraft server host plans. The most affordable option costs $6 a month for the first month and $8 a month afterward for 1.5GB RAM and 25 player slots. The most expensive plan starts at $80 for the first month and rises to $104 a month afterward for 32GB RAM and unlimited player slots. Every plan includes unlimited storage space, worldwide server locations and DDoS protection.

It does have aTrustPilot rating of 4.3 out of 5with more than 9,000 reviews. GGServers offers ten different Minecraft server hosting plans, each of which comes with the option for standard or premium (which doubles the price). Standard plans offer DDR4 2133 MHz RAM, 3.2-4GHz CPU and 400MBps read/write SSD. It also costs an extra $2 a month to add on a MySQL database or unlimited slots. You don't get access to all nine server locations, either. Premium plans offer DDR4 2400 MHz RAM, 4.4-5GHz CPU, 2,500-plus MBps read/write SSD and include the MySQL database, unlimited slots and all nine server locations worldwide.

It has aTrustPilot rating of 4.3 out of 5with almost 4,000 reviews. Your server needs to have enough resources to run your game smoothly for the number of players you want/expect to have in your server. There are three resource types to pay attention to here: Exact resource requirements vary based on the number of players you're going to host on your server, the operating system of your server and the resource packs you're using. There are many online resources, like theMinecraft Fandom site, where you can find information on the resources your server will need for your exact game setup. You can also reach out to customer service for any host you're considering to learn about the types of games their servers are capable of supporting. Your host should let you choose adata centerclose to your location to store your server on. This will improve loading speeds and ensure that your game runs smoothly. If you're running a game with international players, ask the host you're considering about the steps they take to ensure that the game will run smoothly for people in other locations. Your Minecraft server host should provide an easy-to-use Control Panel where you can manage key aspects of your server. Your Minecraft server host should provide a firewall,DDoSprotection and anti-virus software to keep your game secure and protect your players' data. Look for 24/7 customer service accessible via live chat and email. You may also want to choose a host with phone support. It's important to note that we didn't explicitly ""test"" the Minecraft hosting provider options on this list. Instead, we compiled a competitive overview based on a variety of factors, including third-party ratings and features offered by each hosting company. We've also weighted the rankings of these businesses by the Better Business Bureau and TrustPilot. With that data in hand, we split them into two tiers: Best Minecraft hosting providers (top tier):These Minecraft host vendors all have a rating of A or higher from the nonprofit Better Business Bureau (except in cases when the companies are based outside of North America and not included in the BBB ranking system) and a rating of 4.0 or higher out of 5 from TrustPilot, a Danish consumer review site. All of the TrustPilot rankings are based on at least 1,000 user reviews. All of the vendors listed in our top picks also say they offer 24/7 support and modpack support. Other Minecraft hosting options to consider (second tier):All of these Minecraft host vendors have TrustPilot ratings of 4.0 or above; those ratings are based on fewer than 1,000 user reviews. Some have low ratings from the BBB that are worth taking a look at before making your decision or do not have a BBB page due to location. Important caveats:TheBetter Business Bureauis not affiliated with any government agency and does not rate companies outside of North America. To be BBB Accredited, companies pay a fee to the organization. TrustPilot, meanwhile, also offers a paid tier that provides companies more interaction with their user ratings. It alsoremoved 2.2 million fake reviewsin 2020. A note on pricing:We've made every effort to verify that the prices listed here were accurate at the time of last publication, but prices in this category are subject to frequent fluctuations and are also consistently subject to special offers and limited deals. Further, many of the prices listed here reflect the monthly rates if you prepay for 12 months of service or are limited-time introductory prices. Please check the vendors in question to verify pricing at any given time. The following Minecraft server hosts have slightly lower or fewer TrustPilot and/or BBB ratings than the ones above. Another of our top web hosting site picks, Hostwinds also offers Minecraft server hosting starting at $5 a month. It has anA+ rating from the BBBand is BBB Accredited, and itsTrustPilot rating is 4.0 out of 5, although it has fewer than 1,000 reviews. Hostwinds' Minecraft hosting starts at $5 a month for one CPU, 1GB of RAM and 30GB of storage. BisectHosting offers 25 different plans, each with an option for a budget or premium package. Budget packages start at $3 a month for 1GB RAM and unlimited NVMe SSD and go up to about $144 a month for 48GB RAM. Premium plans range from $8 a month to about $240 a month, with the same amounts of RAM as their budget counterparts but with more locations and free daily backups, modpack updates, sponge installation and a dedicated IP address. BisectHosting has aB- rating from the BBB, but it also has aTrustPilot rating of 4.7 out of 5with almost 10,000 reviews. Apex Hosting offers Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition servers starting at about $6 a month. It also includes a seven-day money-back guarantee. Apex Minecraft Hosting has anD- rating from the BBB, but itsTrustPilot Rating is 4.2 out of 5. However, the TrustPilot rating is based on just over 600 reviews.

Sparked Host has anA+ BBB ratingand aTrustPilot rating of 4.6 out of 5with more than 1,500 reviews. PebbleHost is home to both Minecraft and other gaming and dedicated servers. It offers budget, premium or extreme plans depending on your needs, starting at $1 per GB a month. PebbleHost is based in the UK and does not have a BBB page, but it has aTrustPilot rating of 4.7 out of 5with more than 3,000 reviews. RAMShard offers nine Minecraft server hosting plans, starting at $3 a month. It has anA+ BBB rating. RAMShard also has aTrustPilot rating of 4.0 out of 5but with fewer than 500 reviews. Former CNET editor Dawnthea Price Lisco contributed to this report. Hostinger is the best Minecraft server host, with excellent server performance during our hands-on test and a4.6 out of five star Trustpilot rankingbased on over 30,000 reviews. The amount of RAM you need for a Minecraft server depends on the number of players you'll have. You'll need 1GB for 1-4 players, 2GB for 5-10 players and more RAM for larger servers. Two CPU cores may be enough to run a small Minecraft server. Many experts recommend using more cores, especially if you plan to have more than a few players on your server.","Choose the best Minecraft server host for your gaming needs.

427,iOS 18.2: The Latest Apple Intelligence Features and More on Your iPhone,"The wait is over for some of the most anticipatedApple Intelligence features. Apple releasediOS 18.2on Dec. 11, and the update brings a whole host of AI to your iPhone -- if you have a compatible one.Genmoji,Visual IntelligenceandChatGPT integrated Siriare just a few of the new features you'll see on your iPhone if you haveiPhone 15 Pro, Pro Maxor a device from theiPhone 16 lineup. Even if you have another iPhone, you'll still get new features, like an update to yourMailapp. Read more:An Expert's Guide to iOS 18 You can download the update by going toSettings > General > Software Update, tappingUpdate Nowand following the prompts on your screen. Here are some of the features that landed on your iPhone with iOS 18.2. Note that before you use Apple Intelligence, you have to request it for your iPhone. To do so, go toSettings > Apple Intelligence & Siriand tapGet Apple Intelligence. Apple announced at WWDC in May that its virtual assistant Siri was soon entering a ""new era"" thanks to Apple Intelligence enhancements. And Apple is bringing most of those enhancements to some iPhones with iOS 18.2. With Apple Intelligence, instead of seeing a logo pop up on your screen when you activate Siri, you'll see a glowing light around your screen. You can use Siri like you normally would, and you can also accessChatGPTfor your queries. Whenever you're using an AI chatbot, remember that results may not be accurate and may vary even if you ask the same question twice. I asked Siri to use ChatGPT to show me how to brew a cup of coffee, and at first, it wrote out a seven-step process on how to make drip coffee in a standard brewer. Those instructions were a little wonky, telling me to measure out my water and coffee grounds before grinding my coffee beans. Another time, I asked the same thing and Siri gave me a five-step process, which was more accurate. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of these ChatGPT requests that reads, ""Check important info for mistakes."" You can also copy what Siri and ChatGPT show you by tapping a button in the top right corner of the window that shows two pieces of paper. Then, you can paste the response in a message or a note if you want -- but again, you should verify the details of your request. Read more:ChatGPT Gets Integrated Into Siri With iOS 18.2 There areover 3,000 emojiyou can use, but sometimes you can't find the one you really want.Genmojiis here to help. With the Apple IntelligenceGenmojifeature, you can describe the emoji you're looking for and iPhones with Apple Intelligence will attempt to generate a new emoji based on your description. To use Genmoji, go into a message and tap the emoji keyboard in the bottom left corner of your keyboard. Then, type the emoji you're looking for into the search bar. If there isn't an emoji that matches your description, tapCreate New Emojijust below the search bar. Your iPhone will then show you a few variations of what it came up with based on your description. You can swipe through the emoji, and when you find a Genmoji you like, tapAddin the top right corner to permanently add that new emoji to your keyboard. Read more:How to Create Custom Emoji With Genmoji and AI This is Apple's answer to Google Lens.Visual Intelligenceis an Apple Intelligence feature that lets you point your camera at something, like a dog, and your iPhone will then use the photo to search online to help you identify it. The feature can also be used to detect phone numbers to create contacts, scan QR codes and translate languages. You can also integrate this feature with ChatGPT to help you identify items, as well as to help you better understand what's on a page or screen. Note that you don't need a ChatGPT account to use the integration. This feature is also only available on the iPhone 16 lineup since it utilizes the series' new camera control side-button. If you have one of the new iPhones, long press the new side-button where the SIM card tray used to be to quickly pull up Visual Intelligence. ""The camera control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. It allows you to adjust various camera features simply by sliding your finger,"" Apple said at its Glowtime event in September. ""Its convenient design ensures it's always within reach."" This Apple Intelligence feature takes Genmoji one step further and lets you create whole images based on text prompts in a tool calledImage Playground. This feature is a standalone app and it can also be found in Message by tapping the plus (+) button to the left of your text box. Image Playground is filled with prompt suggestions, themes, places and more to get you started. You can enter multiple prompts to make the image more specific, but once I entered seven prompts a popup appeared telling me to use fewer. There's also an option to change the art style from the default cartoony 3D images to illustrations. If you want to put yourself, friends, family or your pet into one of these images, you can. Tap the plus (+) sign in the bottom right corner and then tap eitherChoose PhotoorTake Photo. You'll still have to choose or enter a prompt in addition to the photo. The feature can create some simple images, and it can be unintentionally funny with how weird other images are. In one instance, I selected the prompts astronaut, artist and lighthouse. One of the results showed an astronaut leaning against what I Imagine is an invisible stool while painting a multicolor beach scene. But for some reason there's a lighthouse just floating in the background. Phenomenal work. You can also draw a sketch in Notes, select your sketch and then use it with Visual Playground. That way you can either clean up your sketch, or if -- like me -- you're not an artist, you can use the feature to flesh out your sketch. Read more:Everything You Need to Know About Image Playground The Find My app can be used to locate things like your AirPods and MacBook, and with iOS 18.2, Apple makes it easy for everyone to get help finding lost items. If you go intoFind My > Itemsand tap one of your items, you have two new options:Share Item LocationandShow Contact Info. If you enableShare Item Location, Find My will create a link that you can share with others so they can notify you if they find your lost or missing item. This could be especially helpful as we head into the holidays as more people are traveling and losing luggage at airports or leaving items behind. These links expire after one week, though, which may not be enough time to find them. If you enable Show Contact Info, others can connect to lost items so they can find ways to contact you and bring your item back to you. The Mail app on every iPhone also gets an upgrade in iOS 18.2. Apple announced in September that Mail would soon be able to sort emails to multiple categories to keep your important emails in one place and ads or promotions in another, like Gmail and Outlook do. The new layout keeps things mostly tidy, but Mail doesn't always get it right. For example, I found an email for digital tickets I previously ordered in the Promotions category rather than the Primary category. You don't have to use the new layout if you don't want to. To change your Mail layout back, go into Mail, tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner and tapList View. Read more:What to Know About Mail Categories and How to Disable Them Apple previously removed the volume slider on the iPhone's lock screen. You could still use the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone, but it wasn't as precise as the slider. With iOS 18.2, you can add the slider back to your lock screen. Go toSettings > Accessibility > Audio and Visualand tap the toggle next toAlways Show Volume Control. Now, whether you're listening to a podcast or music from one of Apple's apps or a third-party app the volume slider will be present on your lock screen. If you have kids who like to play games or watch videos on their iPhones and they set the music to full blast, that could damage their device's speakers -- not to mention that it could be annoying to you. But iOS 18.2 lets set a maximum volume limit on an iPhone. To set a limit go toSettings > Sounds & Haptics > Volume Limitand tap the toggle next toLimit Maximum Volume. A scale will appear and you can select what you want the limit to be. Apple does note that this limit doesn't apply to things like phone calls, FaceTime calls, emergency calls or Find My sounds. If you like using another messaging or email apps, like Signal or Gmail, over Apple's native apps, you can change your default apps to those other apps in iOS 18.2. Go toSettings > Apps > Default Appsand then you can change which apps your iPhone uses automatically for sending messages, emails, browsing the web and more. Apple launchedApple News Plus in 2019. Since then the tech company has made some changes to its news aggregator service, like the addition of theQuartilespuzzles. With iOS 18.2, Apple is bringing Sudoku to Apple News Plus subscribers. If you subscribe to Apple News Plus ($13 a month) go toNews > Following > Puzzlesto play the latest Sudoku puzzle. Every day Apple launches a few of these puzzles, each ranging in difficulty, so there's always a new brain-teaser to play.

428,Meta's Ray-Bans Can Now Do Real-Time Live AI And Translation,"Meta'scamera-equipped Ray-Banshave had a lot of AI features onboard already, but they're getting two more big ones. Always-on continuous AI assistance is arriving onto the glasses starting today for owners whohave early accessto Meta's features, as well as onboard translation. Both these features were demoed by Mark Zuckerberg at Meta's Connect developer conferenceearlier this year. The features involve continuous audio and camera recording as opposed to specific individual prompts, allowing the Ray-Bans to be used for an extended period of time with the AI features turned on. Saying ""Meta, start Live AI"" begins the always-on feature. The glasses' LED light stays on when always-on live AI is activated, and Meta keeps a recording of the conversation that can be referred to throughout the AI session. For translation, it should work automatically while talking, with the translation coming in via the glasses with a slight delay. The live AI assistance is similar to whatGoogle just demonstratedon its own prototype glasses this month via Gemini and Android XR, arriving next year. The always-on AI takes a hit on battery life: expect 30 minutes of use before needing a recharge, according to Meta. But this type of always-on camera-assisted AI is exactly what more tech companies are going to be exploring in the next year. I'll follow up with impressions when I get a chance to test it for myself.","Continuous AI assistance through always-on cameras, plus translation, are coming to Meta's ever-evolving AI-equipped glasses.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/metas-ray-bans-can-now-do-real-time-live-ai-and-translation/,
429,Blackmagic's $30K Apple Vision Pro Immersive Camera Is Coming Early Next Year,"Apple's$3,500 Vision Proheadset can play back videos in a high-res 3D Immersive Video format, and now there's a $30,000 pro camera that can shoot videos for it. Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive Camera, touted as the first official pro camera that can shoot in Apple's Immersive Video format, officially costs $29,995 and will be shipping by ""late Q1 2025,"" but preorders are opening up today onBlackmagic's website. The camera was announced at Apple'sWWDC developer conferenceearlier this year alongside VisionOS 2. The Cine Immersive camera's specs are imposing: 8,160x7,200-pixel resolution per eye, capable of recording 90fps 180-degree 8K video for Vision Pro with 16 stops of dynamic range with dual camera sensors. The camera comes with 8TB of onboard storage and 10G Ethernet support for cloud-syncing to Blackmagic's servers. Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve Studio, the software that you'll need to edit this Immersive Video footage, will get an update next year alongside the camera. While this camera isn't in any way intended for your average consumer, it's the upper range pro camera that could spark more pro video production for Apple's hardware, as the Vision Pro aims to pivot to being a more affordable/mainstream device in the next few years. Right now, there are still very few immersive-format videos in Apple's own catalog for Vision Pro, although some early effortslook pretty amazing. The amount of available video content has to increase to make the whole proposition more appealing. Blackmagic's pro camera, which appears to be far more portable than the earlier immersive cameras Apple used in some of its shoots, looks like a start -- but for anyone else, shooting basic 3D videos on iPhones will be the way to go until something like this becomes available at a smaller scale.","The pro camera, announced earlier this year, can shoot in 3D Immersive Video format for Apple's Vision headset.

430,T-Mobile and SpaceX's Starlink Prep for Beta Test of Satellite Cellphone Service,"T-Mobile and SpaceX have taken another step towards enabling satellite connectivity for T-Mobile's wireless users. On Monday, the two companies announced that they have opened up registration for T-Mobile Starlink, their joint program that allows T-Mobile users to connect to SpaceX's Starlink satellites to gain connectivity in areas where there isn't terrestrial wireless coverage. T-Mobile says thebeta program is freefor all ""postpaid voice customers with a compatible device"" and will allow for texting using satellites to start when it kicks off ""in early 2025."" The carrier says that voice and data support will be ""coming in the future."" The carrier is expecting to launch the commercial version of the service ""sometime in 2025"", and it is unclear if it will charge users then for the connectivity or if it will limit access or features to customers with specific wireless plans. ""In time, T-Mobile Starlink is expected to work with the phone in your pocket,"" the carrier told CNET when asked about which phones would be compatible for the beta. ""During the beta test phase, we are optimizing the experience on select devices and will continue to test and extend to as many devices as possible with time we'll provide more details about the optimized phones and share them closer to our T-Mobile Starlink beta launch."" ""T-Mobile Starlink is the first major low-earth orbit constellation in the world paired with terrestrial cellular spectrum, making the phone in your pocket work in areas of the U.S. that have never, and probably never will, have ground based coverage,"" Mike Katz, T-Mobile's president of marketing, strategy and products said in a statement. ""It's a truly groundbreaking engineering breakthrough and means that we are one step closer to helping T-Mobile customers have confidence that, no matter where they are, if they can see the sky, they will be covered by T-Mobile,"" Katz said. T-Mobile and SpaceXfirst announced their partnership back in 2022combining some of T-Mobile's wireless spectrum with SpaceX's satellites. SpaceXput its first satellites capable of the service into orbit in January of this yearand has has since been building out its constellation of capable Starlink satellites. The two companies actuallyturned on the service as Hurricanes Milton and Helene battered parts of the US in October, with users connected to the service seeing ""T-Mobile SpaceX"" in the network name and their phones displaying ""1 to 2 bars of signal"" strength, according to SpaceX. Last month the Federal Communications Commission gave its approval to SpaceX to use ""all 7,500 satellites in its authorized Gen2 system"" for cell coverage. It has yet to approve its plan for additional satellites, including ""the remaining 22,488 satellites"" the company would like to deploy for the service. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has previously posted on X that the company will exclusively partner with T-Mobile on the service forat least the first year. T-Mobile rivals AT&T and Verizon have previously announced theirown plans for satellite connectivity through AST SpaceMobile, with Verizon previously announcing plans to working withAmazon's Project Kuiperback in 2021. Verizon is also working withsatellite provider Skyloto enable texting on Android phones. (iPhone 14 and later Apple phones, regardless of carrier,are able to use satellites for iMessage texting with iOS 18.)

432,Here's How to Improve the Photos App on iOS 18 (and Fix Other Annoying New Features),"I've been aniPhoneuser since Apple launched thevery first model back in 2007, and I'm still an iPhone user all these years later. Currently I've got theiPhone 15 Pro Max(waiting to update to theiPhone 17). But I can still acknowledge that, even after all this time, the mobile operating software that powers the iPhone isn't completely flawless. In fact, every new update brings at least a few features or settings that don't work with the way I use my phone. That's true of the latest update,iOS 18. Read more:7 iOS 18 Features Every iPhone User Should Change Now Don't get me wrong. There's a lot to enjoy in iOS 18. For instance, I'm a big fan of the newRCS support, which makes text messaging with Android users much better. I like that I can also sendtext messages via satellitewhen I don't have cell service. And I'm happy that I can finallyswap out the two lock screen buttons(which frankly, we should've been able to do for awhile). Also, iOS 18.2 finally bringsChatGPT to Siriand lets youcreate your own emoji using generative AI. Don't miss:iOS 18.2 Brings Major Upgrades to Apple Intelligence. Here's How to Download It on Your iPhone But then there are also things I hate about the latest iOS 18 update -- as always. If you're like me, you're bound to dislike parts of iOS 18, so here are three new features I like the least in iOS 18, and how you can kinda fix them. For more, check out thenine hidden iOS 18 features you should definitely know about. OK, I'll straight out say it, I really don't like the overhaul that Apple has given the Photos app on iOS 18. I understand what it's going for, but it feels awfully cluttered by default. I don't want my main camera roll constantly reminding me of vacations or suggestions for wallpapers with photos and videos I'm not looking for. Fortunately, Apple does give you the option to customize the Photos app to your heart's desire. When you open the Photos app for the first time, you'll see a grid of all your photos and videos, which is the library view you're used to, but at the bottom, you'll notice the navigation bar is gone, and instead replaced with collections for photos and videos you've taken recently and have of friends, family and pets. This is what the camera roll looks like now on iOS 18. If you swipe down, you'll continue to see random collections and albums, like pinned collections, shared albums, memories, trips, featured photos and wallpaper suggestions, all of which used to live in the Albums and For You tabs. Now they're all in one place on iOS 18, which is the main view. And while that may be useful to some, I don't need to see all of it at once. I just want to see my camera roll and some albums. To customize the Photos app, swipe all the way down to the bottom and tapCustomize and Reorder. Here you can uncheck any collections you wish to hide from the main view. You can also organize the order in which they appear. I don't want wallpaper suggestions and most of the other options, so I unchecked everything but Media Types(organizes your media into videos, live photos, etc.) andUtilities(albums for hidden, recently deleted, receipts, documents and so on). You can remove or keep as many collections and albums as you like, but for me, the less the better. Of course, you'll no longer be able to see the collections that Apple has created for you, and several other albums as well, but if you don't use them, you're better off this way, because you can still find any photo or video you want by going through your camera roll or using the search button at the top. This is what my camera roll looks like after I removed all the clutter. I use the Control Center all the time, to quickly connect to Wi-FI, enable Do Not Disturb, turn on dark mode or low battery mode and discover new songs with the music recognition control. However, with iOS 18, Apple expanded how the Control Center is designed, and it now has multiple pages of controls, some premade and others you can create yourself. The things is, I don't need multiple Control Center pages -- I just need the one. I don't want the clutter of multiple pages, because I can fit all the controls I need on a single page. But that's not the only issue. I also find that when I now try to swipe out of the Control Center, I end up accidentally scrolling through the Control Center pages, and so I get stuck...and annoyed. Above you can see the normal Control Center(left)and the new pages(middle and right). As luck has it, there's an easy way to get the Control Center to look like it used to, with only a single page. In the Control Center, which you can access by swiping down from the top-right of your screen, swipe up to access the additional pages and press your finger down on any blank part of the page. This will highlight the control -- hit the remove control button (-) at the top-left to get rid of the control and the page. Do this for any other extra Control Center pages you have, until you only have the main Control Center. Once you remove the extra Control Center pages, you'll no longer see the page icons on the center-left. Now when you try to swipe out from the Control Center, you'll no longer get stuck in the other pages. Instead, you'll be able to easily exit like before. The big AI upgrade to Siri that everyone's been waiting is out now, with the release ofiOS 18.2. Instead of the Siri orb that you're used to, the edges of your iPhone screen glow with various colors when the assistant is listening to you. It's a welcome design change, but one aspect of the new ChatGPT-powered Siri keeps annoying me. If you double tap at the bottom center of your iPhone, the Type to Siri feature appears. This allows you to type, instead of speak, to Siri, bringing up a keyboard at the bottom of your screen. It's a useful feature if you're in a situation where you need to be discreet, but I always seem to enable the feature by accident, especially when I'm tapping or swiping around my phone. There is a way to disable Type to Siri though, without completely disabling the assistant. InSettings, go toApple Intelligence & Siri>Talk & Type to Siriand toggle offType to Siri. Siri won't get AI capabilities until next year.

433,Premier League Soccer: Livestream Bournemouth vs. West Ham From Anywhere,"West Ham will look to further ease the pressure on under-pressure manager Julen Lopetegui as they go in search of a win away against an impressive Bournemouth team in the English Premier League. Lopetegui's role at West Ham remains in the balance, despite last Monday's vital 2-1 win at home against struggling Wolves. A second consecutive EPL victory today against one of the league's in-form teams would go a long way to lifting the uncertainty over the Spanish coach's job. A win would give the Hammers a comfortable 9-point buffer between them and the relegation zone. Hosts Bournemouth, meanwhile, could go as high as fifth with a win this evening, having won each of their last three EPL matches. Bournemouth take on West Ham on Monday, Dec. 16, at the Vitality Stadium, with kickoff set for8 p.m. GMTlocal time, making it a3p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PTstart in the US and Canada and a7a.m. AEDTkickoff in Australia in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Below, we'll outline the bestlive TV streaming servicesto use to watch the match as it happens, wherever you are in the world. England winger Jarrod Bowen has four goals and four assists in 15 appearances for West Ham this season. Monday's Bournemouth vs. West Ham match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at theNBC Sports websitewith a valid login. It can also be streamed via Sling TV and other, more expensive streaming TV services. Sling TV's Blue plan includes USA Network, making it a great option for fans wanting to watch Premier League action. It's $40 a month and features over 40 channels, including other sports channels like ESPN and FS1. Read our Sling TV review. If you find yourself unable to view EPL matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the games -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions. ExpressVPN isour current best VPN pickfor people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with codeSPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. This Monday night clash is exclusive to Sky Sports, showing on its Sky Sports Main Event, Premier League and UHD channels. If you already have Sky Sports as part of your TV package, you can stream the game via its Sky Go app, but cord-cutters will want to get set up with a Now account and a Now Sports membership to stream the game. Sky subsidiary Now offers streaming access to Sky Sports channels with a Now Sports membership. You can get a day of access for £15, or sign up to a monthly plan from £35 per month right now. If you want to stream this EPL game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo Canada. The service has exclusive rights to every Premier League fixture once again this season. Fubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season, with exclusive streaming rights to every match. It costs CA$30 per month, although you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually. Football fans down under can watch EPL matches live on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League fixture of the 2024-25 season live in Australia. With exclusive rights to stream all EPL matches live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans. If you're already an Optus network customer, you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 per month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25.",The Hammers look to make it back-to-back wins as they travel to the Vitality Stadium to face the in-form Cherries.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/premier-league-soccer-livestream-bournemouth-vs-west-ham-from-anywhere/,

435,"Apple Is Planning Giant, Foldable iPad and Thinner, Folding iPhones, Report Says","Apple is reportedly developing a giant iPad that opens up to the size of two iPad Pros. According to Bloomberg'sPower On newsletteron Sunday, the company has been working on the foldable device for several years and plans to bring it to market around 2028. The largest current size iPad is 13 inches, but to make playing games and viewing shows and movies better, the screen on the rumored model would open wider and fold when not in use, making it easier to carry. Microsoft and Lenovo have attempted similar concepts in the past with limited success. Apple's approach, however, intends to have the larger-size option look like it's one piece of glass rather than two displays side by side. Bloomberg said early Apple prototypes have shown a ""nearly"" invisible crease on the giant iPad, but the company aims to remove it entirely. Samsung has long tried to lessen the crease of its foldable phones, theGalaxy FoldandGalaxy Flip, without much progress. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The report comes as Apple remains the only major smartphone manufacturer without a foldable device. The company has faced challenges related to the hinge and display screen protection, according to theWall Street Journal. Foldable phones still only amount to a small segment of the market but areprojectedto experience significant growth in the next few years, especially if Apple jumps on the bandwagon. Apple is also reportedly working on a foldable iPhone, but that wouldn't launch until at least 2026, according to Bloomberg. At the same time, Apple is expected to launch a thinner iPhone next year.",The company aims to remove the display's crease entirely -- an accomplishment rival foldable devices have yet to master.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-reportedly-planning-giant-foldable-ipad-thinner-folding-iphones/,
436,Best VPN for Windows 2024,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. What to look for in a VPN for Windows  Internet speed loss All VPNs slow down your internet somewhat based on encrypting your data first by sending it through secure servers. The fastest VPNs only slow your internet download speed down by a maximum of 25% or less, which should be unnoticeable on a reliable connection. Privacy Look for AES-256-bit encryption with OpenVPN and IKEv2, or ChaCha20 over WireGuard. We also recommend a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a strict no-logs policy that's been audited by a reputable third party. Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider that publishes regular transparency reports and has jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing alliances. Server network Think about the total number of servers and the individual countries in which a VPN provider maintains a presence. At the high end, frequent international travelers and folks who want to unblock tons of foreign Netflix libraries should look for thousands of servers spread across around 100 or more countries. Around 60-plus countries should suffice for many people. Device support Most VPN providers offer Windows apps. Additionally, you'll typically find MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iPhone, iPad and Fire TV apps. Many VPN providers support routers and browser plugins, and a growing number also include Apple TV apps. Streaming capabilities Because of their ability to make it look like you're in another city, state or even country, VPNs can be helpful for streaming region-restricted content like foreign Netflix libraries. Think about the streaming services you want to watch and make sure your VPN provider unblocks those in the countries you need it to. Cost Most VPN providers let you sign up for a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year subscription. Expect to pay anywhere from $5 to $15 per month, $40 to $100 per year or $60-plus for a two-or-more year package. A two+ year plan usually scores you the most savings, but we recommend sticking to an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. Privacy protection and transparency SCORE ExpressVPNis CNET’s pick for the best VPN for Windows, and best VPN overall. We appreciate ExpressVPN’s user-friendly Windows app -- and software for other platforms like MacOS, Android and iOS. ExpressVPN even runs onCopilot+ ARM-based computers, making it an excellent VPN for all of your Windows machines. Whether you’re a VPN expert or have never used one before, Express remains intuitive to use yet feature-rich. The veteran VPN provider consistently demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy and transparency while remainingexcellent for streaming. ExpressVPN’s speeds, although fast enough for most online activities, aren't quite as fast asthose of some of its competitors, based on our latest speed tests. In 2024, CNET Labs measured a 24.8% average speed loss with ExpressVPN. We saw substantially better speeds from NordVPN (11.1% speed loss) and Surfshark (17%), but ExpressVPN’s speeds were largely consistent and aligned with our expectations across protocols and server locations. Although we recommend OpenVPN for seriously privacy-concerned users, Express' blazing-fast 15% average speed loss with Lightway on Windows is great for more data-intensive activities like streaming, gaming and videoconferencing. ExpressVPN says it collects no logs, a claim bolstered by a2023 no-logs audit by KPMG. In July 2024, ExpressVPN published itslatest transparency reportoutlining the number of requests its legal team received -- but because of its zero-log policy that's been verified, there was no information to share. In addition to its transparency efforts, ExpressVPN’s privacy protections are top-notch and forward-thinking. The provider recently upgraded its proprietary open-source Lightway VPN protocol with Quantum Protection to help guard against future threats from quantum computers, along with encryption enhancements to better protect against threats like eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. ExpressVPN’s TrustedServer technology elevates the protections of the traditional RAM-only server architecture by reinstalling the entire software stack with every reboot. In addition to its VPN service, Express's annual plan bundles an ad/tracker blocker, password manager, identity alerts and identity theft insurance. The two-year plan adds data removal service. You'll get eight simultaneous connections with ExpressVPN, which is slightly less generous than NordVPN’s 10 simultaneous connections but considerably less than the unlimited simultaneous connections allowed by others like Surfshark, PIA andIPVanish. For the best, you’ll need to pay a premium: ExpressVPN is one of the most expensive VPN providers currently on the market. The service costs $13 per month, $100 for the first year (then $117 per year) or $140 total for two years of service (then $150 per year), which is considerably more expensive than the $15 per month, $48 for the first year (with four extra months) or $56 total for the first two years (with four extra months) thatSurfsharkcharges (the one- and two-year plans renew at $60 annually).NordVPNis slightly cheaper than ExpressVPN upfront at $13 per month, $60 annually or $83 total for two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $140 per year). If you’re not satisfied with the service, you can request your money back within 30 days of your purchase. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfsharkboasts an impressive suite of privacy and security features, unlimited simultaneous connections, an easy-to-use interface and an expansive global network. It's also still significantly cheaper than most of its competitors making it the best VPN for Windows you can get on a budget. Along with standard VPN features such as akill switch and DNS leak protection, some of the more notable Surfshark amenities include camouflage mode (which hides the fact that you're using a VPN), split-tunneling, NoBorders mode (which lets you use Surfshark in regions where VPNs are restricted) and multihop VPN connections. You'll also get access to Surfshark's CleanWeb technology, which blocks ads and malware and helps you avoid phishing attacks. We were pleased to see Surfshark introduce its first transparency report in August -- a step in the right direction for the service. One innovation we particularly appreciate is Surfshark’s Nexus network, which connects the VPN's entire network of servers and allows you to choose multiple servers to route your connection through. The functionality is somewhat similar toTor, but Surfshark says it's faster. With its Dynamic MultiHop, IP Randomizer and IP Rotator functions, the Nexus network can give you a few extra layers of protection while you use the VPN, which can be especially beneficial to users withcritical privacy needs. Surfshark says it doesn't log any user activity. Although no-logging claims are virtuallyimpossible to provewith 100% certainty, Surfshark passed athird-party no-logs auditby Deloitte. Surfshark rates consistently as one of the fastest VPNs available. We clocked an impressive 17% average speed loss in autumn 2023 tests, just shy of NordVPN’s best-in-class 11%. Surfshark had no problems unblocking Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video content in our tests. Surfshark keeps its prices lower than most other VPNs, making it an outstanding value for annual plans. You’ll pay $15 monthly, $48 for the first year (with four extra months) or $56 total for your first two years (with four extra months). Both the annual and 24-month plans jump to $60 per year for any additional 12-month cycles. Despite its wallet-friendly pricing, we don’t recommend the two-year plan because of how quickly things change in the VPN market. Although Surfshark sports a slew of privacy features, its Fourteen Eyes-intelligence sharing jurisdiction (based in the Netherlands) may disappoint folks with serious security needs, such as investigative journalists or activists. If you're not satisfied with the service for any reason, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPNremains a popular virtual private network option due to its fast connections, privacy-focused features and excellent geo-unblocking for streaming services. Its user-friendly design -- including a polished Windows app -- that doesn't compromise on settings makes it an outstanding choice for casual VPN newcomers and seasoned power users alike. In addition to its x86 Windows app, Nord offers anARM Windows appfor use on devices like the Surface Pro. At $13 per month, $60 annually or $83 total for your first two years, NordVPN sets you back less initially than premium VPNrivals like ExpressVPN, but more than budget-oriented companies like Surfshark and PIA. Subsequent price hikes drive the price to $140 per year, which is notably more expensive than the renewal prices of many other VPN providers. We recommend avoiding an autorenewal with Nord. We appreciate NordVPN's commitment to privacy and security. In addition to features like Onion over VPN (Tor) and a Double VPN, which deliver additional encryption, a2023 audit by Deloittebacked up its no-log claims for improved transparency. Folks with serious privacy needs can even buy a Nord subscription withcryptocurrenciesfor pseudo-anonymity. Though zero-logging policies are challenging to verify with absolute certainty, third-party audits provide peace of mind. On the entertainment side, we had no issues streaming US and UK Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus libraries on most devices. Aside from Windows, Nord runs on virtually any platform you can think of, including MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS, browsers and even Apple TV. NordVPN solidified itself as the fastest VPN in our 2024speed tests, particularly using its proprietary NordLynx protocol (a WireGuard derivative). Using the NordLynx VPN protocol, we clocked an average internet speed loss of just 3.2% with Windows and 12.6% on MacOS. Even its OpenVPN speed loss was a blazing-fast 10.1% average on MacOS and 18.8% on Windows. We do recommend an OpenVPN connection for more privacy-critical users, but you can expect fast speeds either way. NordVPN’s global server network comprises more than 6,800 servers spanning 113 countries after a recent server expansion, keeping its server reach among the best in the VPN world. Overall, NordVPN sports advanced privacy features in an intuitive service, meaning it's the best VPN for Windows for power users seeking reliable internet speeds for streaming and unique privacy features. The only free plan we recommend SCORE ProtonVPNis one of the few free VPNs we recommend, and it boasts an outstanding paid tier as well. The no-cost option provides access to servers in five countries, unlimited monthly usage and excellent privacy. While you can't choose a server -- you're automatically shuffled onto one -- and there's only support for one device, Proton's zero-dollar plan doesn't plaster your screen with ads or sell your data. Its premium package has 9,300-plus servers in 112 countries, outstanding streaming service unblocking for sites like Netflix and 10 simultaneous connections -- the same as NordVPN, more than ExpressVPN but lower than the unlimited allowance that Surfshark and PIA provide. The Swiss-based VPN company Proton prioritizes privacy with its privacy-friendly jurisdiction, open-source apps and strict no-logs policy that's been audited. Additionally, it offers a Stealth VPN protocol alongside OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. The Stealth protocol is better at bypassing firewalls or other VPN-blocking programs than other VPN protocols, making it harder to determine that you're using a VPN. Proton VPN's Stealth protocol can be useful for situations where you're trying to stream videos from a service that doesn't nice with virtual private networks, or you're in a location that frowns upon VPNs -- like onschool Wi-Fior in certain countries. Because of its Stealth VPN protocol on Windows support, reader-friendly privacy policy, privacy-friendly jurisdiction and top-notch transparency, Proton is one of the best Windows VPNs for privacy-conscious users. If you're a political activist, investigative journalist, asylum-seeker or paranoid torrenter, Proton VPN is a compelling virtual private network solution. Even if you're more concerned about unblocking foreign Netflix libraries, Proton is still an outstanding choice. In addition to its traditional Windows app, Proton has a Windors ARM VPN app that works on devices like Snapdragon laptops. Thanks to its MacOS, Android/Android TV, Apple TV, iOS/iPadOS, Fire TV and Linux GUI apps, Proton isn't just a solid Windows VPN -- it's a terrificmulti-device VPN. ExpressVPNis the best VPN for Windows overall with its fast speeds, effective unblocking of streaming services and unmatched transparency. It has user-friendly apps on Windows and all other platforms, an extensive server network plus cutting-edge security features. ExpressVPN is even one of the fewVPNs that runs on Copilot Plus PCswith ARM processors, making it a great choice for all kinds of Windows machines. Surfsharkis the best value VPN for Windows, offering unlimited simultaneous connections -- which let you use your VPN on Windows laptops or desktops and a slew of other devices -- alongside a solid suite of privacy features without breaking the bank. It's also among the fastest VPNs we benchmarked. Whether you want to stream movies and shows on apps like Netflix in 4K or bolster your privacy, Surfshark has you covered. NordVPNis the fastest Windows VPN because of its best-in-class 11% average speed loss, meaning you can stream buttery smooth movies in 4K or download PC games with little to no lag. ItsWindows for ARM supportmeans you can install the NordVPN app on devices like the Surface Pro. With Nord, you'll also enjoy advanced privacy features and outstanding geographically restricted content unblocking. Proton VPNis the best free VPN and the only no-cost virtual private network we recommend. With its Stealth protocol that masks your VPN usage for circumventing censorship or VPN restrictions -- which is now on Windows -- Proton is a great virtual private network option for folks with strict privacy needs. Plus, Proton supports x86 and ARM Windows devices, so you can install it on virtually any computer you want to. The free tier is solid, while the paid plan boasts a massive international server network and outstanding streaming support for unblocking region-restricted content, like foreign Netflix libraries. A virtual private network offers enhanced privacy, lets you unblock geo-restricted content like foreign Netflix libraries and allows you to circumvent throttling restrictions or censorship. Because of the massive popularity of Microsoft's Windows operating system, most VPN providers offer Windows VPN apps for your desktop orlaptop. With a VPN on your Windows rig, you can unblock region-restricted streaming content likeout-of-market NFL gamesorforeign Netflix libraries, torrent privately and bypass throttling or censorship restrictions. Our CNET experts extensivelytesteda slew of virtual private networks on Windows 11 and Windows 10 to determine the best VPNs for Windows. We looked at several factors, including streaming service unblocking, internet speeds, connection reliability, privacy, ease of use andvalue for the money. During our hands-on analysis, we used each VPN's Windows app to make sure it delivered useful features in an intuitive package. Because most folks have multiple devices, we tested on non-Windows machines as well. If you're working with a slightly older device, be sure to read our guide onhow to set up a VPN on Windows 10. Whether you're setting it up for the first time or reinstalling it, here'show to download Windows 11. There's much to think about when selecting a virtual private network, including device support, privacy features, internet speeds and price. Here are the main factors to mull over when picking the best VPN for Windows. Device compatibility Most VPNs offer an app for Windows. Chances are you've got other devices, including phones, tablets and streaming devices that you want to install a VPN on. You'll find Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS/iPadOS apps from nearly every VPN provider, but certain platforms such as Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and a Linux graphical user interface app are rarer. If you've got an ARM-based Windows device, like the Microsoft Surface Pro, you may want to consider a VPN provider with Windows ARM support. Providers like NordVPN, Proton VPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN and PIA offer ARM apps. Think about the non-Windows gadgets you want to use a VPN with and make sure your desired provider has an app. Privacy Privacy is one of the main reasons to use a VPN. At a minimum, we recommend AES 256-bit encryption (for the OpenVPN and IKEv2VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (WireGuard), a kill switch and a strict no-log policy. No-logging claims are tough to verify with absolute certainty -- you can and should be skeptical -- but it adds peace of mind. Third-party audits improve transparency while backing up no-log assertions. You may find split tunneling -- which lets you use a VPN for some applications but not others -- useful. For instance, you can stream The Jetty on BBC iPlayer from outside of the UK with a VPN while downloading Red Dead Redemption II on Steam without hurting your download speeds. Internet speed loss AllVPNs somewhat slow down your internetdownload and upload speeds because your data doesn't merely travel through your internet service provider's servers, but instead tunnels through your VPN provider's server for encryption. Some companies feature faster speeds than others. Thefastest VPNsdeliver minimal speed loss of 25% or less, which is ideal for bandwidth-intensive activities like 4K video streaming, uploading videos to YouTube and competitive online gaming. Server network A robust server network lets you find an ideal connection. You'll want a high number of servers and a large list of individual countries. A VPN company with fewer overall servers but more standalone countries might work better for travel because you've got a broader selection of nations to pick from. The best VPNs for Windows, including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark and Proton VPN, offer 100 or more servers. Content unblocking Aside from privacy, many folks use VPNs to circumvent regional restrictions. Whether that's unblocking streaming content, like accessing UK Netflix libraries in the US or avoiding annoying but necessary CAPTCHAs while traveling abroad, a VPN has you covered. For streaming, you'll want to ensure your VPN works with your desired services, likeNetflix, Disney Plus, Hulu orAmazon Prime Video. That way, you canwatch your Netflix movies or shows from abroad with a VPNso you can get your Host Frosty or Bridgerton fix from anywhere in the world. Some services, like Netflix and Disney Plus, let you access foreign content libraries, and country-specific streaming services may be unblocked from abroad. For instance, you can stream out-of-market NFL games using a VPN to make it look like you're in a different location. You may even be able tosave money streaming with a VPN. Customer support Especially if you're new to VPNs, a robust section of help guides and frequently asked questions lets you get help more easily. We appreciate companies with detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting tips. For more advanced assistance, 24/7 live chat online or over the phone is great whether you're having connectivity problems or have billing questions. Price A VPN sets you back anywhere from $10 monthly to $100 annually. Generally, you'll save by purchasing a year-long subscription, with greater discounts on two- or three-year purchases. Despite the lower cost, we recommend avoiding a multi-year plan because of how fast things change in the VPN realm. Your provider might offer fast speeds and excellent privacy features at the onset, but it could suffer a data breach or get acquired by a shady company. For the best value with the least risk, stick with annual plans. At the high end, companies charge $90 to $100 per year, while a good value VPN runs you around $40 to $60 annually. Commonly, companies provide sweet introductory prices for your first year of service, then hike the price. If you renew during a sale -- like around Black Friday or Cyber Monday -- you might still get a great deal. Here at CNET, we've spent yearscomprehensively reviewing various VPN providers. To pick the best VPNs for Windows, we ran over 250 internet speed tests per VPN provider, checked for DNS leaks and compared server networks. Additionally, we analyzed pricing to determine overall value, streamed geo-protected content and pored over privacy features. Specifically for Windows, we tested apps on Microsoft's operating system to see what features each offers. We also assessed VPN apps on other platforms, including MacOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TV OS, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and Apple TV so as to address yourmultidevice VPN needs. Private Internet Accessis a wallet-friendly VPN provider. It sets you back just $12 per month, $40 per year or $79 every three years. We like PIA's open-source apps and great transparency with its third-party no-logging audits. PIA packs AES 256-bit encryption on OpenVPN or ChaCha20 with WireGuard, a kill switch, obfuscation and multihop connections. Its 35,000 servers peppering 91 countries make Private Internet Accessgreat for international travel. On the entertainment side, we effortlessly streamed from Disney Plus and Netflix using US and UK servers. Amazon Prime Video gave us some issues on PCs, but it worked on streaming devices including the AmazonFire TV, Android TV and Apple TV. We clocked a disappointingly high 49% average internet speed download loss in our testing. For reference, 20% internet speed loss or less is largely unnoticeable. If you've got reasonably quick connectivity (at least 100Mbps), you might be blissfully unaware of PIA's uneven server performance. Folks with slower speeds, like satellite internet users, should consider one of thefastest VPNs, like NordVPN. PIA is a superb budget pick as one of the best cheap VPNs for Windows, but we recommend Surfshark instead because it's faster and more feature-rich. Read our PIA review. ExpressVPN is CNET's current top pick for the best Windows VPN -- it even runs on Copilot Plus ARM-based Windows PCs. The industry veteran has an impressive network of servers worldwide and provides a solid balance of speed, security and unblocking power. Yes, you can get a free VPN for Windows, and Proton VPN is the only no-cost option we recommend. Proton's free tier doesn't plaster your screen with ads or collect and sell your data -- you don't even have bandwidth limitations. We don't recommend most free VPNs for a couple of reasons. First, free VPNs need to make money somehow -- which most of the time involves selling your data to third parties. Some have even been found to be infected with malware. Besides being risky to use, free VPNs also generally lack the features and performance you'd want from your VPN service. You'll typically have to contend with slow speeds, data caps, weak security, limited server locations and erratic unblocking capabilities with free VPNs. The best way totry a VPN for freeis to take advantage of free trials and money-back guarantees offered by premium VPN providers. If you're on a budget, you can also check out CNET's list of thebest cheap VPN services. Proton VPN is the best free VPN and the only zero-dollar virtual private network we suggest using. It doesn't include any ads, there's no data aggregation and you don't have bandwidth limits. Proton's VPN free tier does have a few restrictions -- you can't manually select a server, for instance -- but on the whole, it's a fantastic no-cost service. Proton VPN offers its Stealth protocol on Windows, which makes it harder for websites, apps or ISPs to determine that you're using a VPN -- which can be helpful in situations where VPNs are frowned upon, like circumventing censorship, streaming from apps that don't support VPNs or using school Wi-Fi. Although there are other 100% free VPNs for Windows PCs, Proton remains one of the few without major downsides, such as data collection, intrusive ads or even being infected with malware. ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN all offer excellent security for Windows users. Each one offers the same AES 256-bit encryption over the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols or ChaCha20 with WireGuard, operates a RAM-only server infrastructure and has been independently audited. Along with crucial security features like a kill switch and DNS leak protection, each of these three VPNs offers additional features that can help enhance your online security and privacy. Surfshark's CleanWeb feature will help you automatically block malware and phishing attempts. NordVPN offers Tor over VPN, double VPN and dark web monitoring features. In addition to ensuring data is never stored on its servers, ExpressVPN says its TrustedServer technology helps improve security and minimizes vulnerabilities and misconfiguration by loading the most up-to-date software every time a server starts up. You typically won't have to worry about getting into any sort of legal trouble for using a VPN in most parts of the world. You could potentially get in legal trouble for using a VPN if you're in a country such as China, Iran or any other country where VPNs are banned or outlawed. If you're traveling, check the local laws regarding VPN use in the country you're traveling to. Even if the country you're in or traveling to does have restrictions on VPNs, you can hide your VPN use by connecting to an obfuscated server. Doing so disguises your VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic. When you connect to a VPN, your ISP will be able to see that you're connected to a VPN, but it won't be able to see what websites you visit or your browsing history. Your ISP will see timestamps of when you connected to the VPN, the IP address of the VPN server you're connected to and the amount of data you're transmitting. Since the actual traffic is encrypted, your ISP will only be able to see that traffic as a random string of gibberish. If you don't want your ISP to know you're using a VPN, you'll need to connect to an obfuscated server, if offered by your VPN provider.","If you're using Windows 11, here are the best virtual private networks we've tested for you in 2022.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-windows/,
437,Sora's AI Videos Arrive as Musk Pitches Image Tool for Making Memes,"If OpenAI gets it right,Sora, the AI tool announced in February that's able to create photorealistic and high-quality video from simple text prompts, will upend the way video is created, with professional video creatives andHollywood filmmakersamong those expected to most feel its effect on their industry. Now those creatives — and anyone with a $20 monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus — can test a version calledSora Turbo, which became available in the US last week (as part of OpenAI's12 daysof announcements). You can write text prompts to create short clips, as well as upload photos and other videos as reference material to go with your prompts. The results are five to 20 seconds long, with resolutions between 480 and 1,080 pixels, and they can be delivered in wide-screen, vertical or square aspect ratios. There are also postgeneration editing features, like storyboard, remix and loop, for more fine-tuning, CNET's Katelyn Chedraouinotes. And though the demos of Sora over the past few months have been impressive — with The Wall Street Journalnotingthat the AI videos ""are good enough to freak us out"" — there are still some glitches to resolve, OpenAI acknowledged in ablog post. ""It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations,"" the post says. Think characters with extra arms and legs. The company is also limiting the testers who can create videos of humans, as it works to ""address concerns about the misappropriation of likeness and deepfakes."" In a nod to the ongoing issues about what training data is being used to feed AI engines (with somepublishersalleging that OpenAI and others have co-opted their copyrighted material without permission),OpenAIwrote that Sora is trained on a ""mix of publicly available data, proprietary data accessed through partnerships, and custom datasets developed in-house,"" including images supplied by humans such as employees. But there are already reports that OpenAI may have trained Sora on unlicensed video-game content (seeTechCrunchandExtremeTech). OpenAI didn't respond to my request for comment on the whole question of video-game content. The Sora news is a reminder that creating visuals with AI is going to be a big deal in the year ahead, with Google (Geminiimage creator) and Meta (AI Studio) also creating image tools to get more users to engage with AI. Elon Musk's xAI last week also announced a photorealistic image editor, code-namedAurora, for its Grok chatbot.Musk, owner of social media platform X, touted Aurora as a way to ""create awesome memes superfast."" As for Sora, OpenAI also acknowledged the need for safety guardrails around the use of tools that may make it easier to createdeepfakes— which it wants others to help it solve for. ""We're introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it's used responsibly as the field advances."" the companywrote. Great, we're crowdsourcing AI safety parameters. I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that. Here are the other doings in AI worth your attention. Back in May, Google CEO Sundar Pichai debuted a bunch of AI tools, saying the company's vision included having its tech do the thinking for you — specifically, by letting Google do all the ""Googling for you"" with features like AI Overviews. I bring this up because the company continues to deliver on that pitch and last week introduced a new version of its Gemini chatbot and a prototype of a tool called Project Mariner, under theblogheadline ""Our new AI model for the agentic era."" What does that mean? ""We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision."" Welcome to the new world ofAI agents. That may include searching out a product for you and finding the best deal, scheduling meetings, interacting with spreadsheets to get answers to complex questions, and even playing games. This new generation of AI tech ""will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,"" Pichai said in the blog post. ""It can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,"" Dennis Hassabis, who oversees Google's DeepMind AI lab, said in aninterviewwith The New York Times. ""It can take action in the world."" Mariner, developed as an extension for Google's Chrome browser, is designed to be used with ""humans in the loop,"" company executives told the NYT. So, though it may fill your online shopping cart with groceries, you still need to press the buy button and make the purchase, they said. Still, the next generation of AI agents from Google, as well as from rivals includingOpenAIandAnthropic, seem destined to bring us closer to a world where AI does more of the work for us. And in many cases, instead of us. If you think you've heard a lot about AI issues, challenges, innovations, products and services in 2024, that's nothing compared with how AI will continue to dominate the conversation in 2025. That's because more people are now trying out chatbots. OpenAI's No. 1 ranked ChatGPT chatbot saw its number of visitors double, to 3.9 billion, in November from the year before,according toSimilarweb. And organizations, spending money on AI tools, continue to work on figuring out how to bring AI into the workplace pragmatically and ethically. So I thought it was worthwhile to call out a few of the reports looking at the state of AI as we head into the New Year. Deloitte's survey of 1,874 early career versus longer-tenured workers highlighted their differing views on AI, with newer workers more excited about how AI could change the workforce for the better. ""Their use of AI is such that one person we interviewed described AI as 'that first person you ask before going to a manager' for feedback and advice,"" the firm found. Deloitte's report ishere. In its 2025 AI Business Predictions, PwCsaysmost workforces will double in 2025 as they ""welcome a host of new members to the team this year: digital workers known as AI agents."" And while there's a lot of talk about which AI chatbots will win marketshare, PwC says having an AI strategy is more important for companies than picking the right large language model. ""There will be many good options. Everyone will be using them. A shrewd strategy will instead emphasize what can set you apart"" in using AI. When it comes to AI and higher education, Pearsonfoundin its survey of more than 1,000 US college students that 58% said gen AI helped them get better grades. Meanwhile, 77% of nearly 3,500 faculty members in the US surveyed said they expect to use ""AI to enhance their teaching methods."" And when it comes to AI and the music industry, the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers, which says it represents more than 5 million creators, conducted aglobal surveyto determine how AI may affect the music industry in the not-too-distant future. It found that gen AI will ""enrich tech companies while substantially jeopardising the income of human creators in the next five years."" In aCNET survey, a quarter of smartphone owners said they don't find AI features helpful, 45% said they're reluctant to pay a monthly subscription fee for AI capabilities, and 34% said they have privacy concerns. Chatterbox Labstested the leading large language models as part of its AI safety research, and after testing them across several categories of harm — fraud; hate speech; illegal activity; misinformation; security and malware; self harm; sexually explicit content; and violence — found that AI models from Anthropic and Amazon ""showed the most progress in AI safety."" Detailed test results can be foundhere. Local readers of the historic Ashland Daily Tidings in Oregon have been duped by scammers who used AI and, in some cases, stolen reporters' identities to produce fake news or AI slop for the newspaper, which shut down in 2023, according to an investigation by the nonprofitOPBmedia org. ""Almost as soon as it closed, a website for the Tidings reemerged, boasting a team of eight reporters ... who cranked out densely reported stories every few days,"" it found. ""The mysterious takeover of a more than 140-year-old news outlet offers a warning of ... what an online future supercharged by the next unregulated wave of technology from Silicon Valley companies may hold for news consumers."" Though ChatGPT is positioning itself as a search engine working with publishers, aTow Center reportfor the Columbia Journalism Review found that ChatGPT may actually misrepresent publishers' content. ""While the company presents inclusion in its search as an opportunity to 'reach a broader audience,' a Tow Center analysis finds that publishers face the risk of their content being misattributed or misrepresented regardless of whether they allow OpenAI's crawlers."" Asked for comment, OpenAI told the center that it's ""collaborated with partners to improve in-line citation accuracy and respect publisher preferences.""",Get up to speed on the rapidly evolving world of AI with our roundup of the week's developments.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/soras-ai-videos-arrive-as-musk-pitches-image-tool-for-making-memes/,
438,"Move Over, Siri and Alexa, AI Agents Are the Digital Assistants We've Wanted","The most advancedphoneson the market come with the promise of making your life easier with new generative AI features, including composing texts, creating images from prompts and removing unwanted people or things from your photos. Now, the tech industry has set its sights on the next generation of artificial intelligence as companies begin to hype up so-calledagentic AI-- in other words, AI agents catering to your needs -- that they say will change how we use devices with novel suggestions, recommendations and other ways to truly become bonus brains. Put simply, the makers of your phones and favorite tech gadgets claim AI agents will be supercharged versions of Siri and other voice assistants that can take inputs from personal apps, data and web searches to give truly nuanced answers. It's smarter AI that will supposedly fulfill a lot of the promises that current assistants can't, like anticipating needs and comprehending complex questions. Qualcomm,MediaTekand others have been openly including AI agents in their feature forecasting for the years ahead. Those chipmakers mentioned the technology when introducing their top-tier processors headed for next year's premiumAndroid phones. ""When we speak of agents and [generative] AI-driven agents for your personal devices, we're talking of software that can basically be contextualized to you and your needs, and then advise you within the context you operate personally -- your daily life, your calendar, your needs, whatever it is,"" said Lari Hämäläinen, senior partner and analyst for McKinsey & Company. AI agents have one mission, Hämäläinen said: ""How do we automate and bring convenience to people's lives?"" The trendy AI du jour, generative AI, debuted on premium smartphones at the end of last year with theGoogle Pixel 8 lineup, followed by this year'sSamsung Galaxy S24 seriesand finally,Apple Intelligencein the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16. In the years to come, generative AI features are expected to trickle down to cheaper devices, eventually being bundled into around 70% of phones by 2028, according toa recent IDC report. Analysts wouldn't even spitball a window for when AI agents could arrive. In the interim, Google'sGemini AI and its Project Astra(which recognizes objects through phone cameras or smart glasses) don't outright mention AI agents, but the capabilities they're building toward seem like they would bridge the gap between today's AI and the agents that define the next generation. The tech giant recently unveiled its next augmented reality concept headset made in partnership with Samsung, Project Moohan, which pairs AR and AI to guide wearers through the world commenting on what they're looking at. Google's continued experiments with AI software and hardware could bridge the gap to AI agents, getting users used to trusting artificial intelligence with queries and tasks. Still, AI agents are just ideas -- promises from companies eager to jump on the AI bandwagon. Skepticism is appropriate. People are starting to include AI tools likeChatGPTandMidjourneyinto their at-home workflows, but they have yet to integrate into the workforce at large, let alone into people's lives on the go. Here's how agentic AI on computers and smartphones could further change our day-to-day lives. As a forthcoming technology, AI agents don't have an explicit definition. But experts believe that AI this advanced will be able to go further than Siri or Google Assistant, which are limited to answering single questions at a time, when solving complex requests. They may even be able to negotiate with other AI agents on your behalf. Like with generative AI and 5G before it, this newest trend hasn't identified a ""killer app"" that would make it a must-have innovation. The first time I heard about AI agents was from MediaTek describing its newest Dimensity 9400 mobile silicon, which includes anAgentic AI Engine. This doesn't mean phones with the chip will get AI agents -- rather, it's a toolset to help device-makers and developers make their own AI agents and applications. Developers could harness the tech to supercharge in-app searches or use personal data to predict behavior and anticipate needs -- perhaps nudging users to take actions according to their usual schedule. This is one of the entry steps to get app makers to integrate or make their own AI agents as they manifest into being in the years to come. MediaTek's chipmaking rival Qualcomm wasn't far behind. At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui in October, the company introduced several ways thatAI agents would change your habits. They can search through your apps for relevant information, tailor advice based on your schedule and even offer suggestions before you make requests, Durga Malladi, Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of technology planning and edge solutions, said during the summit. ""We're just entering the era of more proactive computing with pervasive AI constantly running in the background and anticipating your next move, figuring out what you might be doing next and getting input solutions before you even ask for them,"" Malladi said. Ultimately, Qualcomm sees these AI agents as ways to supplant apps entirely. People will simply ask questions, and the agents will do all the work for them, providing clear answers to requests. ""[Apps are] still there, but they're in the background,"" Malladi told CNET Senior European Correspondent Katie Collins in October. Read more:Your Apps Are on Borrowed Time. AI Agents Are on the Way That tracks with what analysts expect in the coming years, but it does raise questions about how much an AI can know about you to take action on your behalf. Trusting AI agents to spend money or handle scheduling requires more than just access to credentials, says Avi Greengart, president and lead analyst atTechsponential; the agents need to have deep knowledge of your preferences to make decisions users agree with. Users need totrust their AI. ""This isn't just a technological problem but a personal and cultural one as well,"" Greengart said. At Snapdragon Summit in October, Qualcomm showed how its chips enable in-car experiences that can be customized for every passenger, including the kids. While generative AI has only recently spread through consumer gadgets, big tech companies have been investing in AI car tech for years. The holy grail of automotive AI remains self-driving technology, especially as self-driving robotaxis flood the streets of cities like San Francisco. But now some tech companies are thinking about how AI agents can integrate with cars, too. Qualcommdebuted a pair of auto-focused chipsat Snapdragon Summit and announced that Mercedes Benz andLi Autowould use the silicon in future models. The chipmaker laid out its ideas for how its silicon could help with functions of your life on wheels, using the neural processing unit to handle the flurry of sensors in tomorrow's cars -- not just the ones outside vehicles scanning the roads, but the ones inside that can track your movements. If you say, ""Roll down that window,"" and point, your car should follow along. But eventually, Qualcomm believes AI agents will make it into cars to augment those experiences, too. Car-based chips have more processing power, will be able to sync with and expand the capabilities of the driver's network of devices and could deliver more complex solutions. Qualcomm exec Malladi gave a hypothetical example: On a drive home, you might ask your agent to make a dinner reservation, which consults all your local preferences. ""[The agent] responds to you saying 'here's the reservation that I found, and by the way, you didn't ask for it, but I'm going to read it out to you because you're driving to that restaurant and sent an SMS to your wife saying just meet him there,'"" Malladi said at the Snapdragon Summit, emphasizing the difference from reactive AI to one that makes inferences and takes action. ""In this case, the agent is anticipating what your next question could be."" It would be wise to take claims that the car could be a center of AI agent functionality with caution, analyst Hämäläinen said. Putting aside the self-interest of Qualcomm and auto companies in hyping the AI auto experience, people just don't spend enough time in cars to warrant that centrality -- and it would be tough for companies to count on AI centrality for the many millions of people who don't have cars. ""What is very true is that the car is an extremely central and important device and an asset, and that will have a lot of AI compute in them. I do not think it will be that tied to the personal agent experiences,"" Hämäläinen said. He gave Apple as an example of a company that can count on its iPhones as the center of an AI experience. ""Most people are not tied like that into their cars. They're much more tied to their phones because the phone is always with them. The car is not,"" Hämäläinen said. While generative AI is slowly filtering into phones, its applications have been scattered across varying use cases like text generation, improved Siri and voice assistant responses, expanding images beyond their borders and other photo-editing capabilities. The expansive promises companies made and our ideas of how to use phone-basedgenerative AI in real-life situationshaven't come to pass yet. As CNET continues forecasting, we turn to what AI agents could be capable of: bigger and more exciting applications that help users complete more complex responsibilities. Juggling last-minute tasks, developing itineraries with personal preferences in mind and sending reminders to stay on schedule are some of the ways we thinkAI agents could help phone ownersin their day-to-day lives. But there's no consensus on when AI agents will enter the mainstream. There are some technical obstacles to realizing that technology, from improving mobile chips to refining large language models to produce coherent outputs. More important are the issues of scale needed to make AI agents work on everyone's phone, Hämäläinen noted. It's one thing for OpenAI to field a volume of ChatGPT requests every day, but it's another question to meet the AI demand from the hundreds of millions of phones that ship every year to users who are on them all the time. ""The [phone] usage is constant. When you're on your phone, you're on the phone like five hours a day, right? So it's very demanding,"" he said. ""Companies like OpenAI or Microsoft with CoPilot, they don't have to deal with that level of instant demand all the time."" At its Snapdragon Summit, Qualcomm was bullish that augmented reality would go hand in hand with the future of AI agents, especially coordinating what AR glasses see with user questions. Given how nascent that gadget niche is, with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses as the only mainstream model, it could be a while before those kinds of interfaces -- including gesture control, a la the Apple Vision Pro -- become widespread. Google's Project Astra is pushing this marriage of AI and visual interfaces forward, and though it's still in the testing stages, it could offer another software solution for glasses hardware to embrace. Consumers will probably sooner adapt to a different interface: shifting to relying more on voice controls, analysts predict. Alexa owners and folks with Google Assistant-directed smart homes are already getting used to this method of interacting with gadgets, which is handy when your hands are full or as an accessibility feature. But the better reason consumers will get used to it is because it's already on devices in their pockets and running through wireless earbuds as tech giants continue upgrading Siri and other voice assistants. Perhaps the road to AI agents lies in letting go of the tactile phone experience as people know it today. ""I think what we'll see is that the device experience will get a lot automated as well, and you can just prompt your phone based on a voice command,"" Hämäläinen said. ""I think you can expect a lot that you today handle by [tapping] your finger will get done automatically.""","Here's how next-generation ""agentic AI"" will change your smartphone life.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/move-over-siri-and-alexa-ai-agents-are-the-digital-assistants-weve-wanted/,
439,Best VPN Service for 2024: Our Top Pick in a Tight Race,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. Factors to consider in a VPN  Internet speed loss VPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less, which shouldn’t be noticeable even on slower connections. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%. Privacy VPNs bolster your privacy by encrypting your connection and masking your IP address. Look for features like kill switches and DNS leak protection as well as strict no-logging policies backed up by third-party audits and transparency reports. Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. Server network When considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. At the high end, the most comprehensive VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks. Additionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, like Tor (The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers that offer additional privacy. Device support Think about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on. Most VPN companies offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. You can typically install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps, like Xbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the router. Most VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. Most folks should be fine even with eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may feel constrained. Streaming capabilities VPNs can be great for privacy, but they're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock, Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad. On the flip side, VPNs unlock access to foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries. Cost  Privacy protection and transparency SCORE ExpressVPNis currently CNET’s pick for the best VPN overall, scoring an 8.8/10 on our VPN rating scale. It’s a veteran VPN provider that consistently demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy and transparency. It’s alsoexcellent for streamingand the easiest VPN app to use on any platform. For the best, you’ll need to pay a premium. ExpressVPN is one of the most expensive VPN providers currently on the market. The service costs $13 a month, $100 a year (renewing at $117 a year) or $140 total for two years of service (renewing at $150 per year), which is considerably more expensive than the $48 for your first year or $56 total for the first two years that Surfshark charges (after its introductory pricing, Surfshark renews at $60 per year for both the one- and two-year plans). NordVPN is more in line with ExpressVPN's price at $13 a month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years annually (the one- and two-year plans renew at $140 annually). Best VPN for Windows,Best VPN for iPhone Although fast enough for almost any online activity, ExpressVPN’s speeds aren't quiteas fast as some of its competitors, based on our latest speed tests. In 2024, we measured a 24.8% average speed loss with ExpressVPN. This is still fast, considering many VPNs can slash your internet speeds by 50% or more. We saw better speeds from NordVPN (11% speed loss) and Surfshark (17% speed loss). Still, ExpressVPN’s speeds were largely consistent and aligned with our expectations across protocols and server locations. Overall, we registered the fastest speeds through ExpressVPN’s proprietary Lightway protocol on MacOS (7% speed loss). On the other end of the spectrum, the slowest speeds we measured were through OpenVPN on Windows, at a 48% speed loss. Overall, speeds were generally faster with relatively close server locations like New York and the UK, and slower to distant locations like Australia and Singapore. Either way, ExpressVPN’s speeds were still fast enough for general browsing and data-intensive activities like streaming, gaming and videoconferencing, especially if you use Lightway. We did encounter DNS leaks on Windows while split tunneling was enabled, but Express immediately disabled the feature after confirming it. The company then published a blog post outlining the issue, and shortly rolled out a fix, after which we detected no leaks. The leaks were concerning, but the swift, decisive response from ExpressVPN was illustrative of the company’s commitment to transparency and user privacy. The company’s latest independent audit is slated to be published soon, building on its industry-leading audit count. ExpressVPN says it collects no logs, a claim bolstered by a 2023 no-logs audit by KPMG. Nettitide performed a penetration test of ExpressVPN's Windows app in April 2024, and Cure53 audited the company's browser extension in 2024. In July 2024, ExpressVPN published a detailed transparency report showing the number of DMCA requests, warrants from government institutions, and civil/government/law enforcement requests it received, but because Express doesn't log information (as audits confirmed), the company didn't have any information to share with authorities. In addition to its transparency efforts, ExpressVPN’s privacy protections are top-notch and forward-thinking. The provider recently upgraded its proprietary open-source Lightway VPN protocol with Quantum Protection to help guard against future threats from quantum computers, along with encryption enhancements to better protect against threats like eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. ExpressVPN’s TrustedServer technology elevates the protections of the traditional RAM-only server architecture by reinstalling the entire software stack with every reboot. In addition to offering excellent privacy protections, ExpressVPN delivers the most consistent and streamlined VPN app experiences across platforms. Its minimalist interface is simple to use, whether you’re an advanced VPN user or if you’ve never used one before. The app settings are easy to navigate and finding a server location is straightforward. We like how the app always connects in a snap, which isn’t always the case with other VPNs -- like Surfshark -- which often struggle to connect immediately on the first attempt. Alongside its VPN offering, ExpressVPN's plans all include a password manager, ad blocker and tracker locker, with the one- and two-year plansbundling ID alertsand ID theft insurance. The two-year package throws in data removal services. If you want the best for streaming, ExpressVPN is a good bet because it effortlessly unblocks all sorts of streaming content, includingNetflix, Disney Plus, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. In our August testing, it also improved its streaming capabilities on Apple TV, where it previously struggled with Netflix. The provider also offers eight simultaneous connections, which is slightly less generous than Proton VPN or NordVPN’s 10 simultaneous connections but considerably less than the unlimited simultaneous connections allowed by others like Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish. If you’re not satisfied with the service, you can request your money back within 30 days of your purchase. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfshark(8.6/10) boasts an impressive suite of privacy and security features, unlimited simultaneous connections, an easy-to-use interface and an expansive global network of more than 3,200 servers in 100 countries. For annual or two-year plans, it's still significantly cheaper than most of its competitors, making Surfshark one of the best-value VPNs on the market -- although we’re disappointed by the high cost for monthly plans ($15 per month). The yearly plan starts at $48 for the first year and then jumps to $60 for any additional years of service. If you opt for the two-year plan, you'll pay $56 upfront for the initial two years combined, then $60 per year for any additional years. Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video,Best VPN for Multiple Devices Surfshark's impressive 17% average internet speed loss that we clocked in our late 2023 benchmarking is right up there with the fastest VPNs on the market, right behind NordVPN’s 11% speed loss and Mullvad’s 13.5%. As long as your base internet connection is speedy, Surfshark’s speeds are fast enough for even the most data-heavy online activities like streaming or gaming. Surfshark’s speeds were the fastest when we used the WireGuard, where we registered a mere 9% speed loss on Mac and 13% speed loss on Windows during our tests. As expected, OpenVPN speeds were slightly slower on both MacOS (19% speed loss) and Windows (28% speed loss). Along with standard VPN features such as akill switch and DNS leak protection, some of the more notable Surfshark features include camouflage mode (which hides the fact that you're using a VPN), split-tunneling, NoBorders mode (which lets you use Surfshark in regions where VPNs are restricted) and multihop VPN connections. You'll also get access to Surfshark's CleanWeb technology, which blocks ads and malware and helps you avoid phishing attacks. One innovation we especially like is Surfshark's Nexus network, which connects the VPN's entire network of servers together and allows you to choose multiple servers to route your connection through. The functionality is somewhat similar to Tor, but Surfshark says it's faster. With its Dynamic MultiHop, IP Randomizer and IP Rotator functions, the Nexus network can give you a few extra layers of protection while you use the VPN -- which can be particularly beneficial to users withcritical privacy needs. We also appreciate Surfshark's Linux graphical user interface app, making Surfshark one of the best Linux VPNs -- for both beginners and seasoned users alike. Surfshark says it doesn't log any user activity. Although no-logging claims are virtually impossible to prove with 100% certainty, Surfshark passed a no-logs audit by Deloitte in 2022. Additionally, its Android app passed an independent Mobile App Security Assessment in 2023. In August, the company also released its first transparency report, stating that the company disclosed no user-related data in response to the more than 350,000 DMCA requests and 45 government inquiries from April through June. In our tests, Surfshark had no problems unblocking Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video content. Additionally, Surfshark features apps for Android TV, Apple TV and the Amazon Fire TV Stick, which makes it a great VPN for streaming. Surfshark delivers a smooth interface across all platforms, including a full Linux GUI, but we would have liked to see the apps establish a connection more quickly during our tests. With Surfshark, you’ll have access to a vast global network of servers spanning 100 different countries, which helps ensure fast, stable connections wherever you may be living or traveling. If you're not satisfied with the service for any reason, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPN(8.6/10) offers excellent service thanks to its best-in-class connection speeds, privacy-focused features and consistent geo-unblocking for streaming services. At $13 monthly, $60 annually or $83 total for your first two years, NordVPN sets you back less initially than premium VPN rivals like ExpressVPN but more than budget-oriented companies like Surfshark and PIA. Subsequent price hikes drive the price to $140 a year. Luckily, subscriptions do stack, so you can buy a discounted plan during a Black Friday sale even if you've still got several months or a year left to avoid a pricey autorenewal. Best VPN for Streaming,Best VPN for Smart TV In our 2024 speed tests, NordVPN solidified itself as thefastest VPN, edging out both Surfshark and ExpressVPN with an average speed loss of just 11.1%. Using its NordLynx VPN protocol, we measured an average internet speed loss of just 3.2% with Windows and 12.6% on MacOS. On OpenVPN, the average internet download speed loss was a blazing-fast 10.1% with MacOS and a respectable 18.8% with Windows. With apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS, browsers and even Apple TV, Nord runs on almost any platform you can think of. Like most VPNs, NordVPN doesn’t quite match ExpressVPN’s commitment to privacy, but it’s still a great option for anyone wanting a reliable VPN with a large suite of features. Its combination of user-friendly design that doesn't compromise on settings makes it an outstanding choice for casual VPN newcomers and seasoned power users alike. We appreciate NordVPN's commitment to privacy and security. In addition to features like Onion over VPN (Tor) and a Double VPN, which deliver additional encryption, a 2023 audit by Deloitte backed up its no-log claims for improved transparency. Folks with serious privacy needs can even buy a Nord subscription withcryptocurrenciesfor pseudo-anonymity. Zero-logging policies are challenging to verify with absolute certainty, but third-party audits provide peace of mind. On the entertainment side, we had no issues streaming US and UK Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus libraries on most devices. NordVPN’s global server network comprises more than 6,800-plus servers spanning 113 countries. That international reach is greater than competitors like Surfshark and ExpressVPN, although all three VPN companies feature at least 100 countries. Whereas other VPN providers, including ExpressVPN and PIA, allow file sharing across their entire server fleet, Nord limits you to select peer-to-peer servers. Its blisteringly fast internet speed throughput and large server network make Nord a terrific choice for competitive gamers or entertainment enthusiasts needing the fastest possible speeds. Additionally, its robust suite of advanced tools, including a Double VPN and Tor Over VPN make Nord a great option for users with critical privacy needs, like political activists or investigative journalists. While some of Nord’s amenities such asMeshnetare admittedly overkill for the average person simply seeking additional privacy when browsing the web or a VPN for streaming, they’re nice-to-haves nonetheless. Overall, NordVPN sports advanced privacy features in an intuitive service. The only free plan we recommend SCORE Proton VPN(8.4/10) has a truly impressive free tier, and it's really the onlyfree VPNwe've encountered that's worth using. It lacks support for torrenting and doesn't include all the bells and whistles as the paid tiers, but Proton VPN's free tier is secure and doesn't put limits on speed, data or usage time like most other free VPNs do. Free users get access to servers in five countries (Japan, the Netherlands, the US, Poland and Romania) and can connect one device at a time. Proton VPN's paid plans cost $10 monthly, $60 a year or $108 for two years (both the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually). Best Free VPN,Best VPN for Netflix Proton’s speeds were more than adequate for bandwidth-intensive tasks like 4K video streaming, video conferencing and gaming. In our 2024 testing, we clocked an average of 21% internet speed loss. That’s faster than ExpressVPN (25% average download speed loss), and comfortably below the 25% speed loss we recommend. Proton is slightly slower than Surfshark (17%), Mullvad (13.5%) and NordVPN (11%), but it’s certainly no slouch. Proton VPN hasn't been around nearly as long as peers such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN. In a few short years, it has earned a sturdy reputation for security and transparency. Much of that reputation was built on the back of Proton Mail's already established strength as a secure email solution, but Proton VPN has become a solid product on its own merit since it launched in 2017. In July of 2024, Proton VPN underwent a successful no-logs audit by Securitum. All of its apps across platforms are fully open-source, making Proton VPN the only provider in our top five to have its software'ssource codepublicly available for anyone to scrutinize. The apps are also routinely audited by third-party cybersecurity professionals who confirmed that ""no important security issues were identified"" during their latest audit. Proton VPN has all the standard security features you'd expect from any VPN provider worth its salt, including akill switch, DNS leak protection and AES 256-bit encryption on the OpenVPNprotocolor ChaCha20 with WireGuard. The provider also offers additional security protections like an ad/malware blocker, Tor over VPN and a Stealth protocol to help cloak your VPN connection and bypass firewalls. The pièce de résistance of Proton VPN's security suite is its fleet of Secure Core servers. Essentially, these servers operate in the same way as other VPN providers' multi-hop functionality does, but Proton's Secure Core servers are wholly owned by the company, equipped with hard disk encryption and housed in secure data centers in a defunct military base in Iceland and underground bunkers in Switzerland and Sweden. Route your traffic through Proton's Secure Core servers first to add a robust layer of physical and technical protection before exiting through another VPN server in a different country. Proton VPN is a solid choice for VPN power users and anyone with critical security needs, but it's also excellent for casual VPN users who are simply looking to give their online privacy a boost or access geographically restricted content. It's fast, easy to use across all platforms and can unblock streaming services likeNetflix, Disney Plus, Max (formerly HBO Max) and Amazon Prime Video. Support for Android TV, Fire TV and Apple TV streaming devices makes watching foreign Netflix or Disney Plus libraries a breeze. A Linux graphical user interface app makes Proton a worthy choice for a Linux VPN. There's also an ARM for Windows app, so you can use Proton on Snapdragon PCs. Paid plans include access to more than 9,300 servers in 112 countries with support for 10 simultaneous connections and also include a 30-day, money-back guarantee. Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE Private Internet Access(7.6/10) is one of thebest cheap VPNson the market. Its wallet-friendly pricing sets you back just $12 monthly, $40 annually or $79 for three years. By comparison, most VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically charge $60-plus per year. The value-packed Surfshark charges $45 for your first year, its price jumps to $60 after its initial sweet introductory pricing, whereas PIA foregoes price hikes for attractively transparent pricing. Best VPN for Mac,Best VPN for Apple TV Unfortunately, PIA delivered middling internet speeds in our testing with an average speed loss of 49%. All VPNs slow down your connection somewhat, with thefastest VPNsoffering an average internet speed loss of 20% or less. For instance, NordVPN — the quickest VPN we benchmarked — provided a best-in-class 11% reduction, while Surfshark clocked a solid 17%. Folks with faster internet connections like fiber shouldn't notice a difference even with a higher speed loss, but PIA isn’t ideal for people with slower speeds like satellite internet users. Even a 50% speed loss with a 50Mbps connection is still enough for some bandwidth-intensive activities like 4K video streaming (Netflix recommendsa minimum of 15Mbps). Despite its relatively low cost, PIA doesn't cut corners. Although it's not the most feature-rich VPN, you'll get a solid privacy suite, including akill switchthat stops your internet if your VPN gets disconnected, 256-bit encryption andsplit tunnelingfor using a VPN for some apps but not others. There's multi-hop, which routes your connection through another server for additional privacy and obfuscated servers, making it tougher for apps or ISPs to identify when you're using a VPN. PIA also boasts unlimited simultaneous connections, and the pricier ExpressVPN limits you to eight. Its extensive network of 35,000 servers spread throughout 91 countries makes Private Internet Access great for travel. PIA offers nearly as many individual country locations as rivals like NordVPN (111), ExpressVPN (105), Surfshark (100) and Proton VPN (112), while trouncing IPVanish (56). We found that PIA unblocked Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on both US and UK servers, making it a good VPN for streaming. With its decent features, pricing transparency and subscriptions that significantly undercut the competition, PIA remains a solid VPN that’s gentle on the pocketbook. Its relative affordability compared to VPN rivals makes PIA’s speed issues easy to overlook. Open-source VPN for privacy-focused users SCORE Mullvadis an independently owned and open-source VPN provider focused on building trust through transparency with its commitment to protecting the privacy and security of its users. Although some other VPNs are considerably more well-known in the industry, Mullvad's offering is just as polished and easy to use as what's offered by many of the market's bigger players. Mullvad's straightforward approach to pricing is a breath of fresh air, especially with so many other VPN providers concocting ever-more convoluted pricing structures. Mullvad costs about $5 a month, whether you want to use it for a month, a year or a decade, and you're never locked into a long-term subscription plan. If you're not satisfied with the service, you can get a refund within 30 days of purchase. Fastest VPN,Best Cheap VPN With 684 servers across 44 countries, Mullvad's VPN server network is comparatively small. Even so, the network covers the most in-demand locations and is pretty well spread out across the globe. What its network may lack in size, it makes up for in speed. In our latest round of speed testing, we measured just a 13.5% drop in average internet speeds (VPNs will slow you down50% or more), easily making it one of the fastest VPNs we've tested. Mullvad's primary focus is on user privacy. Like most other top VPN providers, Mullvad employs industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption, using the OpenVPN protocol or ChaCha20 on WireGuard, to secure users' connections. Mullvad's kill switch feature and DNS leak protection are enabled by default and can't be disabled. Duringour testing, the kill switch worked as expected and we detected no leaks of any kind. The company says it doesn't keep any logs of its users' activity, and for the most part, it's pretty transparent about how it operates and what it does to protect user privacy. Mullvad is unique in that it doesn't require any personal information at sign-up. Most VPN providers ask users to provide an email address and enter a username, Mullvad generates a random 16-digit account number to activate each new user account. You don't even need to provide any payment information since Mullvad accepts cash sent via mail. Mullvad'ssource codebeing entirely open source is a testament to the company's transparency, but we'd still like to see Mullvad issue an annual transparency report to give the public a view of how many legal requests the company gets and where they're coming from. You don't just have to take Mullvad's word for it: Radically Open Security backed up Mullvad's no-logs assertions in a 2023 independent audit. We also were impressed with Mullvad's forward-looking privacy initiatives, which include a quantum-resistant tunnel (that protects against future threats from quantum computers) and its protections against AI-driven traffic analysis (which makes it virtually impossible to analyze traffic patterns that can identify the websites you’re visiting by sending uniform packet sizes mixed with garbage data). During our testing, we liked Mullvad's simple, straightforward interface. Some VPN apps can be tricky to navigate (especially for VPN newcomers), Mullvad's apps are neatly laid out and settings are simple to enable or disable. We were able to easily locate Mullvad's server locations and the apps always connected in a snap, which was nice because not all VPN apps establish connections as smoothly as Mullvad does. Although Mullvad is super easy to use, it's not the best for streaming geographically restricted content. We were able toaccess Netflixand Disney Plus without any issues but were denied access to stream Amazon Prime Video when connected to Mullvad's servers, since it recognized that we were using a VPN.  In a tight, three-way race for CNET’s Editors'Choice Awardfor best overall VPN,ExpressVPNcame out on top. ExpressVPN gained an edge over worthy rivals SurfShark and NordVPN thanks to the service's privacy and usability, making it the best of the best with an 8.8/10 rating. Privacy is one of the main reasons people turn to VPN services, and ExpressVPN meets that requirement with unmatched transparency, including its privacy policy and Trusted Server technology. Trusted Server technology goes a step beyond traditional RAM-only server infrastructure, resulting in maximum peace of mind when it comes to your browsing data. ExpressVPN is also consistently fast, with speeds boosted by its Lightway protocol, which also delivers future-proof post-quantum protection, cleanly blending performance and security. Using ExpressVPN's service is a breeze, reliably unblocking streaming content and offering useful security features with its Advanced Protection suite. ExpressVPN evensupports Microsoft Copilot Plus PCs, meaning it has apps for nearly every platform you can think of. Whether you're a seasoned VPN aficionado or have never used a virtual private network app before, ExpressVPN is intuitive and accessible. It's also our go-to recommendation forstreaming out-of-market NFL games. Surfsharkis a great choice for folks seeking practical privacy features on a budget. It offers connection speeds and features comparable to ExpressVPN and NordVPN but at an annual rate that's considerably cheaper ($48 for the first year or $56 total for the first two years, then $60 a year after the promotional period for both the one- and two-year plans, which is still cheaper than the discounted price of many other VPNs, like ExpressVPN or NordVPN). Surfshark also offers support for unlimited simultaneous devices, which makes it a great option for people with large families or just a lot of connected devices. There's even an Apple TV app for easy streaming in the living room and a Linux GUI app for simplicity on Linux. Surfshark doesn't quite match ExpressVPN's commitment to privacy, which makes it less suited for people with critical privacy needs. NordVPNis an excellent feature-packed VPN. NordVPN's connection speeds were the very fastest we tested, with CNET Labs clocking a best-in-class 11.1% average internet download speed loss. It offers a slew of advanced privacy benefits, including a double VPN as well as Onion Over VPN for extra encryption, and Meshnet for secure file sharing, alongside more standard features like split tunneling to let you decide which online activities need VPN protection. Most people won't need all of those options, but they're nice inclusions for power users. Nord has even begun rolling out post-quantum protection for its apps (starting with its Linux app), for beefed up security against threats from quantum computing, like breaking encryption. Nord supports nearly any platform imaginable, including niche devices like the Apple TV and ARM-based Windows PCs. Overall, NordVPN offers a high-performing service with excellent features for people who want advanced privacy protection and superb streaming capabilities. Each VPN service we recommend has excellent value for a specific use case, and we point out the ideal user for each one. The array of options available means there's a VPN service suited to your needs, whether your privacy needs arecasual or critical. Also, consider jumping on one ofthe best VPN deals currently available, which many of our top picks are offering. When shopping for a virtual private network, you'll need to figure out the best VPN for your needs and budget. Here's what to look for. VPNssomewhat lower your internet speedbecause you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server before communicating with apps, websites and other internet services rather than a direct connection. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less. Generally, even folks with slower connections — like satellite internet — won't notice a marginal 25% or under dip. For bandwidth-intensive applications like gaming, 4K video streaming or uploading large files, you'll want a VPN with minimal speed loss. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%. In our 2024 testing, NordVPN came out on top with an impressively low 11% average internet speed loss. Mullvad, Surfshark, Proton VPN and ExpressVPN all clocked an average internet download speed loss of 25% or less. This table shows the speeds we experienced in our testing. Your speeds will vary depending on factors like your internet service plan and connection type. The percentage of speed lost is intended as a general indicator of how much the VPN slows down your connection; lower numbers represent a faster overall connection. VPNs bolster your privacy by masking your public IP address, which — like your physical address — indicates identifying information about your geographical location. But the best VPNs provide robust privacy protections. At a minimum, we recommend a VPN with 256-bit encryption (for OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPNprotocols) or ChaCha20 (with WireGuard), a strict no-logging policy and DNS leak protection. Because logging is tough to verify, look for regular third-party audits.You can and should be skepticalof your VPN provider's zero-log claims. Still,VPN audits are importantbut don't provide the full privacy picture. Additionally, transparency reports offer peace of mind. We also suggest sticking with a VPN that includes a kill switch. More privacy-concerned users like investigative journalists or political activists will appreciate advanced features such asobfuscation(which makes it harder for ISPs to determine that you're using a VPN),Tor over VPN(for additional encryption using the Tor network) and a double VPN (which relies on a second VPN server connection to enhance encryption). Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. Whether you're just curious or you suspect your VPN isn't working, you may want to perform aVPN test. When considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. For instance, one virtual private network company may have twice the total number of servers as a competitor but half the different country locations, meaning you've got fewer international choices. At the high end, the best VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks. Outside of country locations, some VPNs allow file sharing across all servers, whereas others feature dedicated P2P (peer-to-peer) options. For purposes like torrenting, check whether your desired provider permits file sharing on all servers or select ones. Additionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, likeTor(The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers. Onion over VPN and Double VPN servers provide extra privacy by bolstering your encryption even further when compared with a standard VPN connection, with Tor using the Onion network while a double VPN relies on a second VPN tunnel. On the other hand,obfuscated serversmake it more difficult for apps, websites or internet service providers to determine that you're using a VPN. Think about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on. Most VPN companies offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. Apple TV apps are increasingly common, with ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA, NordVPN, PrivadoVPN and IPVanish featuring TVOS applications. A graphical user interface application may be easier forLinuxusers than a command line interface option. Surfshark, Proton and PIA boast Linux GUI apps, making them compelling choices for Linux VPNs. Windows for ARM support is available with some VPNs, including NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and PIA. You can typically install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps, likeXbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the router. Most VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. ExpressVPN allows eight, while NordVPN and Proton give you 10. Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish are unlimited. Even with a provider like Express, Proton or Nord, you can still install a VPN on as many devices as you wish, but you'll be able to have only a handful of active sessions at once. Most folks should be fine even with eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may feel constrained. If you've got a lot of gadgets you want to install a VPN on, you may want to consider one of thebest VPNs for multiple devices, including Surfshark, NordVPN, PIA and ExpressVPN. Wondering which VPN services work on which devices? We've got you covered. VPNs can be great for privacy, they're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock (for streaming NFL games), Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad. On the flip side, VPNs unlock access to foreignNetflix(so you can watch Hot Frosty), Disney Plus (so you can stream Moana all you like) andAmazon Prime Video(where you can currently find Lisa Frankenstein) libraries. You may even be able tosave money by using a VPN for streaming. For more info, check out thebest VPNs for Amazon Prime Videoand thebest VPNs for streaming. With most VPNs, you can sign up for a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year VPN subscription. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a data breach or stop allowing access to foreignNetflix librariesover a year. On the high end, VPNs such as Express cost around $100 per year, with value-packed providers like Surfshark and PIA offering year-long prices from $40 to $60. Some companies include price hikes: NordVPN normally charges $60 annually for your first year, then your plan renews at $140 per 12 months. Similarly, Surfshark goes for $48 a year upfront, then renews at $60 annually. Make a budget, then find a VPN provider that fits the bill while being mindful of price hikes. Notably, you can renew while avoiding raised renewal rates by taking advantage of seasonal discounts like Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. If you're on a budget, you may want to consider one of thebest cheap VPNs, like Surfshark, PIA or Mullvad. Don't use free VPN providers: Except for Proton -- the best free VPN on the market — you'll find only paid VPN options on this list because they're the only ones we recommend. Look for a no-logs VPN but understand the caveats: The best VPNs keep as few logs as possible and make them as anonymous as possible, so there's little data to provide should authorities come knocking. Even ""no-logs"" VPNs aren't 100% anonymous. There are limits to the privacy VPNs currently provide to iOS users: Recent independentresearch has surfacedsuggesting iPhones and iPads running iOS 14 or later may be vulnerable to device-only VPN leaks, regardless of which VPN is used. Apple users concerned with potential leaks can take extra precautions by installing their VPN on a home router to ensure their entire Wi-Fi network is encrypted. Some iOS users may potentially reduce the likelihood of leaks while outside of a home network by enabling their VPN's kill switch and selecting OpenVPN protocols. You can also try closing all apps, activating your VPN and then enabling and disabling Airplane Mode before using your device normally. Apple advises users to activate their device'sAlways On VPNprofile for additional protection. VPN transparency is important, but warrant canaries are only the beginning: Many services use ""warrant canaries"" to passively note to the public whether or not they've been subpoenaed by a government entity. This is because many investigations from national security agencies can't be actively disclosed by law. Like the no-logging issue, warrant canaries aren't always as straightforward as they seem. You should spend more time investigating whether your prospective VPN has cooperated with authorities in the past, and how and when it's disclosed that fact. Think twice about using a US-based VPN: The Patriot Act is still the law of the land in the US, and that means US-based VPNs have little recourse if and when the feds show up with subpoenas ornational security lettersin hand demanding access to servers, VPN user accounts or other data. Yes, they may have little data to access if the service has a strong no-logs policy, but why not just choose a service that's based outside Uncle Sam's jurisdiction? (If this is a concern for you, you'll also want to avoid countries with which the US has intelligence-sharing agreements.) Although VPN speeds aren't the only important criteria, you'll need a virtual private network provider with fast speeds. If all servers severely hinder your internet speeds, then streaming, browsing the web or hopping on Zoom calls may be be frustrating. Here's how VPN provider speeds stacked up. A virtual private network is an online service available as a mobile app, desktop app, browser extension or other software that encrypts your internet traffic to boost your privacy online. A VPN also prevents your internet service provider from tracking the websites or apps you're using and stops most of those websites and apps from seeing your actual geographic location, allowing you to bypass content blocks in some countries to access critical news and educational information. You may be able touse a VPN to circumvent throttling restrictionsfrom wireless carriers or ISPs. Additionally, VPNs are great for unblocking geo-protected content like accessingforeign Netflix librariesor watching out-of-market NFL games. We strongly recommend using a good VPN for everyday use as well as for work, particularly if your work involves handling sensitive information. The best VPNs deliver a strong level of privacy protection without compromising on performance, particularly internet speeds. At CNET, we rigorously test each VPN across major platforms to find the ones that provide exceptional privacy, reliability, speed and value. This list is constantly being updated as we actively test VPNs and look at the latest research, so expect this guide to change throughout the year as we put each VPN through its paces. We've recently retestedSurfshark,ExpressVPN,NordVPN,Private Internet Access,Proton,IPVanish,CyberGhost,MullvadandPrivadoVPNfrom the ground up.  Our hands-on testing and review process is designed to cut through that hype and determine the best VPNs of the bunch. When we look at each VPN service, we're not just examining them for their technical weaknesses, but we're also scrutinizing their individual performance strengths. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN across over 20 factors, and we continuallyimprove our methodologyas we learn more. Our rigorous testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests across multiple worldwide servers to determine accurate internet speed loss averages. We test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries, as well as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks. By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting or sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and itsownership in a notoriously murky market. The VPNs on this list earn our recommendation for more than just boosting their digital privacy strengths -- they enable easy streaming to overcome geo-blocked media, have torrenting-friendly servers and are fast enough to support gaming globally. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the uses we recommend it for most. Because we strive to keep on top of a fast-changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we learn more and retest. Picking the best VPN requires knowing two basic things to start with: What you want to use it for, and what you're willing to pay. The range of VPN offerings is vast, but those two things will help you find a VPN that has the right blend of speed, security and cost. Below, you'll find specific FAQ sections on picking a VPN based on the most common needs: gaming, streaming media, working from home andprivacy-criticalprofessions. In general, you'll want a VPN that provides sufficient encryption, doesn't log your activity, offers essential security features like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, has server locations where you need them and can give you fast connection speeds. Our top five VPNs have all these features, although connection speeds will vary based on your internet provider and the server you connect to. For a deeper dive, check our detailed walk-through ofhow we evaluate and review VPNs. If you're looking for some quick pointers, here are universally applicable advice guides for beginners: Not every VPN can be a favorite. These are the ones we reviewed, but they're not full-throated recommendations for one reason or another, including limited features and concerns over adequately hiding your identity, ultimately falling short to other picks we selected as the best VPNs. IPVanishis a decent beginner-friendly VPN for folks seeking basic privacy. It does a good job of unblocking geographically protected streaming content on multiple services, such as providing access to foreign Netflix libraries (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). We liked its intuitive VPN apps which, while easy to use even for novices, weren't quite as streamlined as apps from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While you get privacy fundamentals from IPVanish, its US jurisdiction makes it unsuitable for people with critical privacy needs, like political activists, investigative journalists or asylum-seekers. Its comparatively slow speeds -- we measured a 44% average internet speed loss -- severely lagged behind NordVPN (11%), Surfshark (17%), Proton VPN (21%) and ExpressVPN (25%). Likewise, its relatively small server network of 56 countries is head and shoulders below Nord (113 countries), ExpressVPN (105) countries, Surfshark (100 countries), Proton (112 countries) and PIA (91 countries). IPVanish sets you back $13 per month, $40 for your first year or $52 for two years combined -- but the one- and two-year plans jump to $90 annually after your introductory pricing period. For the price, you can get a VPN with faster internet speed maintenance and a much larger web of servers. Read our IPVanish review. Hotspot Shield VPN's TLS-based Hydra Catapult protocol, US jurisdiction and large percentage of virtual servers might strip away our trust in its ability to provide more privacy protections than its competitors. Those are all key components to its ability to achieve the blazing speeds it delivered during its most recent speed tests. It effortlessly delivers smooth-streaming media and can dance between server connections without missing a beat, no matter how many interruptions you throw at it. A 26% speed loss puts it in second place, falling behind Surfshark (which lost just 16.9% of its speed the last time I tested it) and knocking Express down to third place with a 51.8% speed loss at the last measurement. Speed losses on UK connections were under 8%. When it comes to gaming, torrenting, browsing and streaming, these speed-dependent services won't be slowed down for Hotspot Shield users. We're not excited about Hotspot's privacy and security. Since the services use a closed-source proprietaryCatapult Hydra protocol, instead of the more transparent open-source OpenVPN protocol, we'd like to see Hotspot give the public morethird-party audits, which is a necessary step to bring Hotspot up to speed with routinely audited VPNs like TunnelBear. As recently as April 2021, review site VPNMentor discovered aDNS leakin Hotspot Shield's plug-in for Google Chrome. Hotspot acknowledged the issue at the time and aimed to improve the product. We're also not thrilled about the amount of user data Hotspot collects and its privacy policy. With its premium product, it gathers and retains much more information about users than most other VPNs. If you're using the free version of its product, it shares that information — along with even more finite data, including your MAC address and specific phone identifier — with advertising companies. Its interface is user-friendly and its speeds are thrilling, but spending time with Hotspot is going to leave your wallet a little lighter than you might prefer. Its current price is higher than its nearest competitors, its speeds slightly slower and its privacy more questionable. If you're looking for a VPN purely on the grounds of speed, we still recommend passing on Hotspot until it improves. Read our Hotspot Shield VPN review. TunnelBear has gotten a lot of hype in the last couple of years. When we looked under its hood and compared it with its VPN competitors, our excitement waned. TunnelBear's speeds are reasonable. We lost nearly 63% of internet speed overall when we used it, which is about average for a VPN. TunnelBear's speeds have steadily improved over the years as measured by other review and testing sites, and the US scores we recorded saw a speed loss of only 54%. On the plus side, TunnelBear is holding its own in the transparency competition among VPNs by publishing the results of its independent security audits andannual transparency reports. No IP address, DNS or other potentially user-identifying data leaks were detected during our testing, but in the past TunnelBear was observed to have been leaking WebRTC information. TunnelBear's VPN encryption is standard AES-256 and it supportsPerfect Forward Secrecy. It's also a Canadian business owned by US-based McAfee, so if you're looking for subpoena-proof international online privacy, you're playing with fire. It holds a paltry 23 server locations from which you can't manually choose your VPN server or even a city. It doesn't offer Tor-over-VPN, it offers split tunneling only on Android and it can't even unblock Netflix. On a per-month breakdown, the least expensive TunnelBear plan is its $120, three-year plan. You can also go month to month for $10 or pay $40 upfront for a single year. Either way, TunnelBear accepts payment via credit card and Bitcoin. Unlike other VPNs, it doesn't take PayPal, plus it doesn't supportAmazon Fire Stickor Android TV. Read our TunnelBear VPN review. If you need a VPN with a massive number of servers in tons of different locations, or if you’re a streaming enthusiast who likes to stream a wide variety of streaming content, then CyberGhost is a serviceable choice for casual use cases. If you’re a journalist, activist, dissident, physician, attorney or anyone else with critical privacy needs looking for a solid privacy-focused VPN, you won’t find it in CyberGhost. We like that CyberGhost publishes extremely detailed quarterly transparency reports (far outdoing all other VPNs in terms of detail and frequency) and operates a RAM-only server infrastructure, but the company’s overall approach to user privacy needs some major attention. CyberGhost’s privacy policy outlines some questionable data-sharing practices, and we were perplexed by how the VPN’s website and onboarding process reinforces the dangerous falsehood that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online. We were also disappointed to see how CyberGhost attempts to trick users into agreeing to share additional data with the company through its apps. Besides CyberGhost’s dubious approach to user privacy, the VPN’s apps are a mess. Throughout our testing process, we ran into numerous bugs and choppy performance on nearly all of CyberGhost’s apps across the platforms we tested. In our testing, all of CyberGhost’s apps consistently took an abnormally long time to connect to a server. At times, the apps would become entirely unresponsive, requiring an app restart and sometimes even a full system restart. CyberGhost’s apps also don’t offer much in the way of helpful bonus features like many others, including Surfshark and NordVPN, do. If you need a fast VPN, you’ll probably be disappointed by CyberGhost’s mediocre speed performance (30% speed lost in CNET’s testing). Overall, CyberGhost is a sub-par VPN provider with buggy apps, middling speed performance and questionable privacy practices. It costs $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 for the first 24 months (then $57 annually). For a similar price or even cheaper, you can choose several VPNs that are far superior to CyberGhost. Read our CyberGhost VPN review. Norton LifeLock, long known for excellence in security products, has a relatively limited offering in its VPN product.Norton Secure VPNdoes not support P2P or BitTorrent, Linux, routers or set-top boxes. It's Netflix and streaming compatibility is somewhat limited. Even worse, during testing, we experienced privacy-compromising data leaks. During CNET's testing, Norton Secure VPN speeds were comparable to other mid-tier VPNs but not particularly competitive. Although its VPN is only available on four platforms — Mac, iOS, Windows and Android — Norton gets points for its 24/7 live customer service phone support and 60-day money-back guarantee. Norton Secure VPN costs $40 for the first year, rising to $80 upon renewal. For that price, you get protection for five devices, which is well below ExpressVPN's eight simultaneous devices, Nord and Proton's 10 or Surshark and PIA's unlimited. Most VPN providers let you install a VPN on as many devices as you like but limit your simultaneous usage, Norton restricts how many total devices you can download a VPN on. This stingy device allowance is well under the competition. If you need more, you can always upgrade to Norton's Ultra VPN Plus with its 10-device policy. Norton Secure VPN Plus and Ultra VPN Plus bundle antivirus software, so if you need aVPN with antivirus, it's a consideration. Read our Norton Secure VPN review. PrivadoVPN is a decent no-frills VPN provider. Its free plan limits your monthly usage to 10GB, but you can pick from servers in 13 cities. You won't get the fastest internet download and upload speeds or the largest server network with its paid tiers, but Privado is a solid VPN for streaming. Privado has privacy-friendly Swiss jurisdiction, but it hasn't been audited. All of its privacy features work, including split tunneling, DNS leak protection and a kill switch, although its kill switch was almost too aggressive, keeping your internet cut off even after manually disconnecting from a server or closing the PrivadoVPN app. Because of its lack of audits, it's hard to recommend Privado for privacy-conscious users, like investigative journalists, political activists, asylum-seekers or even worried torrenters. Privado is one of the best VPNs for casual users, with a premium plan available as a convenient upgrade path. Read our PrivadoVPN review. In today's hyper-connected world, online privacy and security are increasingly critical. From online banking to communicating remotely with colleagues, we're transferring more data on our computers and smartphones than ever before. Much of that data is confidential information that we need to keep safe from hackers and snoops, so VPN use is on the rise as people take steps to secure their digital lives. Anyone who accesses the internet from a computer, tablet or smartphone can benefit from using a VPN. You don't have to be an activist, government dissident or journalist to need a VPN; the rise of third-party data brokers, cross-site advertising trackers, IP address collection and mobile geo-targeting have all combined to create an online browsing environment that poses significant threats to everyday users' basic privacy. Because a VPN encrypts your connection, your browsing data is protected from your internet service provider (and any government entities who request your ISP data), and your network administrator in most cases. A VPN can also shield your private information — like passwords, usernames and bank or shopping details — from anyone snooping on your network. Proton VPN'sfree tier is the only free VPN we've come across so far that's worth using. It costs a lot of money to operate a VPN, and free VPN services usually make up for the lack of subscription revenue by selling user data. In addition to being limited in usability and light on security, many free VPNs are fronts for malware distribution, which is why it's generally best to avoid them. Proton VPN's unlimited free tier is fast and secure and can be used for most online activities, including streaming Netflix. PrivadoVPN also offers a free plan that's great for casual users. But its uneven internet speeds, modest server network and lack of third-party audits holds is back from a recommendation as one of the best VPNs. If you're on a budget and want access to a premium VPN solution, you can also take a look at our picks for thebest cheap VPNs. Amobile VPNis simply a VPN you can use on your mobile device like your iPhone or Android phone. All of the providers we recommend have mobile versions of their desktop clients. You can use a mobile-focused VPN app to ensure greater data privacy designed for your whole device. Mobile VPNs also generally have a smaller memory footprint and require less processing power than desktop VPNs, so they tend to yield faster connection speeds and don't eat up your battery as quickly. Keep in mind that most mobile VPN clients will use a lighter form of encryption than a desktop client to achieve those smartphone speeds. Be sure to check your VPN apps' settings to ensure you're using the apps' strongest encryption if your privacy needs are heightened. Our top three VPN picks all have excellent, easy-to-use mobile VPN app options for their services. Some VPNs will only work with one type of mobile platform — like iOS or Android — and some are universally compatible. To find the right mobile VPN for you, check out our mobile-specific VPN guides below. We routinely update them with our retesting information, so check back often. VPNs are perfectly legal to use in most countries. There's nothing wrong with taking steps to protect your privacy online, and you shouldn't have to worry that using a VPN as part of that process will get you in any kind of legal trouble. There are countries where VPNs are either banned or outright illegal. If you're using a VPN in a country like China, Iran, Oman, Russia, Turkmenistan, UAE or Belarus, you may find yourself in legal trouble. The irony here is that these are the countries where internet censorship and surveillance are most common. In those countries, you'll need to make sure you use a VPN that providesstrong obfuscationso your VPN traffic is disguised as ordinary HTTPS traffic, meaning government entities won't even know you're using a VPN in the first place. You won't run into any trouble with the law for using a VPN across most of the world. One important reminder: VPNs are legal in most places, butengaging in illegal activity online is still illegal regardless of whether you're using a VPN. If you live in a country that censors its media or are traveling to one,geo-restricted contentis a pain. You can use a VPN to circumvent censorship or access your home country's normal media content for anonline streaming servicelike Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video or Disney Plus. Pick a VPN that lets you manually select which country you want to connect through and has something calledobfuscation. (Our top three picks offer this.) You don't always need to use the obfuscation feature to unblock Netflix, but since streaming services actively try to block VPN connections, obfuscation can help because it disguises your VPN traffic as regular internet traffic. If you're looking to try out other VPNs, choose one with a large number of IP addresses, preferably 10,000 or more. This is because one of the ways Netflix and others block VPNs is by blacklisting known VPN IPs, and if your VPN has tens of thousands of IPs, there's a better chance that you'll be able to connect to an IP address that Netflix hasn't flagged. Once you have your VPN installed, connect to the country whose content you wish to view, restart your browser and go to the streaming site. If your VPN is working, the site should treat you as a resident of your selected country and serve you content assigned to that audience. If you're still having trouble, you can try using incognito mode on your browser or try clearing your cookies and cache. The best VPNs for Netflix — and streaming in general — all let you access geo-restricted content buffer-free. Your first and most apparent indication that your VPN is working is that your IP address will change and your location will be registered as that of the VPN server you're connecting through. You can check this on a site likewhatismyipaddress.com. You'll also want to make sure your VPN is protecting your privacy and not leaking any of your data outside of the VPN tunnel, thus exposing it to your ISP and other entities that may be monitoring your online activity. You can check for leaks by going to a site like dnsleaktest.com or ipleak.net. If your location is registered as the VPN server location and your leak tests turn up negative, then you know your VPN is working to protect your privacy. A remote-access VPN uses public infrastructure like the internet to provide remote users secure access to their network. This is particularly important for organizations and their corporate networks. It's crucial when employees connect to a public hotspot and use the internet for sending work-related emails. A VPN client on the user's computer or mobile device connects to a VPN gateway on the company's network. This gateway will typically require the device to authenticate its identity. It will then create a network link back to the device that allows it to reach internal network resources such as file servers, printers and intranets as if it were on the same local network. This is when the VPN technology uses a gateway device to connect the entire network in one location to a network in another location. The majority of site-to-site VPNs that connect over the internet use IPsec. IPsec-based encryption protocols are often considered by VPN specialists to be less secure against modern surveillance. Rather than using the public internet, it is also normal to use multiprotocol label-switching clouds as the main transport for site-to-site VPNs. VPNs are often defined between specific computers, and in most cases, they are servers in separate data centers. New hybrid-access situations have now transformed the VPN gateway in the cloud, typically with a secure link from the cloud service provider into the internal network. The best VPN for you depends on your needs when using a VPN. Generally, ExpressVPN is the best VPN overall based on our testing. But we also recommend NordVPN (the best VPN for speed), Surfshark (the best VPN on a budget), Proton (the best free VPN), Mullvad (the best VPN for privacy) and PIA (the best cheap VPN alternative). VPNs for crucial privacy and securityIf you're a journalist, a lawyer or a professional in any other privacy-sensitive field, forget about speed and price when choosing a VPN. Focus, instead, entirely on security. Your VPN may be somewhat slower but, for both VPNs and presidential motorcades, speed is always the trade-off for privacy. Avoid free VPNs andbrowser-based VPNs. If you're concerned with government monitoring in your current country, choose a VPN headquartered outside of the country you're currently in, and avoid choosing a VPN with a jurisdiction in an allied country. For example, US journalists should avoid VPNs with a jurisdiction inthe US or other Five Eyes countries. Keep an eye on encryption: Your VPN should offer a protocol called OpenVPN TCP (for its mobile apps, IKEv2 is fine). Right now, the VPN we recommend most for critical privacy isExpressVPN. VPNs for working from homeIf you're working from home, you may be sharing your internet connection with multiple devices and family members or roommates. That's a lot of simultaneous connections to a VPN and a lot of drag on a network. Pick a VPN that lets you use one subscription on as many devices as possible and has excellent speeds so your Wi-Fi isn't bogged down. If your job involves handling sensitive information like financial or medical records, your priority VPN criteria is security. Our top three VPN picks are the most secure we've found, and each has a different number of connections they'll allow for a base-level subscription. Depending on your budget and home office requirements, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN are all great options for working from home. There are a few other factors worth considering for a home office VPN, so check out our guide topicking the right VPN for working at home. VPNs for gamingMost VPNs are chosen based on having a good balance of speed, security and cost. If you want a VPN specifically to connect to game servers in another country, speed is everything. Free VPNs won't be fast enough. Fortunately, high-end security won't be a cost driver, which gives you moreoptions at modest prices. Sinceall VPNs reduce speed— many by half or more — that means picking one from the set thatperformed best in our speed tests. In our latest tests, NordVPN took the lead as the fastest VPN, although you can get excellent speeds through Surfshark via the WireGuard protocol and with ExpressVPN. If you're focused on VPNs for game consoles, look atour best VPNs for Xboxandour primer on installing them. Before choosing the one right for your needs, visit the VPN's official website to see whether they offer servers specifically aimed at gaming in the countries where you most want to connect to other players.","Streaming, gaming or traveling?

441,Norton Secure VPN Review 2024: Too Few Features and Too Many Privacy Questions,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. Norton Secure VPN carries a recognizable name in cybersecurity, but it doesn’t come close to competing withCNET’s picks for best VPN. Over several weeks in November and December 2024, ItestedNorton Secure VPN across various devices and operating systems. I analyzed its performance, reviewed its privacy policies, conducted over 160 speed tests, checked for leaks, assessed its value, and communicated with company representatives via email and videoconference. I found a VPN that falls short in many key areas. While it seems aimed at the average VPN user, it lacks features that would appeal to casual users -- like support for streaming devices. It’s also not a strong choice for power users or those withcritical privacy needs, such as journalists, activists, attorneys, physicians or whistleblowers. Overall app security seems to be mostly OK, with the exception of some concerning IPv6 leaks under certain conditions. Excessive data collection and sharing practices also drag the service down. There are lots of excellent VPN options out there, but based on my testing, Norton Secure VPN isn’t one of them. Here’s what you need to know about this disappointing VPN. All VPNs willslow your connection speedssomewhat, with many cutting your speeds in half. Norton Secure VPN falls into the underperforming category with a disappointing 49% speed loss in my November 2024 tests. That’s significantly worse thanfast VPNslikeNordVPN(11% speed loss),Mullvad(13%) andSurfshark(17%), all of which outperformed Norton in our latest speed tests. Because Norton VPN’sprotocol selection optionsvary from one device to another, I wasn’t able to conduct my speed tests as I normally do with other VPN providers. Typically, I would do a direct comparison between speeds onMacOSandWindowsand calculate the average speed loss using both OpenVPN and WireGuard (or equivalent proprietary protocol) on each operating system. However, Norton Secure VPN’s MacOS app only offers its proprietary Mimic protocol along with IKEv2/IPSec, so I couldn't test OpenVPN or WireGuard speeds on MacOS. I ruled out testing Norton’s speeds on MacOS with Mimic because it’s a closed-source proprietary protocol that I wouldn’t recommend using, given that it leaked my IPv6 address on every single one of Norton’s 29 country locations (more on that later). I was left with IKEv2/IPSec as the protocol to test Norton’s speeds on MacOS. On Windows, I tested Norton’s speeds using WireGuard and OpenVPN. The results were still underwhelming across the board. Using IKEv2/IPSec on MacOS, I calculated an average speed loss of 36% -- slower speeds than I would typically expect to see from a quality VPN on Mac. On Windows using WireGuard, I registered a slightly better 31% speed loss, but that’s still pretty slow -- especially considering that WireGuard speeds tend to be quick. What came as a shock was the massive 80% speed loss I registered using OpenVPN on Windows. While OpenVPN is a bulky protocol and its speeds tend to be somewhat slower than newer, more lightweight protocols like WireGuard or Lightway, I didn’t expect OpenVPN to cut speed by anywhere close to 80% for most VPNs. Along with overall sluggish speeds, I noticed inconsistent performance during my tests, particularly when connecting to distant servers in locations like Australia and Singapore. I noticed that my speeds would often spike or dip by a few hundred megabits per second from one test to the next, regardless of which VPN protocol or operating system I was using. As expected, the fastest speeds I registered were through nearby locations in the US and in the UK and Europe. Those speeds were fairly uniform for the most part, but I did notice inconsistencies here and there. Speeds to Australia and Singapore were more volatile, ranging anywhere from a 20Mbps drip to about 250Mbps on my 370Mbps internet connection. Norton Secure VPN’s speeds are generally fast enough for most online activities, but the inconsistent speed performance may have a noticeable effect on your online experience, depending on what you’re doing. For example, I noticed a bit of choppiness during streaming sessions at times while connected to Norton VPN servers. If all you’re after is the fastest possible speed from Norton, you can try using the Mimic protocol, but I wouldn’t recommend using it if you value your privacy. Key takeaway:I wasn’t overly impressed with Norton VPN’s inconsistent and sluggish speed performance. You can try using the Mimic protocol to give your speeds a boost, but you may be doing so at risk to your own privacy. Norton Secure VPN underdelivers, but charges a premium for the service. You only have one subscription option with Norton Secure VPN (the company’s base VPN plan), which covers up to five devices and costs $40 for the first year and $80 per year thereafter. This is in contrast to most VPNs, which typically offer subscription plans of varying lengths -- usually monthly, annual and two-year plans. I appreciate Norton VPN’s transparency on its renewal prices and its relatively straightforward pricing, but some users may prefer more options to choose from,depending on their budgetand how long they’re willing to commit. At first glance, Norton Secure VPN’s price may not seem too exorbitant, but when compared to the pricing and overall features and performance of our top VPN picks, Norton’s offering falls very short for the price. Charging $80 per year to protect a meager allowance of five devices with a buggy VPN that only offers support for four operating systems, has servers in a mere 29 countries and is light on features is outrageous. As a comparison, Surfshark allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices at a time for just $60 per year and is by leaps and bounds superior to Norton Secure VPN's service. Or you can get three years withPrivate Internet Access(PIA) for the same $80 price that Norton VPN charges for one year for five-device protection. The difference is that PIA, like Surfshark, allows you to connect as many devices at a time as you want and is tremendously more robust than Norton VPN. If you choose to go with Norton Secure VPN, the signup and install process is straightforward, although you’ll have to provide your full name, email address and physical address to create an account, regardless of what payment option you go with. You can purchase a subscription using a credit or debit card, PayPal or Google Pay, which should work for most folks, but you’re out of luck if you want to use other payment options including crypto for a more private transaction. Most other VPNs offer many additional payment options to cater to a wider variety of customers. Once you’ve signed up, you’ll have the option to download the app to devices running Windows,Android, MacOS oriOS. Norton Secure VPN doesn’t offer support forLinuxorrouter setups, nor does it have apps for streaming devices likeApple TV,Fire TVor Android TV. This diminishes Norton Secure VPN’s overall value and makes it a poor choice forstreamingenthusiasts and a total no-go for Linux users and anyone looking for whole-network VPN protection from a router setup. However, Norton representatives told me that the company is planning on adding support for routers and streaming devices sometime in the future. But with most worthwhile VPN services already offering support for routers, Linux and streaming devices, Norton lags far behind, even though it’s been around for close to seven years already. My disappointment with Norton Secure VPN doesn’t end with pricing. The app, although simple to use, proved to be buggy during my tests. A few hiccups I encountered while using Norton Secure VPN’s apps: While the bugginess I encountered during testing didn’t completely debilitate the app’s functionality, it was an annoyance and not what I would expect from software in 2024 developed by a company as established as Norton. I understand that no software is perfect and that even the best VPN apps can run into issues, but Norton’s VPN app was buggier than most. Otherwise, Norton Secure VPN’s apps are simple to use, but sparse on features. The iOS app is almost entirely devoid of features altogether. Other than on/off toggles for automatic connections and an ad tracking blocker, the only action you can take on the iOS app is to select and connect to a server location. The MacOS app is slightly better because it adds akill switchand protocol selection. Norton VPN’s Android and Windows apps offer essentially the same feature set, including what’s in the iOS and MacOS apps, plussplit tunneling. The Android and Windows apps allow you to connect via WireGuard, Mimic and OpenVPN, whereas the iOS app only connects via IKEv2/IPSec and the MacOS app allows you to choose between IKEv2/IPSec and Mimic. All of the individual features worked well and as expected during my tests, but I was left wanting more. There’s nodouble-hopfeature, no threat protection, noTorover VPN, no support for Linux or streaming devices and a pretty tiny server network -- basically nothing that makes Norton Secure VPN stand out from the crowd. And while you have the option to connect to the fastest location based on where you are, you still have to click on the dropdown menu to access the option. Most VPNs offer quick access to the fastest or most optimal location right from the home screen. Even extremely basic features like the ability to designate favorite servers or select specific city-level servers are nowhere to be found in Norton Secure VPN’s apps. When I tested Norton Secure VPN’s streaming capabilities, I was able to access content from multiple internationalNetflixlibraries, along with content from other popular streaming services includingMax,Hulu,Amazon Prime Video,Disney PlusandApple TV Plus. While I was pleased with Norton VPN’s streaming capabilities on MacOS, iOS, Windows and Android, I wouldn’t recommend using the service for streaming because it doesn’t offer support for streaming devices,smart TVsor routers, and you can only choose from 29 server locations. Most VPNs offer at least 60 server locations, with some -- including NordVPN, Surfshark,ExpressVPNandProton VPN-- offering 100 or more. Norton representatives told me in an interview that the company plans on adding additional server locations in the future as well as the ability to select servers at the city-level. If you do end up purchasing a subscription, you have 60 days to claim a full refund if you decide the service isn’t right for you. Key takeaway:Subscribing to Norton Secure VPN is like paying for a five-star service but getting a two-star experience. While the Norton brand may be synonymous with privacy and security, I’m alarmed by the company’s privacy policy and data collection/sharing practices. As outlined in Norton’sGlobal Privacy Statementand itsVPN-specific privacy policy, the company collects a wealth of personal data, including your name, address, email address, phone number, payment information, geolocation data, username and password. Additional data collected includes device identifier, device name and type, aggregate bandwidth usage, connection and application events, timestamps, IP address (temporarily) and license identifier. According to the privacy policies, this data can be shared with partners across Gen Digital’s (Norton’s parent company) family of companies along with other external entities including distributors, resellers, advertising partners, analytics providers, contractors, service providers, social media platforms and public authorities. That’s unsettling and not what I want to see from a company that’s supposed to be protecting my privacy. ExpressVPN collects a minimal amount of data (the extent of which depends on the payment method used) and is controlled solely by ExpressVPN, not its parent company, Kape Technologies. Mullvad takes it a step further and requires no personal information whatsoever to sign up and use its service, confirming that a VPN can be operated without collecting any user data at all. Importantly, Norton Secure VPN says that it “does not log information about where you browse on the internet.” This means that it doesn’t collect or store any data related to what you’re doing online while connected to its server network -- it’s a critical promise that every VPN should make. But, as with any VPN, it’simpossible to verifywith 100% certainty that your VPN isn’t logging your browsing activity. Things like legal cases andindependent no-logs auditscan help, but as with legal cases, no-logs audits can only verify a VPNs claims for a short window in time. For anything outside that window, you just have to take the VPN’s word for it that it’s doing what it says it does. That said, independent audits still serve as important trust signals for VPNs. Norton Secure VPN underwent a privacy audit conducted by US-based cybersecurity firm VerSprite from Feb. 21 to March 8, 2024, with validation retests occurring on April 11 and July 25, 2024. VerSprite’s assessment found that the “overall privacy impact for the Norton Secure VPN Solution, based on technical gaps found during the Technical Privacy Impact Assessment and the potential impact of discovered issues, is low.” That is to say that VerSprite found that the privacy risks are low when using Norton Secure VPN. During the initial assessment, VerSprite found that “under certain conditions sensitive information could be logged which would definitely assist in identifying the VPN users.” However, VerSprite was able to verify during the subsequent validation retests that Norton had fixed the issue -- which highlights how audits can help uncover potential vulnerabilities and help VPN companies shore up their privacy. Norton representatives told me that the company plans to undergo an independent audit on an annual basis, which could help boost the provider’s overall trustworthiness. While Norton Secure VPN’s security seems to be mostly tight (with an audited no-logs policy and secure AES 256-bit encryption), there are a few things that need to be addressed. For one, although representatives told me it’s in the product pipeline, Norton VPN’s iOS app lacks a kill-switch, which is a critical feature that protects your privacy in case the VPN connection drops for any reason. And although Norton’s proprietary Mimic VPN protocol looks good on paper with its strong encryption,obfuscationand quantum protections, it’s still a relatively newer, unproven protocol that leaked my IPv6 address on every server location when I tested the protocol on Mac. An IPv6 leak is a privacy risk because it can open you up to tracking and targeted attacks and expose your true IP address, location and identity. You can work around this by disabling IPv6 on your device, but a good VPN should offer IPv6 leak protection to prevent this from happening in the first place. Norton representatives told me that the company is looking into the issue, so hopefully it gets resolved expeditiously. Notably, I didn’t encounter any DNS leaks during my tests, which is a welcome improvement over the last time my former colleague Rae Hodge reviewed the service. Another thing I took issue with is that Norton’s apps request invasive permissions and have some questionable data collection settings enabled on the MacOS app. UnderPrivacyin theSettingssection of the MacOS app, there are three toggle switches that give you the option to join “Norton Community Watch” (which automatically forwards threat data to NortonLifeLock), share app usage data (which allows Norton to analyze app-usage data) and opt to share app-usage data with Norton so you can receive offers for “related products and services [Norton thinks] you’ll find useful.” Conveniently (for Norton), these “privacy” settings are all enabled by default on the MacOS app -- so be sure to toggle them off if you care about your privacy. Norton representatives were unable to confirm in an interview what app-usage data was being collected in this case. I also didn’t appreciate that Norton constantly prompted me to enable location services on my devices, which it claims is so that the app can verify the safety of the Wi-Fi networks you’re connected to. Naturally, I opted to ignore these requests and not to provide Norton access to my precise location, but what was especially irritating is that there doesn't seem to be a way to disable future prompts without actually giving Norton access to your location. Key takeaway:Norton Secure VPN doesn’t seem to log user activity -- but that sort of goes out the window when you consider all of the other personal data that the company collects and shares. Norton’s data collection and sharing practices, along with its US jurisdiction and IPv6 leaks, disqualify it as an option for privacy-critical VPN users. If you’ve made it this far and haven’t already made the decision to go with a different VPN provider, I’ll leave you with this: I wouldn’t recommend Norton Secure VPN for any use case. It’s okay for streaming if you do all of your streaming on your laptop and/or mobile devices, but so are a whole host of far superior and often cheaper VPN options (thatdooffer support for streaming devices). And if you’re at all concerned about your privacy, the app may leave your IPv6 address exposed, and the company has no qualms about scooping up your personal data, sharing it with others and insisting on knowing your precise location at all times. Any of the services on our list of thebest VPNsare a better option.","With plenty of great VPN options out there, I’d skip Norton Secure VPN for now.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/norton-secure-vpn-review/,

Prime members can alsodownload movies and TV showsfor watching later offline. If a show or movie you want to watch is not included as part of your basic Prime subscription, you can subscribe to premium channels such as HBO, Showtime and Starz for $5 to $15 a month, with no need for cable or satellite service. Music lovers can upgrade to Amazon Music Unlimited to get a library of 90 million songs that can be streamed to multiple devices for $9 a month or $89 a year. If you don't need your purchase to be delivered quickly, you can opt out of two-day or shorter delivery options by selecting ""no-rush shipping"" and receive your package in about six days. In return for your patience, Amazon will give you rewards. There's no standard for no-rush shipping rewards -- they vary from item to item -- but they generally provide discounts on products and services that you might buy from Amazon. Some common rewards are $1 credits for Amazon digital services like movies, music and ebooks, $3 coupons for Amazon'sHappy Belly-branded snacks, $10 to $20 off TV or furniture purchases and $10 to $20 offAmazon Home Services. The value of no-rush shipping will depend on whether you'll use any of the rewards.

Return what you don't want before the trial week is over, and you'll only pay for the items that you keep. Eligible products are indicated on Amazon with a ""Try Before You Buy"" icon.

454,9 of the Best Peacock Shows to Stream Right Now,"If you're all caught up on Peacock's buzzy new thriller series The Day of the Jackal -- includingthat wild finale-- you may be interested in exploring more original shows on the streaming service. There are plenty of other highly rated options to consider. Here are nine standout TV series to help you make the most of your Peacock subscription. Each of them scores around 70 or higher on Metacritic. Peacock costs $8 per month or $80 per year for the ad-supported version (eligibleComcast and Instacart subscriberscan stream for free). Read more:Streaming Guide December 2024: You're Gonna Need These Services If a 10-episode show with Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, elaborate assassinations and a cat-and-mouse game sounds like a binge you want to go on, this thriller awaits on Peacock. Redmayne plays an assassin who can hide his identity like a chameleon and execute targets from more than two miles away. Lashana Lynch also stars as a British intelligence officer attempting to stop him. You can look forward to a second season of the show, which reimagines the 1971 novel and 1973 film of the same name. Two seasons of deception in, The Traitors' mix of reality TV personalities, creative challenges and secret identities is still extremely enjoyable. Based on the Dutch reality series De Verraders, the show rounds up cunning game-players who try to win a cash prize by succeeding in challenges and identifying the ""traitors"" among them. Any backstabbers in the group that aren't outed in time take all the moolah. What if you could always tell when someone is lying? That's the talent possessed by Natasha Lyonne's Charlie in Poker Face, a 10-episode detective series created by Knives Out writer and director Rian Johnson. Each episode introduces a crime and wraps things up before the next entry starts. With the charisma of Russian Doll star Lyonne and an eye-popping list of guest stars such as Adrien Brody, Chloë Sevigny and Rhea Perlman, Poker Face is thrilling, addictive TV. Ed Helms of The Office, The Hangover and other beloved comedies stars in this sitcom focused on the small town of Rutherford Falls. Helms plays Nathan, a descendant of the town's founder, and an advocate for his family history. The show is charming and funny (even as it tackles weighty subjects) and it's also been lauded for its Indigenous representation on-screen andin the writer's room. This British comedy spotlighting an all-female Muslim punk band is extremely fun and boasts a cast of talented young people. The series kicks off introduces 26-year-old Amina, a secretly skilled yet shy musician. Enter Lady Parts, an uber cool group in need of a new guitarist. Time spent with these ladies flies by, making We Are Lady Parts a Peacock pick worth your streaming hours. If you're a sucker for resort-set TV shows that will get you speculating (White Lotus season 3 can't come soon enough), you should check out this Peacock series. Cristin Milioti and William Jackson Harper star as a married couple who begin to explore the disappearances of two young people more than a decade earlier. Pack a trunk for paradise and get ready for the twisty story to take hold. Artificial Intelligence is inescapable these days, so no wonder it's a major part of a Peacock series. The show follows a nun (not named Mrs. Davis) who tries to take down an all-powerful AI (named Mrs. Davis). For a wild show with lots of ideas, don't miss this risk-taking, globe-trotting Peacock series. Wondery's popular 2018 true crime podcast Dr. Death led me to think in disbelief, ""How didnobodyput a stop to this guy?"" Watching Peacock's TV adaptation of the podcast is a similarly maddening affair. Christopher Duntsch, a Dallas neurosurgeon, killed two patients he operated on andinjured 31 others. Watch for a captivating, spine-chilling tale about a surgeon's horrific crime spree that lasted far longer than it should have. No, it's not an original Peacock series. But I'd be doing anyone reading this a huge disservice if I didn't mention that the seven-season sitcom focused on the zany occupants of Pawnee, Indiana, has a home on Peacock. This goofy, big-hearted show has drawn genuine belly laughs out of me countless times. It's buoyant, witty and just as good on rewatch. The point is, you'll want to keep this one handy for a mood refresh when you can't get creepy Dr. Death and his spooky scalpel out of your head.",Finished The Day of the Jackal?

455,Best Web Hosting Services for 2024,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. What to consider  Hosting types There are several types of web hosting, including shared hosting, VPS hosting, cloud hosting and dedicated hosting. Shared web hosting is generally the cheapest but slowest to load, and stores your website on a server alongside many other sites. VPS, cloud and dedicated hosting are all faster but more expensive than shared hosting. Security You'll want your site to be secure. We recommend secure socket layer certification, a firewall to block malware, DDoS protection, brute force protection and automatic backups. Uptime Uptime is how much time your website spends online, so you'll want this to be as close to 100% as possible. Most web hosts provide a 99.9% uptime guarantee, meaning your website won't go down for more than nine hours per year. Some web hosts even deliver 99.99% uptime guarantees. Customer service Your web host should offer customer support via multiple channels, like live chat, email and over the phone, maybe even over social media. A comprehensive support center with detailed FAQs and troubleshooting guides is ideal as well. Pricing Web hosting prices often start at $5 a month for shared hosting, but can go as high as $540 or more for dedicated hosting. VPS hosting often costs between $2 to $110 per month. Often, web hosts give you discounted pricing upfront with future price hikes, and you can usually get the lowest pricing by signing up for a longer-term contract, like two or three years.

WordPress users will enjoy the WordPress acceleration through LiteSpeed, automated WordPress updates and pre-built site templates available on most plans. Hostinger also offers a website builder with over 150 designer-built templates. The website builder also includes AI site generation tools; all you need to do is enter some basic information about your website, choose a color scheme and let Hostinger build your site. Hostinger is ideal if you want access to great WordPress features and/or a high-quality website builder for affordable prices. However, Hostinger's customer support is only available via live chat, so you might want to choose a different company if you prefer to communicate with customer support via email or phone. Pricing All Hostinger plans come with steep discounts, typically based on a four-year contract, longer than the one to three years required to get an introductory discount from other hosts. You may have to pay more than the prices listed below if you choose a shorter contract. SCORE Ionos is a high-quality web host that performed remarkably well in ourhands-on Ionos review. You can get several types of hosting from Ionos including shared hosting, WordPress hosting, e-commerce hosting, VPS hosting and dedicated hosting. Ionos plans include top-notch security, starting with SSL certification, firewall protection and DDoS protections. Ionos also offers malware scanning and automated daily backups for quickly restoring your site if something goes wrong. On top of all of this, Ionos offers some of the best customer service in the industry, with 24/7 access to support via live chat or phone. Both live chat and phone support were fast, polite and helpful during our tests. There are also fourteen international numbers for users around the world. You'll also get a personal consultant who can be reached by phone or live chat from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST, although you may be directed to another support agent if your consultant is working on another case when you reach out. Ionos is a great choice if you're looking to create a hobby site or blog thanks to its combination of great features, affordable long-term pricing and excellent customer service. Ionos' prices start lower than most other web hosting services for similar services, but you must sign up for a three-year plan to access the best discounts. The price increases on renewal -- significantly so for some plans -- but most plans are still more affordable than their counterparts at other popular web hosts. The plans referenced below offer the lowest long-term pricing. Some mid-range plans may offer a steeper introductory discount but will cost significantly more than the plans referenced below on renewal. SCORE SiteGroundis known for its WordPress-optimized hosting plans andaward-winning customer serviceavailable 24/7 via phone, live chat and email. You can get WordPress, WooCommerce and cloud hosting through SiteGround. All SiteGround plans are optimized with guided WordPress setup tools, specialized caching tools for improving site speed and proprietary plugins for optimizing your website's speed and security. SiteGround performs automated updates to the core WordPress software, themes and plugins, with options to delay updates or even skip a specific release update if you need to prepare your site. SiteGround security goes beyond the standard SSL certification and firewall protection with a proprietary anti-bot system that claims to block millions of threats every day. You'll also get automated daily backups so you can quickly restore your site if something goes wrong. All of this is great, but the best thing about SiteGround is its customer support. There are comprehensive resources for learning how to perform most web hosting and site management tasks yourself. If you can't figure it out on your own, SiteGround offers fast, helpful service via support ticket, live chat and phone. SiteGround is a great option if you want to WordPress website without worrying about managing the WordPress software yourself. The long-term pricing is high for a personal site -- the lowest-tier plan rises to $18 a month on renewal -- but totally reasonable if you're building a business website. SCORE A2 Hostingoffers shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress, reseller and cloud hosting, including tiered options within each plan. Shared hosting, for example, offers plans labeled Startup, Drive, Turbo Boost and Turbo Max. These additional plans give customers more options to choose from to better fit their needs and allow customers to scale their operations as needed. One of the biggest benefits of A2 Hosting is the comprehensive security, which includes SSL certificate, dual firewalls, a virus scanner, DDoS protection and brute force defense. Most plans also include automated backups, although this isn't available on the lowest-tier plan. OurA2 Hosting reviewshowed that A2 Hosting also has great tools for beginners, including a guided WordPress setup process and site assistant. Server performance was also good, with 100% uptime during our week of testing -- exceeding the official 99.9% uptime guarantee -- and good overall site speed. Customer support can be slow when contacted via support ticket or phone. A2 Hosting is a great choice if you're completely new to website building and WordPress. A2 Hosting pricing is about average at first glance, but renewal pricing is relatively high when compared to other popular web hosts. When you factor in all of the security features and additional features like the site assistant and unlimited email hosting, A2 Hosting is worth the price. SCORE GreenGeeksoffers shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress and reseller hosting plans. Each plan offers tiered options that let you scale up as your site's needs grow. Some plans are managed but at a higher cost. Each plan also includes a website builder so you don't have to build your site from scratch. Every GreenGeeks plan includes a slew of security features like SSL certificates, DDoS protection, daily backups, malware cleanups and more to helpprotect your site. GreenGeeks says it checks its servers every 10 seconds for any issues, while other services might check every 30 seconds, every minute or longer. For more direct customer support, GreenGeeks offers 24/7 chat support. You can also email GreenGeeks support, and the company says you can expect a resolution in about 15 to 20 minutes. The other thing that stands out about GreenGeeks is its commitment to the environment: for every hosting account, GreenGeeks plants a tree, and GreenGeeks also creates three times the amount of energy used through wind power credits. GreenGeeks is a great choice if you want to offset the environmental costs of hosting your website. GreenGeeks' pricing is average compared to other web hosting services. Most of the lowest prices from GreenGeeks require a three-year contract paid in full upfront. Other contracts are available at an increased price per month, but must also be paid in full upfront. AccuWeb Hostingoffers shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress, app, reseller and cloud hosting options. Customers can also choose which of AccuWeb Hosting's global data centers will host their data. This means if you anticipate that most of your traffic will come from outside the US, you can choose to store your site in a different location so your site loads quicker for non-US visitors. AccuWeb Hosting offers top-notch security on all plans, including SSL certification,free antivirustools and free daily backups. AccuWeb servers are also LiteSpeed enhanced for improved speed and performance. The other major benefit of AccuWeb Hosting is affordability. Specifically, WordPress hosting starts at just $2.75 a month and the lowest-tier plan doesn't become more expensive on renewal, something unique to AccuWeb. AccuWeb is ideal if you're looking to build a personal or hobby WordPress site and you want to make it work on a tight budget. Some AccuWeb Hosting plans, like shared plans, are a little higher than other services, while mid-level plans, like VPS plans, are cheaper than other services. Introductory prices for most hosting types are only available with a three-year term, but the price increases on renewal are reasonable when compared to other popular hosts. Finding the right web-hosting service can help you launch a blog or a website for your small business. The most common types of hosting areshared hosting,virtual private server hostingand dedicated hosting. Shared hosting is typically the most basic, and the least expensive, type of hosting. Continuing the art example, shared hosting is like a small gallery presented in a coffee shop. Yes, the art you created is there, but so is art by other people. Shared hosting is similar. You're usually charged a few bucks a month to house your site, but you don't get a lot of resources to help you take care of your site. These plans usually cost between$2 and $20 a month. VPS hostingis a step up from shared hosting and is a little bit more expensive. Here, your art is stored in a gallery downtown. Other art is still stored and displayed alongside yours, but unlike shared hosting, each artist has their own booth within the gallery. With VPS hosting, you get more resources which allows you to handle more traffic and display more items. These plans usually cost between $2 and $110 a month. Dedicated hosting is when you house your site on a whole server without anyone else. This is like having the entire art gallery to yourself. Everything there is your art and you get dedicated people to help take care of your art. These plans are the most expensive, but you get the most resources. Dedicated hosting plans usually cost between $47 and $540 a month. Your web host should offer a variety of shared and VPS hosting plans to accommodate your site as it grows. You may want to choose a host that also has dedicated hosting options if you're planning to grow your site into an enterprise business, but this limits your options -- a lot of the best web hosts only offer shared and VPS hosting. You may also want to consider cloud hosting if you want to start a business website. You can learn more about cloud hosting -- and all the other hosting types mentioned here -- in our guide abouttypes of web hostingfor more details. It's important tosecure your siteso you don't compromise the personal information of your site's visitors or yourself. At a minimum, your web hosting should include two security features: Many of the best web hosts also provide brute force and DDoS protection, malware scanning/repair and automated backups. Uptime is the amount of time your site spends online. The industry standard site uptime is 99.9%, which means your site won't go down for more than nine hours per year. Some hosts provide uptime guarantees as high as 99.99%, which means your site won't go down for more than 56 minutes per year. Note that this guarantee only refers to server performance; your site may still go down due to other reasons, such as being hacked or a botched WordPress update. You could run into an issue with your site at any time, so choosing a web hosting service that can give you 24/7 customer service is vital. Email support is good, chat support is better and phone support is best. Addressing any issues or outages as quickly as possible ensures your site is reachable and your visitors have a good experience. Web hosting pricing can be confusing. For example, a service might list its lowest shared hosting price as $5 a month. That price is a promotional rate and comes attached to a one-year contract. At the end of the contract, the price reverts to its regular price of $10 a month, double what you were paying. With that in mind, shared hosting can cost anywhere between $2 and $23 per month, VPS can cost between $2-$110 a month and dedicated hosting can cost between $47-$540 a month on average. Choosing the right web hosting service for you can be an intimidating task. That's why we've carefully combed through these hosts' websites, plus reviews of these hosts, to determine their offerings and the quality of their services. We are also in the process of testing and reviewing web hosting companies with our newframework for testing web hosts. This involves researching plan options and testing site setup, speed, uptime and customer service. Notes from these tests are being added to the appropriate listings as new reviews are published. Data centers are filled with servers that can house hundreds of websites. The following services aren't as robust as our top picks, but they're still reasonable offerings. Some specialize in one type of hosting, likeWordPress hosting, so they're not ideal for hosting a non-WordPress site or accommodating its long-term growth. Others have extremely high renewal costs or lack certain types of customer service. Pay close attention to the details when choosing one of these hosts. Namecheap offers some of the cheapest pricing plans. Month-to-month plans in particular are less expensive compared with monthly plans from other services. Some other services might offer monthly shared hosting plans for $20, but all Namecheap monthly shared hosting plans cost less than $10. Namecheap also offers VPS, dedicated, WordPress and reseller hosting plans. Namecheap has a 99.9% uptime guarantee for VPS and reseller plans, as well as a 100% uptime guarantee for most shared, VPS and dedicated plans. Each Namecheap plan comes with a free virus scanner, two-factor authentication and DDoS protection to help secure your data and your visitors' data. SSL certificates are free for one year. After that year, you can buySSL certificatesthrough NameCheap for $6 per year with a five-year contract. Namecheap offers 24/7 email and chat support but no phone support. Namecheap plans start at$1.48 per month. GoDaddy offers shared, VPS, dedicated and WordPress hosting plans, a 99.9% uptime guarantee and 24/7 customer support by phone or chat. GoDaddy is also the only web host on this list you can contact via text, and we found customer service highly responsive during ourGoDaddy review. GoDaddy also had impressive server performance. The big drawback of GoDaddy is that some security features are inconsistent. For example, SSL certificates are included with all shared hosting plans, but with the lower-tiered shared plan, you have to purchase an SSL certificate after one year no matter how long your hosting contract is. SSL certificates are also a paid option in lower-tiered VPS and dedicated hosting plans, but they're included in the higher-tiered options. GoDaddy Web Hosting plans start at$6 a month. HostGatoroffers shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress, eCommerce and reseller hosting plans with tiered options. Most of HostGator's plans include a firewall withDDoS protectionsand SSL certification for at least one year. Some plans come with automated backups, butHostGator writesthat anyone with ""critical business information or important data areSTRONGLYencouraged to seek a third-party backup service…"" (emphasis theirs). Undermining your own backup system is an odd choice. In theory, customer support from HostGator is available via chat, email or phone 24/7. Some plans limit the types of customer service you can access and we experienced inconsistent service across support channels during ourHostGator review. HostGator pricing starts at$3.75 a month. HostPapahas global data centers, so you can choose the best data center to reach your visitors the quickest. Hosting options include shared, VPS, managed and unmanaged WordPress hosting, reseller hosting and PapaCare, which is similar to managed shared hosting. HostPapa has free SSL certificates, DDoS protection and other security features included in each plan, a 99.9% uptime guarantee and 24/7 phone, chat and email support. The lack of a dedicated hosting option means that if your site grows too large, you'll have to migrate to another service. In addition, renewal pricing isn't listed on plan pages and can be quite expensive. Moreover, some features, like automated backups and a security tool, are automatically added for an additional charge during check-out. These features are included in higher-tier plans, but not in all plans. HostPapa plans start at$3 per month. Hostwindsoffers unlimited storage and bandwidth, as well as unlimited free business email accounts with each plan. It offers shared, managed and unmanaged VPS, dedicated, reseller and cloud hosting plans, as well as a business-centered shared hosting plan it calls business hosting. Hostwinds has a99.9999% uptime guarantee, which is above average, and it offers 24/7 support via live chat, email and support ticket; there are no hours listed for the support phone number. Hostwinds plans also come with free SSL certificates and free nightly backups. In comparison with other services, Hostwinds isn't as forthcoming with information on other features or plan differences. Usually, services show detailed charts that lay out what features come with plans. Hostwinds' shared chart, for example, lists only bandwidth, disk space and how many domains come with each plan. Hostwinds plans start at$5.24 a month. Bluehostspecializes in WordPress hosting and many of its plans include custom themes and other WordPress tools. It offers shared, VPS, dedicated hosting, managed and unmanaged WordPress hosting, as well as an option called Online Store that includes additional e-commerce tools with each plan. All plans include two-factor authentication and anti-spam protection. You'll also get an SSL certificate, but it's only free for the first year on the lowest-tier plan; after that, you'll be paying $90 a year. Bluehost customers can call or chat with a customer support representative 24/7. Bluehost doesn't offer an uptime guarantee but instead says it resolves issues within15 minutes of them being reported. It doesn't say how many issues you should expect on average. If your site is down for about 15 minutes a week, your site could be down for about 13 hours a year, which is higher than standard. Bluehost plans start at$3 per month. Glowhost offers shared, cloud VPS, dedicated, semi-dedicated, reseller and what Glowhost calls elastic site hosting, which it compares to a managed VPS plan. Security features include free SSL certificates and McAfee Secure, which is included for free, and customer support is available by phone or chat 24/7. Glowhost also promises 100% network uptime and 99.95% overall uptime. If it doesn't live up to those expectations, you can take advantage of the 91-day money-back guarantee. Glowhost plans start at$3.50 per month. Mochahostoffers shared, VPS, dedicated cloud, WordPress and reseller plans and 24/7 live chat support. Phone support and ticket creation are also available. Free SSL certificates are included in each plan as well, but other security features, like spam and malware filters, come at an additional cost or with more expensive plans. Mochahost plans start at$2 per month, and the renewal prices are affordable too, with the lowest-tier plan renewing at $6.35 a month. InMotion Hostingoffers shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress and reseller hosting with different tiered options for each type of hosting. InMotion Hosting also offers managed hosting services. These services can be purchased for one hour for $90, or you can purchase these services for three months, six months or a year with prices starting at $48 a month. Each plan comes with free SSL certificates, DDoS protections and hack and malware protections. Automatic daily backups are also available, but these are an additional $2.50 a month. All of this looks great, but our review process revealed serious issues with InMotion Hosting, including slow server speeds and a massive one-hour and 12 minutes of downtime during our week of testing. InMotion Hosting customer support was also impossible to get in touch with. Shared hosting at InMotion Hosting starts at$2.70 a monthwhen you choose a three-year plan. Liquid Web: No shared hosting. Security features include an integrated firewall and standard DDoS protections. Offers 100% uptime and 24/7 chat or phonesupportplus you can create tickets. Prices start at$5 a monthfor VPS hosting. Web Hosting Hub: Offers shared and WordPress hosting. Has free SSL certificates but other security features cost extra.

Security features like free SSL certificates and daily backups. Only custom-managed WordPress plans have an uptime guarantee, and the company offers 24/7 chat support, phone support is offered at higher plan levels. Prices start at$25 a month. Kinsta: Offers WordPress, web app, managed database and static site hosting. Security features like free SSL certificates and automatic backups. Has a 99.9% uptime and 24/7 chat support. Prices start at$30 a monthfor WordPress hosting. Web hosting is the act of storing a website's data on a server or series of servers. Imagine a website as a work of art. That art needs to be housed somewhere for people to see, and web hosting is like a gallery where your art can be stored for others to view. There are three common types of web hosting: shared hosting, VPS hosting and dedicated hosting. Shared hosting is the simplest and least expensive type of hosting, often starting at $2-5 a month, with costs kept low by sharing a web server -- and its resources, like bandwidth and data storage -- with other sites.VPS hostingis more advanced, creating a virtual private server with dedicated resources for your site so it can handle more traffic and store more data. VPS hosting packages typically cost between $2 and $110 a month. Dedicated hosting gives you an entire physical server, typically including large amounts of storage and bandwidth. Dedicated hosting plans usually cost between $47 and $540 a month. Check out our guide abouttypes of web hostingfor more details. Some other types of hosting include reseller, cloud and WordPress hosting. Reseller hosting involves subscribing to a web hosting service and selling that space to a person who wants to put a website online, essentially becoming a web host yourself. Cloud hosting stores your data in a network of servers so if anything happens to one server, visitors can still view your site like usual. These are generally used by larger businesses and organizations.WordPress hostingis optimized to use WordPress, a popular system used bymany organizations, offering over 54,000 plugins that make it possible to build any kind of website you can imagine. For gamers, there is alsoMinecraft hosting. Minecraft continues to be one of the most popular games, and hosting a dedicated Minecraft server can ensure you and your friends have your own place in the game to enjoy. Some of the key security features you should be on the lookout for are secure socket layer certificates, DDoS protections and web application firewalls. SSL certificates encrypt and authenticate data sent between servers, machines and applications operating within a network to protect your -- and your visitors' -- information. A DDoS attack is a flood of traffic to your site that overwhelms and shuts down your site, and potentially the sites of others depending on your hosting plan. DDoS protection monitors your site's traffic for anything suspicious and stops DDoS attacks from happening before they cause significant damage. A WAF is a layer of security on your site that filters, monitors and blocks malicious traffic and data from accessing your site. If something looks suspicious, the WAF blocks it. A2 Hosting's shared hosting is the best web hosting for beginners thanks to its guided WordPress setup process and site assistant. A2 Hosting also offers good server performance and excellent live chat support, although phone and email support can be slow.

458,"New 2024 Christmas Movies on Netflix, Hulu and More to Immerse You in the Season","The holidays are great for revisiting classic festive flicks, but you don't need to limit yourself to options from Christmases past.Streaming servicesare loading up the sleigh with merry movies about human-snowman romances, Santa Claus rescue missions and letters to the North Pole gone terribly wrong. With Jack Black, Danny DeVito, Dwayne Johnson, Lindsay Lohan and other big names featured in the holiday fare, there are enough stars to top a ton of Christmas trees. If you plan to spend time in front of the TV this season, check out this list of 2024 Christmas movies you can stream right now. After hitting theaters in mid-November, the action-packed holiday offering Red One has made its streaming service debut. Starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, the PG-13-rated movie involves a globe-trotting quest to rescue Santa Claus. You can tune in to the film on Prime Video to see if these two movie stars ace the mission. Exes on less-than-merry terms are brought together by Christmas after a decade apart in this Netflix movie. Lindsay Lohan and Ian Harding play former daters reunited when their partners -- who are siblings -- host them at a holiday gathering. Will they be able to keep their history a secret? You'll have to tune in to find out. This festive flick stars Ben Stiller as a big-city dweller whose life takes a turn. He leaves Chicago to temporarily look after his four orphaned nephews on a rural farm, and kid-fueled chaos ensues. Real-life siblings play the quartet of boys, and Linda Cardellini stars as a social worker. It's Taron Egerton vs. Jason Bateman in this Netflix airport thriller with enough holiday energy to land it on this list. The showdown takes place when Bateman's enigmatic character urges Egerton's TSA agent to let a bag make it through security and onto a Christmas Eve flight. If you're up for a different kind of holiday flick, leave room in your suitcase for this one. A Netflix holiday release no one saw coming -- but that makes perfect sense -- Hot Frosty stars Lacey Chabert as a small-town woman who meets a hunk with snowman origins. The comedic outing also features The Office's Craig Robinson and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Joe Lo Truglio -- a sheriff and his deputy on the trail of a streaker who may or may not be the community's hottest (and also technically the coldest) new arrival. A Magic Mike–channeling crowd-pleaser, The Merry Gentlemen centers on a big-city dancer out to save her parents' struggling business. The strategy? An all-male revue led by Chad Michael Murray's chiseled handyman. All of this must be accomplished by Christmas, of course. Want to spend Christmas with an adorable little owl? This animated short film on Disney Plus follows the journey of a young bird named Moon, who winds up alone in Rockefeller Plaza during the holidays and befriends a young girl who's also far from home. The voice actors include Jim Gaffigan, Mamoudou Athie, Natasha Lyonne and John C. Reilly. Succession's Brian Cox voicing Santa Claus is one of the draws of this PG-rated animated flick from Love Actually writer and director Richard Curtis. The film is based on three kids' books by Curtis, who co-wrote That Christmas, and it wraps multiple tales in a holiday package. Pop group Pentatonix and Christina Milian feature in this holiday rom-comthat brings festive tunes and chemistry. Milian's character hunts down tickets to a sold-out Pentatonix concert in New York City, hoping to join a guy she had a meet-cute with a year earlier. But a decision to hire a concierge introduces an unexpected second love interest. Paramount Plus' first original Christmas movie, Dear Santa, has a star-studded cast and an envelope-pushing setup: What if a little boy unintentionally addressed a letter to Satan instead of the man with the bag? Jack Black stars as the kid's devilish new acquaintance, and Keegan-Michael Key and Post Malone appear in this unconventional holiday movie that didn't prove very hot with critics. Gerard Butler's St. Nick encounters Emilia Clarke's Christmas-loathing Queen of Hearts in this animated musical film based on the book of the same name by Carys Bexington. This is a holiday pic that can entertain the kids. Danny DeVito and Andie MacDowell star in this Hulu offering set in the Dolomites, Italy. In the merry comedy, a family holds Christmas at an unusual time of year as a 10-year-old girl tries to keep her parents from splitting up. When it comes to new holiday movies, Hallmark has the winter goods. If you don't have cable, you can use Peacock to catch the Countdown to Christmas lineup -- but you'll need to stayon top of the schedule. The streamer offers films live as they air on the Hallmark Channel on the East Coast or the next day on-demand. Just note if you go the on-demand route, the viewing window is limited to three days.",Spend some holly-jolly time on the couch.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/new-2024-christmas-movies-on-netflix-hulu-and-more-to-immerse-you-in-the-season/,

Not for this year, oh dear me no, but for the future, with Bryce Young playing better in his return to the field after being benched earlier this season. The second-year quarterback and former first overall pick will face the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. The Cowboys' season hasn't gone as planned, but they still field a formidable defense, led by All Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, that will pose a tough task for Young and the Panthers' offense. The Cowboys and Panthers kick off in Charlotte at1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) on Fox. Here's how you can watch, even if the game isn't available on your local Fox channel. Bryce Young has recorded 1,572 passing yards and seven TD throws so far this season. This matchup sees the Saints host the Commanders at1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) on Sunday. The game will take place at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, home of the Panthers. If you find yourself unable to view the game locally due toincorrectly applied blackout restrictions, you may need a different way to watch it. That's where using a VPN can come in handy.

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area.

Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US and Canada, as long as you've got a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming.

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game.

One important caveat: In our experience, Fox local affiliates will only be available if your billing address is in one of the18 metropolitan areas covered in Sling's agreement. If you're outside of one of these areas, you're probably better off going with one of the alternate services listed below.

Not to worry, this week's new releases onstreaminghave a bit of everything. I have this habit of telling my kids to shut off YouTube and watch real TV shows (so many reaction videos, so little time, according to one local child in my home) but for parents like me, be warned,   YouTuber MrBeast is branching out to streaming. The first two episodes of his much-talked-about game show, Beast Games, arrive this week on Prime Video. On Netflix, new seasons of the popular romantic drama Virgin River and the animated fantasy series The Dragon Prince drop this week, as does the newest film from Tyler Perry, the historical drama The Six Triple Eight. Stephanie Hsu leads the cast of the new series Laid on Peacock -- expect to see SNL's Chloe Fineman, comedian John Early and musician Finneas O'Connell (better known as Billie Eilish's brother) on the show, too. If you find yourself at home with your parents this week, you can tune in to The 47th Annual Kennedy Center Honors, airing on CBS and Paramount Plus on Dec. 22, or check out Clint Eastwood's Juror #2, which drops on Max..

Dresses will be tried on, bachelor and bachelorette  parties will be had, and some surprising obstacles may just pop up on  the road to marital bliss. With a seventh season already confirmed,  season 6 comes to Netflix on Dec. 19. Callum, Ezran, and their friends and allies try to stop Aaravos and  Claudia once and for all in the seventh and final season of The Dragon  Prince, simply titled ""Dark."" The popular Netflix Family fantasy  adventure series promises to conclude with a thrilling and heartbreaking conclusion to the show's ""second saga,"" which began  with season four. All nine episodes stream on Netflix beginning  Dec. 19. The Six Triple Eight, directed by Tyler Perry, is the true story of the women who made up of the first and only Women's Army Corps unit  of color stationed in Europe during World War II. The 6888th Central Postal Directory, responsible for distributing more than 17 million pieces of mail to U.S. soldiers stationed overseas, was led by Charlity Adams, played by Kerry Washington, who executive-produced the film, too. In the midst of a global conflict, they faced racial discrimination and segregation, all while making sure their work wasn't compromised. The film, which also features Ebony Obsidian, Milauna Jackson, Kylie Jefferson, and Oprah Winfrey, arrives to Netflix Dec. 20. This yearly celebration honors the careers of American legends of  the performing arts, with the 2024 edition enshrining director Francis  Ford Coppola, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, singer-songwriter Bonnie  Raitt, and the Grateful Dead. In a first, the Center also honored a  performance venue -- the historic Apollo Theater in Harlem. Celebrity  presenters and performers are set to include David Letterman, Emmylou  Harris, Dave Chappelle, Sheryl Crow, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese,  and Al Pacino, among many others. The special will air on CBS on Dec. 22 at 8:30 p.m. ET, simulcast on Paramount Plus.

His latest venture brings together 1,000  contestants (a record) who must undergo a slew of challenges in hopes of  snagging the $5 million grand prize (also a record). The show, said to be inspired by Squid Game, has already been mired in controversy thanks to a lawsuit filed against Donaldson by five contestants, but something tells us that won't deter his 332 million YouTube subscribers from tuning in. The first two  episodes stream on Prime Video starting Dec. 19, with eight more  releasing weekly. Following its limited theatrical release, Clint  Eastwood's latest directorial effort comes to Max for all the world to  see. In the taut thriller, family man Justin Kemp (Nicholas  Hoult) finds himself on the jury of a high-profile murder trial, only to  find that he might actually be the killer. A fine supporting cast  includes J.K. Simmons, Zoey Deutch, Kiefer Sutherland, and Toni  Collette -- reuniting with Hoult for the first time since 2002's About a  Boy. The film drops on Max Dec. 20.

466,Break From Basic Christmas Movies and Watch These Alternatives Instead,"Nothing screams the holidays like the scent of pine, sugar cookies and Kevin McCallister's aftershave in the air. Shopping, family gatherings and time off to binge TV also mark the arrival of festive times, and you're probably making a list of movies you'll watch. You can go with standard fare like Home Alone, Elf, The Grinch or anything in theHallmark Channel lineup-- even the newRed One. But how about bucking tradition? We've got a small batch of suggestions to get you inspired to go outside of the typical Christmas movie box, and they range from gangster films to horror flicks to the incredibly sad. Read more:New 2024 Christmas Movies on Netflix, Hulu and More You Can Unwrap Now A classic in any genre, Gremlins deserves to be on your holiday watchlist for its charm, chaos and educational service about Mogwai. Gizmo is cute, but Stripe and his ilk bring destruction and Christmas disaster to your TV screen. Santa Claus may be the star of the season, but Krampus deserves his due. He gets it in this black comedy starring Adam Scott, Toni Collette and Allison Tolman. The film has holiday lights, snow, a family party and a monster. What more could you need? Talk that sass! Released on Christmas Day back in 2015, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight features a blizzardy winter backdrop and a bunch of strangers trapped together at a haberdashery. Armed with guns, slick mouths and hidden agendas, there's no telling who will survive. Sounds like a good time, right? The movie includes Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins and Michael Madsen. A weird phone call to a sorority house sets the stage for this holiday slasher film starring Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon. College students turn up missing -- and worse -- during the holidays, and there seems to be no way to escape. Fire pokers and Christmas carolers are no help here, either. Watch the 1974 original or the 2006 remake on Tubi. Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder feature in this eclectic Tim Burton classic that brings snow, holiday decorations and an isolated yet mild-natured man into the neighborhood. Depp's shear-handed Edward has a special moment with Ryder's Kim on Christmas, but the movie is filled with (somewhat) tender scenes and winter themes. No unconventional holiday movie list would be complete without including Die Hard. That's it. Marlon Brando won an Academy Award for his role as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's gangster gem. This movie may not have your traditional Christmas vibe, but it has a theme of family togetherness along with that famous scene where Michael Corleone and Kay are out holiday shopping. Stream the first film, then follow up with The Godfather II. If you're in the mood for a film with fellowship, love and good music, then The Best Man Holiday fits the bill. But there's tragedy in this story that will have you bawling your eyes out by the end. The star-studded cast stars Morris Chestnut, Monica Calhoun, Sanaa Lathan, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall, Terrence Howard, Nia Long, Harold Perrineau and Melissa De Sousa. Watch it this season if you can handle the sadness. Before Kevin Hart and The Rock's version of Jumanji, there was 1995's original film with Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst and Bonnie Hunt. A board game unleashes magical havoc on a family that's going through some challenges, but they have to work together to outsmart the game. The adventurous movie packs in action, laughs and some sentimental parts. Be sure to pay attention to the Christmas-themed timeline bit in the movie, too. Adam Sandler has a track record when it comes to holiday-themed movies (that includes Hubie Halloween, folks), but Bedtime Stories may be one of his less popular releases. Still, if you like goofy fantasy movies with lessons about being grateful for who and what you have, this one is a family-friendly pick.","No, they're not all horror movies.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/break-from-basic-christmas-movies-and-watch-these-alternatives-instead/,

468,"Origin PC Eon17-X v2 Review: Big, Burly and Loud Custom Gaming Laptop That Costs","CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. If you want the best gaming laptop you can buy, then you must be ready to subject your wallet to some horrors. Your ears, too, in the case of the Origin PC Eon17-X v2. This formidable gaming machine costs a fortune and demands headphones, thanks to its very loud (though very capable) fans that start blasting air over its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU even before your favorite game's introductory cutscene gets a chance to load. At more than $3,500 after a substantial discount, the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 is one of the more expensive gaming laptops we've tested recently, but it's not the fastest. TheAlienware M18 R2still holds that title, but the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 still offers plenty of 3D muscle -- and it has the better display of the two in the form of a 4K, 144Hz panel. If you build the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 to the exact specs of the Alienware M18 R2 we tested, it costs about $250 more, which is a reasonable sum for the superior display. Alienware's 18-inch monster is still the one to beat in terms of raw performance, but the Origin's 4K display is super sharp and saturated, and the laptop can easily dish out triple-digit frame rates for today's demanding titles at their highest quality settings. Since Origin is a boutique PC builder, its laptops are customizable, and it gives you a good amount of leeway to adjust your system to your exact needs and budget -- and you can really push the limit for the latter. The Eon17-X v2 laptop we reviewed costs an eye-opening $3,568, and that's after Origin's $700 discount. But the system builder doesn't slouch on parts; you're getting some of the best components you can stuff into a 17-inch gaming behemoth. Our laptop came with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, which has a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads and runs at 2.2GHz by default (with its turbo clock boost maxing out at 5.8GHz). The CPU is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which ensures that even opening a web browser has a decent chance of making the laptop sound like a passenger jet at takeoff. Our test system also included a near-overkill 64GB of DDR5-4800 memory and 4 terabytes of storage (split across two 2TB SSDs). That's the most memory offered, but far from the most storage, with 4TB and 8TB drives also available and three total M.2 slots. You can choose from one of two 17.3-inch displays: a 2,560x1,440-pixel panel with a 240Hz refresh rate or a 3,840x2,160, 144Hz screen. The former locks you into an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, whereas the latter is the only option for the faster RTX 4090 GPU. We received the latter. It's a better setup, but it'll cost you an extra $523 from the laptop's base configuration. Origin also offers custom UV prints for the top of the laptop, a $30 upgrade that's nice to have if one of the 19 designs really catches your eye. You can also send in your own custom art to print, but that's a $140 charge. This level of customization isn't offered by a more conventional manufacturer like Dell, but I'd recommend going with a lighter print than a darker one. The Starfield print on the laptop I reviewed looked quite a bit murkier in person compared with the bright, beautiful image on Origin's site. The Eon17-X v2 is a beast in size and performance. Across the board, it delivered scores and frame rates on our benchmarks that were competitive with the highest-performing laptops we've tested, the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16, each of which features the same CPU/GPU duo in the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 4090. On Geekbench 6, the Eon17-X v2 put out single- and multicore scores that were in line with those of the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16. It had the fastest single-core score of the three, and its multicore score was 4% slower than the Alienware M18 R2's. It fell back a bit on our Cinebench 2024 tests, especially on the multicore CPU test, where it was 33% slower than the Alienware M18 R2. The Eon17-X v2 performed well on our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but it still trailed the Alienware and Razer. I checked to make sure thermal throttling wasn't to blame for the Origin's consistent third-place finishes of this trio since all three laptops share the same CPU and GPU configuration. When I repeated our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark back to back to back, the average temperature of the laptop's CPU and GPU was under 80 degrees Celsius the entire time, which I expected given how much fan noise the laptop puts out. That's a great reading, since you may start to experience performance drops as you inch closer to triple-digits. The Origin Eon17-X v2 is not the laptop to buy for your daily commute, both due to its weight (7.5 pounds) and the fact that you'll enrage everyone on your train or subway with its noise once you fire up a game. It's a great desk companion that feels incredibly sturdy and solid to use, and its 17.3-inch display is big enough to make your games feel immersive and fun. The huge footprint, including a near-1-inch thickness, provides plenty of room for both a regular keyboard and numpad. While they're centered on the laptop's palm rest, the laptop's gigantic touchpad (at 6 inches wide by just over 3.5 inches tall) is centered below the regular keyboard. This feels slightly awkward, as your left hand is a bit cramped for space when you rest it on the lower-left side of the laptop's palm rest, whereas your right has plenty of room. And this design puts your hands slightly off-center from the screen, which feels a little wonky. The keys themselves are incredibly comfortable to type on, with great travel (and resistance) for everything from casual gaming to first-person shooters. They light up, too, but you have to use Origin's Control Center app to manage your look; you can't adjust the colors using Function key shortcuts, including their brightness. It's a bit annoying to have to launch an app when you want to make modifications on the fly, and while the app lets you change the backlight color of any individual key or pick from one of nine preset effects that apply to all your keys at once, it's not as comprehensive as what you might get with most gaming keyboards. Parent company Corsair and its iCUE software allows for a lot more creativity, but that doesn't work on Origin's laptop. With Origin's Control Center, you can't, for example, create your own effects or patterns, set up reactive lighting for games, or import color profiles. The laptop's touchpad, though huge, is much more responsive toward its bottom than its top. You really have to push to register a click within an inch of the touchpad's top, which is annoying but not uncommon on a mechanical touchpad. I dislike that the laptop's arrow keys -- typically critical for gaming -- bleed right into its numpad. It's an awkward design to have the right arrow sit directly below the laptop's 1 key, and I question the usefulness of the numpad, in general, on a gaming laptop. I was slightly concerned that the laptop's vents, located on the upper half of its left and right sides, would cause some unpleasant hand-warming during game sessions. My fears were unfounded; the laptop's loud cooling system is nothing if not effective. Fan noise may be ever-present and thunderous, but I had no issues gaming on a couch. It's much more comfortable, however, to plop the heavy laptop on a desk than on your lap. Minor shortcomings aside, the Eon17-X v2 is built like a tank. Its downward-facing speakers, which sit on the laptop's bottom (closest to your lap), sound decent, with bass ever-so-slightly better than the meh quality most laptops dish out. They give you a pleasant, enveloping sound when you're checking out an errant TikTok or YouTube video, but there's absolutely no way you're going to use these for gaming. You're going to need to budget for a headset, possibly even noise-canceling, with this beast. The 17.3-inch display isn't an OLED, which is a letdown, given the laptop's price and noteworthy specs, but having a huge, gorgeous 4K display is nothing to be sad about. The display -- presumably IPS, though Origin doesn't detail this anywhere -- supports both the DCI-P3 and regular sRGB color spaces. Though folks who prefer color accuracy above all else might not care for the overly saturated look of DCI-P3, it makes games, movies and pictures absolutely pop. Unfortunately, the display doesn't support HDR, so you don't get those superrich scenes and dark-as-night black levels you might otherwise find on your living-room TV. The laptop's white levels hit 30 nits at its lowest brightness setting and an impressive 556 nits at its highest. You should have few, if any, issues seeing the screen in daylight, even if you're unlikely to commute with it because of its heft. The minimum luminance is right in the sweet spot: not too dim to look bad but not too bright to cause annoyance to those who are particularly sensitive when staring at screens all day long. The laptop's 4K resolution is a great fit for its humongous screen, making everything look sharp and crisp. I had as much fun (as one possibly can) mucking around in spreadsheets and Google Docs as I did gaming on the Eon17-X v2, and I would absolutely use this laptop as my daily driver -- just at my desk, not carried around my house. To that point, it's also great that the laptop, big as it is, comes with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity (supporting 160Hz-wide wireless channels for those of you living far away from any neighbors). I don't foresee moving it around very much, so it's great that you can hardwire yourself into blazing speeds on your home network, especially if you're rocking a higher-than-gigabit setup. The rest of the laptop's ports cover all the bases, from USB-A and USB-C to HDMI and DisplayPort -- no issues there. The most noteworthy inclusion among the ports are the two USB-C ports that offer the latest Thunderbolt 5 connectivity. My only qualm with the Eon17-X v2 is that it's very expensive for the performance it delivers. If you build Alienware's M18 R2 with the same specs as this Origin laptop, you're already saving around $250 (limited-time discounts notwithstanding) for a system that's a step faster for gaming by a not-so-insignificant amount (though it lacks a 4K screen). Match an Eon17-X v2 configuration to the M18 R2 that we reviewed, and it's the same deal: Origin's system costs around $250 more, but you get a much better, if slightly smaller, display. If all you care about are frame rates, Alienware's M18 R2 remains the gaming laptop to beat. But for an overall experience, especially when you can find it on sale, Origin's Eon17-X v2 wins out for its superior display and slightly better customizability when you're building the laptop to begin with. Resist the urge to configure more laptop than you really need, and it's worth the extra cost you'll pay for everyday use.

472,What's Next for iPhones? Apple Seems to Have Big Plans in 2025,"Apple might have more than just its typicaliPhonelaunches in store for next year. If the reports are true, 2025 could mark a few significant firsts for Apple's 16-year-old device. Apple may releaseits first ""slim"" iPhone model,put its own 5G modems inside the iPhone for the first time and we may see the firstiPhone SEwith Face ID. Plus, we'll likely get a much closer look at Apple's AI plans for the iPhone, since the current wave ofApple Intelligencefeatures feels like just the beginning. There's a lot riding on Apple's plans for the iPhone in 2025. At a time when consumers are holding onto their phones for longer periods of time, it's harder than ever to entice iPhone users to upgrade. According toa CNET surveyin partnership with YouGov, 44% of smartphone owners only buy a new phone when their current one needs replacing. But with rumored new models like the iPhone 17 Slim and a redesigned cheaper iPhone, Apple could have an easier time exciting potential shoppers. If it gets it right, that is. If Apple does release a significantly thinner iPhone, there's a chance that the extra-svelte design will come at a higher cost. And given the lukewarm reception Apple Intelligence has gotten so far, the pressure will be on Apple to impress consumers with new features next year. Read more:Apple Watch Settings You Should Change for a Smoother Experience The iPhone 16 lineup (pictured) includes the standard, Plus, Pro and Pro Max models. But next year, Apple is rumored to be releasing a new ""slim"" model instead of the Plus. WhileSamsung,Googleand otherAndroid phone makersoffer screens that fold in half, Apple is sticking with the same traditional bar shape the iPhone has had since its inception. But the company is reportedly considering shaking up the iPhone's design in a different way: by making it significantly thinner. Reports fromThe Information,Bloombergand TF International Securities analystMing-Chi Kuoindicate Apple may release a notably slimmer iPhone in 2025instead of an iPhone 17 Plus. The phone's sleek looks would be its main attraction; it would likely have similar specifications as the standard iPhone 17 otherwise but with a few compromises. For example, Kuo reports that this phone would have a single rear camera instead of the double camera found on theiPhone 16 and 16 Plus. It would also have the same processor as the base iPhone 17, according to the analyst. The iPhone 17 Slim, if well received, could be just what Apple needs to get consumers excited about its non-Pro iPhones. That's to say, perhaps a snazzy redesign will coerce consumers to upgrade because theywantto, not because theyneedto. Over the last two years, Apple's strategy has involved trickling features down from the Pro models, such as the Dynamic Island and the Action Button, to its standard iPhones to make them feel fresh and new compared to their predecessors. Read more:These 3 iPad Pro Features Should Come to the iPhone But with the iPhone 17 Slim, Apple would be introducing an entirely new style of iPhone for the first time since 2022, back when it launchedthe first Plus.Still, that phone didn't feel as novel and original as the iPhone 17 Slim likely will. Instead of just changing the size of the screen, it sounds like Apple is rethinking the iPhone's design in a way that would make it feel more portable and premium than a regular iPhone, a value proposition that's not too different from that of aflip phone-style foldable phone.Flip phones, for example, stand out for their unconventional looks and more compact designs. If Apple were to release a sleeker iPhone, it would presumably check both of those boxes, too. That said, there's a chance the iPhone 17 Slim will come with some tradeoffs, particularly around pricing since it could be more expensive than the Pro Max model, according toThe Information. The phone's extreme thinness could also raise durability concerns, although it's impossible to know until Apple releases the product -- if it does at all. The device is said to be 6-millimeters thin, according to analyst Jeff Pu asMacRumorsreported, which would make it notably sleeker than the 7.8mm iPhone 16. Otherwise, the iPhone 17 lineup will likely come with fresh processors from Apple and screens with higher refresh rates across all four models (only the Pros have this feature currently), according toETNews. All new iPhone models will also reportedly have a higher resolution 24-megapixel selfie camera, says analyst Jeff Pu perMacRumors. The next iPhone SE (not pictured) is rumored to look a lot like the iPhone 14. TheiPhone SEis expected to get a glow up. The fourth-generation of Apple's entry-level phone, which the company is expected to release in 2025, is said to have an edge-to-edge display like Apple's other iPhones, Face ID, the Action button, a 48-megapixel camera and Apple Intelligence, according to reports fromMacRumors,BloombergandKuo. That would represent a huge overhaul fromthe current model, released back in 2022, which looks like aniPhone 8with the same chip as theiPhone 13. Those changes alone could make the iPhone SE a compelling option for those looking to replace their current iPhone but don't need high-end specs like a smoother screen and additional camera. Android phones like theGoogle Pixel 8Ahave been leaving the iPhone SE in the dust in terms of design, screen size and camera capabilities, but it sounds like that could change with the next model. There's another reason why the iPhone SE 4 could be particularly special: It may provide a peek at Apple's first cellular modem. Apple is reportedly developing its own modem, which is the component that enables phones to connect to cellular networks, to reduce its reliance on long term partner and rivalQualcomm, according toBloomberg. The iPhone SE 4 will be the first Apple product with the modem when it launches next spring, the report says, before making its way to more premium devices. Apple's first modem is said to be less capable than Qualcomm's; it won't, for example, support millimeter wave 5G, says Bloomberg. But the initiative would give Apple more control over its product development cycle, which could eventually result in new capabilities and better performance the same way its M-series chips have for the Mac. Siri has a new look with Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence, the company's first major push into consumer-facing AI, officially arrived in October, providing a glimpse into Apple's vision for how AI can make our phones more useful. But the first wave of features doesn't bring radical changes to the iPhone and neither did the second phase, which arrived in December. Apple Intelligence, in its current form, primarily consists of assistive tools for tasks such as erasing objects from photos, rewriting text and getting tech help from Siri, along with the ability to create emojis and images based on a prompt. Siri also now hasChatGPT integration, and iPhone 16 owners can use the camera button to launchVisual Intelligence, which lets you learn about the world around you using the camera. But next year, Apple will start laying the groundwork for what could be a larger shift in how we use our phones -- primarilythanks to Siri.Apple's virtual helper will be able to incorporate personal context into responses, take action within apps and understand what's on your phone's screen to assist with answering questions. Read more:I'm Not Impressed With AI on Phones Yet. What It Will Take to Change My Mind Those changes could make Siri a far more capable virtual assistant and could perhaps set the stage for a broader shift towards the iPhone's software becoming more intelligent. Apple indeed has larger plans to revamp Siri with more sophisticated large language models (i.e. the same tech that fuels ChatGPT), according toBloomberg. This new Siri would be capable of answering questions more quickly and in a more natural manner, more similar toGoogle's Geminiand OpenAI's ChatGPT. But that overhaul isn't expected to arrive until 2026 even if Apple announces it next year, the report says. If accurate, this would mean Apple's true answer to OpenAI and Google's chatbot would come to the market much later than its competitors, putting more pressure on Apple's technology to be successful. But Apple sees this as a long-term play and would rather wait until it's perfected its own unique approach rather than rushing to catch up, which is its modus operandi. ""We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said toWired's Steven Levyin a recent interview when asked if he had considered charging for Apple Intelligence. Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold is one of several foldable Android phones that aims to blend the experience of a phone and a tablet. Rumblings of an iPhone that bends in half have circulated for years, but don't expect to see one anytime soon.Bloombergreports that a foldable iPad will likely come before afoldable iPhone, and both devices are likely still years away. Android phone makers have looked to foldable designs as a means to reinvigorate the smartphone market amid stalling sales and longer upgrade cycles. But even though the market for foldable phones is expected to grow by 10.5% in 2024 according to theInternational Data Corporation, growth is slowing as phonemakers -- particularly those in China, where foldables are particularly popular -- are shifting their focus to generative AI. Foldable phonescan be beneficial for the right type of consumer, but their high prices make them hard to justify for most. Traditional phones are so ingrained in our lives that it's going to take a convincing argument to coerce shoppers into trying something new. The fact that Apple hasn't released a foldable phone yet -- and doesn't seem to be in a rush to do so -- suggests it may have the same perspective. Until Apple publicly announces its new products, nothing is certain. But if the reports turn out to be true, 2025 will have much more in store than your average iPhone launch. Given that Apple has a reputation for showing consumers why new technologies are useful rather than being first, the expectations for new products like Apple Intelligence (and perhaps eventually a foldable iPhone) are particularly high.",Apple may have more than just the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro in store for next year.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/whats-next-for-iphones-apple-seems-to-have-big-plans-in-2025/,
473,Best VPN for Travel,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. Factors to consider in a VPN for travel Server network When selecting a VPN for travel, you'll want to consider the number of overall servers alongside the different countries. Look for at least 60 distinct countries, although 100 or more is even better. More specifically, make sure the VPN provider you sign up for has servers in the countries you frequently travel to and from. Internet speed loss All VPNs slow down your internet speeds somewhat because routing your traffic through an encrypted server. A 25% average internet download speed loss or less shouldn't be noticeable, even on slower connections. Privacy On the privacy front, look for critical features including a kill switch, DNS leak protection, no-logging policy and third-party audits. We also recommend picking a VPN provider that publishes regular transparency reports. Folks with essential privacy needs may consider a VPN company with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances. Device support Especially for travel, you'll want to make sure you can install a VPN on the devices you're bringing on your trip. Think about the platforms you use -- Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, browsers or routers -- and make sure your VPN supports those gadgets. Additionally, think about the number of simultaneous devices you'll need to use to make sure your VPN allows that many. Streaming capabilities You can use a VPN to watch streaming services from your home country while abroad -- like watching Peacock, Max or Hulu from outside of the US. Likewise, you can unblock foreign content libraries on services such as Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Make sure your VPN provider can access geo-restricted content from the apps you want to watch. Cost A VPN runs you anywhere from $5 to $15 per month, $40 to $100 per year or $80-plus for two or more years. Usually, you'll experience the greatest savings with a two-plus-year plan, but we recommend sticking to a one-year plan for the sweet spot of the most savings with the least risk when compared with a multi-year subscription. Privacy protection and transparency SCORE ExpressVPNis an outstanding all-around VPN. It’sexcellent for streaming, offers extremely user-friendly plus boasts forward-thinking privacy and transparency. Because of its 3,000-plus servers in 105 countries, ExpressVPN is a solid choice for travel -- its server roster jostles with other providers, including NordVPN, Proton VPN and Surfshark. We like the reliability of its apps, which are slick and intuitive to use, unlike some other VPN providers whose apps feel like they require a manual to operate. Our CNET Labs team clocked a 24.8% average internet download speed loss when using ExpressVPN. That’s slower than NordVPN (11%), Mullvad (13%), Surfshark (17%) and Proton VPN (21%), but still plenty for bandwidth-intensive applications like gaming or 4K video streaming. Express did a great job unblocking geo-restricted content, like foreignNetflixand Disney Plus libraries. ExpressVPN is the best VPN for travel for most folks, it’s also one of the most expensive options on the market. At $13 a month, $100 a year (then $117 a year upon renewal) or $140 total for the first two years (then $150 upon renewal), Express is considerably more expensive than the $48 for the first year or $56 total for the first two years thatSurfsharknormally charges (the one- and two-year plans jump to $60 per year upon renewal).Rival NordVPNis somewhere in between the cost of ExpressVPN and Surfshark at $13 a month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years (then $140 annually on the one- and two-year plans). For the money, we’d like to see more than eight simultaneous connections -- that’s two fewer than Nord and Proton and far less than the unlimited simultaneous device allowances from Surfshark and PIA. Still, ExpressVPN sports a generous global server network, works well for streaming, doesn’t sacrifice privacy and remains easy-to-use for VPN veterans or newcomers alike. Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPNis one of the most well-known VPNs on the market, partly thanks to its widespread marketing campaigns. Nord remains a popular virtual private network option because of its exceptionally fast connections, privacy-focused features and excellent geo-unblocking for streaming services. Its user-friendly design that doesn't compromise on settings makes it an outstanding choice for casual VPN newcomers and seasoned power users alike. NordVPN’s global server network comprises more than 6,800 servers spanning 113 countries, making it a good option for a VPN when traveling domestically or internationally. With that many servers, you’re likely to find something nearby, even while abroad. The country count is right on par with the international reach of competitors like Proton VPN, Surfshark and ExpressVPN, all of which also boast a global server count of at least 100 countries. In our 2024speed tests, NordVPN solidified itself as hands-down the fastest VPN. Using its NordLynx VPN protocol, we measured an average internet speed loss of just 3.2% with Windows and 12.6% on MacOS. On OpenVPN, we recorded an average internet download speed loss of 10.1% on MacOS and 18.8% on Windows. Whether you choose an OpenVPN connection or the NordLynx protocol, you’ll enjoy the smallest possible internet speed degradation. With apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS, browsers and even Apple TV, Nord runs on almost any platform you can think of. We appreciate NordVPN's commitment to privacy and security. In addition to features like Onion over VPN (Tor) and a Double VPN, which deliver additional encryption, a2023 audit by Deloittebacked up its no-log claims for improved transparency. Folks with serious privacy needs can even buy a Nord subscription withcryptocurrenciesfor pseudo-anonymity. While zero-logging policies are challenging to verify with absolute certainty, third-party audits provide peace of mind. On the entertainment side, we had no issues streaming US and UK Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus libraries on most devices -- another perk when traveling abroad. At $13 a month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years, NordVPN sets you back less initially than premium VPNrivals like ExpressVPN, but more than budget-oriented companies like Surfshark and PIA. Subsequent price hikes drive the price to $140 a year, which aligns with many other VPN providers, including Express. Overall, NordVPN sports advanced privacy features in an intuitive service with a slew of worldwide servers. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfsharkis a wallet-friendly VPN that doesn’t skimp on features, speed or servers. At $15 a month, $48 for the first year or $56 total for the first two years before a price hike to a still cost-effective $60 annual price for the one- and two-year plans, Surfshark is one of the cheapest VPNs available. Despite its modest price, you’ll enjoy a generous network with over 3,200 servers in 100 countries to find a reliable connection across the globe. Moreover, Surfshark provides unlimited simultaneous connections (ExpressVPN only gives you eight while NordVPN offers 10) making it a greatmultidevice VPN. Our lab tests found an impressive 17% average speed loss, which matches some of thefastest VPNson the market, like ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Thanks to its blisteringly fast connectivity, you can easily perform internet-demanding tasks like 4K streaming and competitivegaming. I could stream geo-protected content from Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Watching Star Trek: The Next Generation on Netflix -- usually a Paramount Plus exclusive -- was a real treat (although I’ve got aParamount Plus subscriptionand the complete series on DVD). Aside from its Windows, MacOS, Android and iPhone apps, Surfshark has a GUI Linux app, which means you can pack yourSteam Deckor Linux laptop. Surfshark’s robust privacy features make it a solid choice for working with sensitive data, such as circumventing geo-specificcensorshipwhile traveling. You’ll find a stringent no-logging policy, AES-256-bit encryption (on OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 with WireGuard and a kill switch. Aside from these basics, Surfshark features amenities including Dynamic Multihop and IP Rotator, making it even harder to uncover your IP address and further strengthening privacy. Its RAM-only servers and obfuscation further bolster Surfshark’s already strong data protection. Unfortunately, Surfshark’s jurisdiction falls under the 14 Eyes, so folks with tight security needs -- like journalists working with sensitive data -- might be disappointed. However, Surfshark published itsfirst transparency reportin August 2024, which serves as a key trust signal to privacy-minded folks. Surfshark punches well above its weight class, delivering outstanding value without sacrificing privacy and performance. Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE Private Internet Accessbrings a lot to the table, particularly for regular travelers. Its large server network blankets the globe with 35,000 servers in 91 countries. ExpressVPN and Surfshark deliver more individual country choices, but PIA’s sheer number of servers lets you easily find an optimal connection. It’s an especially great VPN for folks traveling domestically or to one of the worldwide locales where Private Internet Access maintains a decent presence. In our experience, we found PIA unblocked Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on both US and UK servers, making it a goodVPN for streaming. Its wallet-friendly pricing sets you back just $12 monthly, $40 annually or $79 total for three years. By comparison, most VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically charge $60 to 100 a year. While the value-packed Surfshark charges around $48 for your first year, its price jumps to $60 after its initial sweet introductory pricing, whereas PIA foregoes price hikes for attractively transparent pricing. Despite its relatively low cost, PIA doesn’t cut corners. Although it’s not the most feature-rich VPN, you’ll get a solid privacy suite, including akill switchthat stops your internet if your VPN gets disconnected,split tunnelingfor using a VPN for some apps but not others and 256-bit encryption over OpenVPN or IKEv2 with ChaCha20 on WireGuard. There’s multihop, which routes your connection through another server for additional privacy, and obfuscated servers, making it tougher for apps or ISPs to identify when you’re using a VPN. PIA also boasts unlimited simultaneous connections -- the pricier ExpressVPN limits you to eight. Unfortunately, PIA delivered middling internet speeds in our testing with an average speed loss of 49%. All VPNs slow down your connection somewhat, with thefastest VPNsoffering an average internet speed loss of 20% or less. For instance, NordVPN -- the quickest VPN we benchmarked -- provided a best-in-class 11% reduction, while Surfshark clocked a solid 17%. Folks with faster internet connections like fiber shouldn’t notice a difference even with a higher speed loss, but PIA isn’t ideal for people with slower speeds like satellite internet users. With its decent features, pricing transparency and subscriptions that significantly undercut the competition, PIA remains a solid VPN that boasts a generous server network, unlimited simultaneous connections and relative affordability compared to VPN rivals. The only free plan we recommend SCORE Proton VPNis an outstanding option for privacy-minded folks, with its open-source apps, Secure Core servers, Tor over VPN and full-disk encryption, which enhances security. The Swiss-based VPN company is an excellent option for use while traveling since its VPN adds best-in-class privacy, a benefit for situations like preventing your internet service provider from tracking your browsing history. Pricing is simply average at $10 monthly, $60 annually or $108 for two years (both the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 a year), but Proton’s unmatched privacy and transparency justify the cost. Note that we don’t recommend a two-year subscription despite attractively low prices because of the way VPNs change so quickly: Your initially fast, secure VPN provider might suffer slow servers or a data breach over a year. You’ll benefit from a solid 9,300-plus servers in 112 countries with its paid plans -- the most individual countries of any VPN we tested -- and Proton includes the only free tier we recommend, which lets you connect to servers in five countries (the US, Japan, Poland, Romania and the Netherlands). Its average 21% internet download speed loss is more than capable of handling 4K video streaming, Zoom calls, online gaming and other bandwidth-intensive tasks. Proton VPN is a solid pick for privacy-conscious travelers and features a terrific free VPN plan, with a premium tier that delivers an outstanding roster of international servers.  ExpressVPNis the best VPN for travel overall, with more than 3,000 servers in 105 countries. Some competitors include more simultaneous connection locations, but Express trounces its rivals with generous global options. NordVPNis the fastest VPN we tested and sports a slew of 6,800-plus servers peppering 113 different countries. Its minimal internet speed loss and extensive worldwide server network make it a great choice for travel, both domestically and internationally. Surfsharkis an excellent value VPN provider, with a terrific feature set and 3,200 servers in 100 countries. Private Internet Accessworks well for security-minded people on a budget, with its 35,000 servers peppered throughout 91 international spots. Protonis the best free VPN on the market, offering access to servers in five different countries. Additionally, its paid premium plan boasts an exhaustive network of 9,300-plus servers in 112 countries. Avirtual private networkmasks your IP address, which provides information about your physical location. VPNs fulfillvarious needs, including bolstering privacy, unblocking geographically protected content like foreign Netflix libraries and circumventing bandwidth throttling. That suite of features makes VPNs particularly useful when traveling. Whether you want to stream region-restricted movies and shows while traveling, log into your online banking app from abroad without triggering a CAPTCHA or add an extra layer of protection on public Wi-Fi (such as at the airport terminal and your hotel), a VPN is essential for travel. The benefits of VPNs make them great to install before you embark on your journey. Here at CNET, we’ve thoroughly assessed dozens of VPNs, running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, streaming videos and comparing prices to analyze value. When rounding up the top travel VPNs, we primarily focused on each provider’s server locations by number of countries and total options. We also considered privacy features, device compatibility and general performance. Whether you're heading home for the holidays, galavanting across the globe on business or taking a vacation abroad, a virtual private network is a great addition to your app arsenal. Let’s dive into the best VPNs for travel to keep you connected wherever you roam. There’s a lot to think about when selecting a VPN for travel. Leveraging our years of expertise in the VPN space coupled with what you’ll need when traveling, here’s what to look for: Server network Specifically for travel, you’ll want a large VPN server network. More overall connectivity options are beneficial, you’ll also want plenty of countries if you plan on any international travel. Therefore, it's important to consider the total number of servers as well as the individual country count. For instance, some VPNs have thousands of servers sprinkled through only a few nations. At the high end, you'll find VPNs with servers in 100 or more countries, although I'd recommend picking a VPN with a presence in at least 50 international locations. Many servers in a smaller handful of countries might work if you only travel to one of those spots. For regular international adventures, greater country choice comes in handy. Privacy VPNs add a layer of protection by encrypting your traffic and masking your IP address, making it harder for cyber attackers to access your browsing data. When traveling, you’ll likely use open wireless networks at an airport terminal, in the hotel lobby or at a coffee shop, but a VPN protects your data from eavesdropping, whether by cyber criminals or snooping ISPs. Look for a strict no-logging policy, and AES 256-bit encryption (OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 (WireGuard or IKEv2) at a minimum. Device compatibility You’ll want a VPN that runs on the gadgets you’re bringing on your trip. Make a list of the devices you want to bring along with a VPN installed and ensure your provider has apps for those electronics. Luckily, most providers offer solid Windows, MacOS, Android and iPhone apps. Many offer Linux VPN apps, but only a few feature a graphical user interface, which is more beginner-friendly than a command-line interface. If you want to tote your Linux laptop or a Steam Deck along, look for a VPN with a Linux GUI app. Although most folks don’t travel with streaming devices, you might tote along aFire Stick, Android TV box orApple TVfor your hotel room. Speed All VPNs throttle your internet upload and download speeds somewhat, but the fastest options drop your connectivity by an average loss of only 10% to 25%. Especially if you’re performing internet-intensive tasks like streaming video in 4K, Zooming for work, gaming or uploading YouTube videos, you’ll want a fast VPN. Even if you aren’t, reliable internet speeds are great for a better experience checking your email and browsing the web. Streaming support Aside from privacy, many people use VPNs to unblock region-restricted content. For instance, you can use a VPN to watch BBC iPlayer -- normally available only in the UK -- from other countries, like the US. Similarly, a VPN is useful when traveling. If you’re on holiday in a foreign country but want to access Netflix libraries from your home country to continue your binge-watching, a VPN makes that possible. Check which VPNs unblock the streaming services you want to watch from abroad. Price VPNs range from around $13 a month to about $100 annually. Generally, you’ll get a discount by paying for a year or more of service upfront, but we don’t recommend shelling out for more than 12 months at a time. While the VPN you pick might initially be fast, secure and excellent for streaming, it could get acquired by a shady company, suffer a data breach or get slower during a year. We suggest sticking to an annual plan for the best value and the least risk. A VPN makes a great travel companion thanks to its privacy features and geographic unblocking. Since a VPN encrypts your internet traffic, it protects your data to a degree from others on a public Wi-Fi network seeking unencrypted data. Websites you visit don’t see your actual IP address and instead view an IP given to you by your VPN software, making it harder to view personal information such as your physical location or online activity. You’re still susceptible to malware, viruses and phishing attacks, so keep in mind that a VPN isn’t anantivirus software replacement. You can findantivirus software bundled with some VPNsand vice versa. VPNs can also spoof apps and internet-connected services like websites into thinking you’re located in a different region. For example, you might be on holiday in the UK but want to access your Gmail without triggering a security login. Or perhaps you’d like to stream a movie that is only available on US Netflix while in Canada. Using a VPN, you can make it appear like you’re in a different city or even country. Whether for entertainment purposes or bypassing CAPTCHAs, VPNs can circumvent location restrictions. For more geographically specific VPN information, check out our guides to thebest VPNs for Canada,MexicoandJapan. I couldn’t use this article as an excuse to travel extensively, but I have country-hopped regularly, with notable stints in the UK, Peru and Sierra Leone. On a trip to Rome in 2019, I downloaded a VPN on my laptop and Android phone before leaving so I could stream Netflix from the hotel and access my Gmail without triggering a security alert (at the time, I was using VPN Unlimited, although I’ve since switched to ExpressVPN). To select the best VPNs for travel, we rigorously assessed dozens of providers by running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, poring over terms of service, using apps and streaming videos. We researched VPN provider server networks, factoring in the overall number and country locations, which dictate whether a virtual private network is suitable for globe-trotting. IPVanishoffers 2,400-plus servers in 55 countries, a smaller international selection than many competitors; NordVPN, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark tout 100 or more country locations, while PIA offers over 90 countries. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) In our experience, IPVanish's internet download speeds were uneven with a 44% average internet download speed loss in our 2024 testing, with fast speeds marred by occasionally noticeable dips, which could impact gaming or 4Kstreaming. IPVanish provides plenty of perks, including unlimited simultaneous connections, reasonably fast internet download speeds and user-friendly apps. It streams and unblocks region-restricted content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus with aplomb. At $13 monthly, $40 for the first year or $53 total for two years (both the 12- and 24-month plans jump to $90 per year after the sweet introductory pricing), IPVanish saves you money upfront compared to companies like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. IPVanish works fine for casual use, but you can get a VPN with a much larger server network, more robust privacy features and faster internet speeds, all of which benefit travel. IPVanish’s user-friendly apps make it a decent choice for beginners seeking a VPN to add peace of mind and allow for streaming abroad. Wallet-friendly VPNs PIA and Surfshark are better options for the money because of their larger server networks. Read our IPVanish review With 11,500-plus servers spanning 100 countries,CyberGhostoffers loads of choices for international travel. It’s decent for streaming from Netflix, BBC iPlayer and other sites. You can use specific servers optimized for streaming, but streaming works on all servers. CyberGhost remains wallet-friendly at $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 total for the first two years of service (you’re billed annually after 24 months of service on its two-year plan). CyberGhost lacks advanced privacy features like Tor over VPN or double-hop servers, both of which make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to its source. There isobfuscation, which makes it more difficult to determine that you’re using a VPN, which can circumvent restrictions by countries, ISPs or Wi-Fi networks that have blocked VPNs. Obfuscated servers could be useful when running a VPN at school, work or in a country where virtual private networks are frowned upon. CyberGhost's high internet speed loss isn’t ideal for demanding applications like 4K streaming or gaming. CyberGhost does provide some useful features, including akill switch, which shuts off your internet if your VPN gets disconnected andsplit tunnelingfor selectively choosing some apps, but not all to route through your VPN. All things considered, CyberGhost is acceptable for casual use like streaming videos or web browsing, and its exhaustive server network is particularly well-suited to travel. Uneven speed loss and middle-of-the-road privacy features mean you’ve likely got better choices. Read our CyberGhost review. Sporting over 3,200 servers in 80-plus countries,Hotspot Shieldworks well enough for globe-trotting. We like its reasonable 26% average speed loss and excellent streaming support. Still, the lackluster pricing of $10 per month or $96 annually runs you more than faster, more secure VPNs such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark. Because Hotspot Shield is based in the US -- part of theFive Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance-- it’s not great for privacy-concerned users. Its closed-source Hydra Catapult VPN protocol and unnecessary data collection give us pause in recommending it over other options, particularly when you can spend less money to get a faster VPN with better privacy. Read our Hotspot Shield Review. ExpressVPN is the best VPN for travel overall, with its extensive network of 3,000-plus servers in 105 countries. A diverse server selection makes ExpressVPN the best VPN to use internationally as well as when roaming domestically. Yes, you can use a VPN while traveling. VPNs have multiple uses, but they’re great for bolstering online privacy while using unsecured Wi-Fi networks and unblocking geo-restricted content, such as streaming your home country’s Netflix library from abroad. The VPN that’s best for changing countries depends on which country you need to connect to since providers offer different country servers. In general, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN, NordVPN and Surfshark are excellent choices, each boasting more than 100 countries to pick from. The more individual country choices you’ve got, the better a VPN is for switching locales. Using a VPN while traveling delivers several benefits, including additional privacy, unblocking geographically restricted content and avoiding censorship of social media or news websites in certain countries. Yes, it's worth getting a VPN for travel. A virtual private network set to a server in the country you're physically located in lets you enjoy an encrypted connection while on public Wi-Fi. By using a VPN server from your home country while traveling abroad, you can avoid CAPTCHAs and access streaming service libraries from your country of origin.",Enjoy extra privacy and circumvent geographical restrictions while roaming internationally or domestically with CNET's favorite VPNs for travel.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-travel/,
474,"YouTube TV vs. Hulu Plus Live TV: With Price Hikes, Which One Is Right for You?","Don't look now, but the seemingly constant price increases for streaming have hit two of our favorites: Disney'sHulu Plus Live TVand Google'sYouTube TV. Both theselive TV streaming servicesubscriptions were expensive already because they're designed toreplace cable TV. Each one offers a large selection of live channels, such as CNN, ESPN and TNT, as well as local stations ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and more, without requiring a cable box or a contract. The bad news? They're not getting any cheaper. In October, Hulu With Live TVwent up to $83 per monthfor the least-expensive plan. And a few days ago,YouTube TV followed suit, announcing its own price increase to $83, which will go into effect in January 2025. These types of price hikes have happened routinely over the years, but even so, streaming is usually less expensive overall than cable. Both Hulu and YTTV offer features like an advanced DVR with program guide and extensive on-demand content. And unlike cable they're easy to watch on phones and mobile devices as well as on TVs viamedia streamers(includingRoku,Amazon Fire TVorApple TV), yourgame consoleor yoursmart TVitself. That's why we recommend most folks at least strongly considercutting the cable TV cord. So which one should you choose? Both have their pluses and minuses, but ultimately each offers a great live TV streaming experience. In general, it's a choice between having the biggest streaming bundle for the least amount of money, or being able to watch the greatest number of top channels.Huluhas an excellent selection of channels and adds a gigantic catalog of on-demand shows and movies. On top of that, it also includes the Disney Bundle -- Disney Plus and ESPN Plus and isour current Editors' Choice. Of all the services,YouTube TVstill offers the most of the top 100 channels, though it currently has a lead of only three channels. Want a little bit more information? Here's how they stack up. Note that the article below reflects YouTube TV's current price, not the January 2025 price hike. Hulu's greatest assets are the integration of a full complement of live TV channels with a massive catalog of on-demand content, and all for the one price. Hulu's channel count is solid, including some must-have programming. Its $83 per month price includes the ad-supported versions of Disney Plus and ESPN Plus, and there are even higher-priced choices for people who don't want to watch ads. If you want the most bang for buck, Hulu Plus Live TV is where the smart money is. With an excellent channel selection, easy-to-use interface and excellent cloud DVR, YouTube TV is an excellent cable TV replacement. If you don't mind paying a bit more than the Sling TVs of the world, YouTube TV offers a great live TV streaming experience.  Read more:Best Free TV Streaming Services: Roku Channel, Pluto TV, Tubi TV, Sling TV and More The biggest difference comes down to channels. Comparing the total channel counts fromour big list of the top 100 channels on every service, YouTube TV comes out on top with 78 from that list, closely followed by Hulu with 75. That total doesn't include every channel the services carry, just the ones in the top 100 as determined by the editors at CNET, but it still provides a good indication. The two share most major national channels including Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ESPN, Fox News, NFL, TBS, USA Network, PBS and more, but there are a few differences. Here's a condensed version of that list showing the 12 of those 100 channels carried by one and not the other.  Both services offer all four of the major local channels -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- in most areas of the country, and both also carry local affiliates from The CW and MyTV. Both services also carry a number of local PBS stations. Neither service offers many regional sports networks after bothYouTube TVandHuludropped them in 2020. Beyond RSNs, however, YouTube TV has an advantage in national sports networks, with NBA TV available as part of its base package. YouTube users can pay another $11 to get the ""Sports Plus"" add-on that also includesFoxSoccer Plus, NFL RedZone and Tennis Channel. In addition, users also have exclusive access to theNFL Sunday Ticketfor an added $449. Meanwhile, Hulu users can sign up for a $10 package which includes NFL RedZone, Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel, MAVTV Motorsports Network, FanDuel Racing and FanDuel TV. Premium channels like HBO, Starz and Showtime are also available for extra fees, and Hulu has two optional channel packages. One is anadd-on for $8 per monthwith 16 channels including MTV Classic, CNBC World, the Cooking Channel and Science, and the other is a Spanish-language package withnine channels for $5. YouTube TV doesn't have any other additional channel packages, although you can add individual channels like Shudder and CuriosityStream for additional fees.

The menus and interfaces on both are quite different from one another and from regular cable, and we like YouTube TV's menus better overall. YouTube TV:In general the YouTube TV interface is easier to use, and not just for people used to using regular YouTube. If you're using the desktop or app versions, Google's streamer offers a streamlined structure -- even if it's not as pretty as Hulu. Hulu Plus Live TV:If it was all a matter of which interface is more fun, then Hulu would take it. Hulu's look is brighter, and though it lacks YouTube's comprehensive search, it's still relatively easy to drill down into the kind of content you want to watch. The difference in thenumber of simultaneous streamsis worth noting, especially for families and other households who watch a lot of TV. YouTube TV lets you stream to three different devices -- say, the living room TV, a bedroom TV and a tablet -- at the same time, while Hulu lets you stream to two. Pay Hulu a hefty $10 extra per month and it will upgrade your number of streams to unlimited. On the other hand, the only real reason to pay for the $20 4K upgrade on YouTube is to also get unlimited streams. YouTube TV has rightly earned accolades for its excellentcloud DVRbut Hulu closed the gap with anupgrade in 2022. Both now have unlimited storage and let you fast-forward through commercials in recorded content, so while we still consider YouTube TV's DVR the gold standard, Hulu's is very good too.

475,"Amid Safety Lawsuits, Character.Ai Updates Teen Protection Features","AI companyCharacter.Aiis updating its new teen safety guidelines and features, the company announced on Thursday. There will now be a separate model that fuels teens' experience messaging with its chatbots, with ""more conservative limits on responses"" around romantic and sexual content. If you've heard of the AI company before, it's probably because of arecent federal lawsuitfiled by Florida mom Megan Garcia alleging Character.Ai is responsible for her 14-year-old son's suicide. Character.Ai is an online platform that lets its users create and talk with different AI chatbots. There are chatbots that are meant to act as tutors, trip planners and therapists. Others mimic pop culture characters like superheroes and characters from Game of Thrones or Grey's Anatomy. The new safety measures are widespread ""across nearly every aspect of our platform,"" the companysaid in a statement. Character.Ai is also introducing parental controls, screen time notifications and stronger disclaimers reminding users chatbots aren't real humans and, in the case of chatbots posing as therapists, not professionals equipped to provide advice. The company said that ""in certain cases"" when it detects users referencing self harm, it will direct them to theNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Parental controls will be available sometime next year, and it appears as though the new disclaimers are beginning to roll out now. It is worth noting, though, that while users do have to submit a birthdate while signing up, Character.Ai does not require any additional age verification. The orange disclaimer at the top reads: ""This is not a real person or licensed professional. Nothing said here is a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis or treatment."" Garcia's lawsuit isn't the only one raising these concerns over child and teen safety on the platform. On Monday, Dec. 9, two Texas families filed a similar lawsuit to against Character.Ai and Google, one of the AI platform'searlier investors, alleging negligence and deceptive trade practices that makes Character.Ai ""a defective and deadly product."" Many online platforms and services have been beefing up their child and teen protections.

477,OpenAI Kicks Off a New Era With Sora AI Videos,"It's the beginning of a new era for AI company OpenAI. ChatGPT users can now create AI-generated videos, thanks to this week's roll-out ofSora, OpenAI's video model. The company has been developing a new version of the model, called Sora Turbo, for months and is now bringing the product out of research preview and making it available to the public. Sora is available starting now in the US but not yet in Europe or the UK. With Sora, ChatGPT users can create video clips entirely with generative AI. You can start by entering the usual text prompt, but you can also upload images and videos to guide the model. Sora Turbo is ""significantly"" faster and comes with several new upgrades, according to CEO Sam Altman who announced the news on Monday's 12 Days of OpenAI livestream. There's a lot to unpack in Sora AI. Let's dive in. This crime-fighting floof was generated using Sora AI. As with most AI image and video tools, you can enter a text prompt and the program will create short clips based on the ideas you described. With Sora, you can also upload photos and other videos to your prompts as reference material. You can also easily select the video's aspect ratio, resolution and duration, as well as how many variations you want the program to generate. The results are anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds long with resolutions between 480 and 1080p. There are also other postgeneration editing features like storyboard, remix and loop for more fine-tuning. If your account is public, all your text-based videos are eligible to be shared on Sora's community Explore page. You can change this by toggling offPublish to explorein your Sora profile settings. AnOpenAI help pagesays you can turn off model training in the same place, but CNET couldn't confirm it was active yet. Similar to OpenAI's image generatorDall-E 3, you'll need to have a paid plan to access Sora. ChatGPT Plus users (on the $20 per month plan) get 1,000 credits a month, 50 fast/priority generations and are limited to videos of 5 seconds at a max of 720p. ChatGPT Pro, thenewest, priciest tier availablefor power users for $200 per month, eases up on those limits. Pro users get unlimited relaxed generations, longer durations and higher resolution options -- and, notably, the ability to download videos without the company's watermark. OpenAI said it will bemore conservativein how it moderates content at Sora's launch -- that means it might be a little stricter with what prompts it allows you to generate or deny. In the livestream, OpenAI confirmed that you won't be able to generate videos of celebrities, politicians and other well-known public figures by name. You can check out the company's fullterms of usefor more information.",The AI videos are anywhere from five-to-twenty seconds long and include a visible watermark.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/openai-kicks-off-a-new-era-with-sora-ai-videos/,
478,Everything You Need to Know About Apple AirTags,"The holiday season meanstravelfor lots of folks, and travel means keeping track of all sorts of things -- luggage, keys, sunglasses,camera bagsand more. The best way to do that and not lose your mind is by including Apple AirTags into whatever you need to bring. The tiny Bluetooth trackers are essential items all year round, but during this time they prove their worth. (And they're also greatstocking stuffers.) I already use Apple's Find My service to keep tabs on devices, such as the iPad I frequently leave in my living room, as well as where family members are via their iPhones. But what if I want to pinpoint my keys? Or figure outwhether my luggage arrived on the same flightas I did? For that, I've come to rely on several Apple AirTags that fit into or onto almost anything I want to track. Apple's tracker depends on the crowdsourced Find My network to help you pinpoint your items, from keys you've misplaced at home to a bag you may have left in the office. Here's all you want to know about AirTags. For more, learn aboutwhy you shouldn't put an AirTag on a petand discoverfive unexpected places to stash an AirTag. An AirTag is an individual tracking device that securely broadcasts its location using Bluetooth wireless networking. It's a small glossy white puck not much larger than a US quarter and about the height of three stacked coins. A CR2032 coin cell battery keeps the AirTag powered for roughly a year. AirTags, back and front. Once the AirTag is paired with an iPhone or iPad, you can essentially forget about it. Hang it on a keychain or drop it into a bag —anything you want to be able to track or find later. A single AirTag retails for $29direct from Apple, and can be bought for around $24 from most outlets that sell electronics. However, it's always more economical to buy AirTags in packs of four — once you find a use for a solitary AirTag you'll soon think of other things you want to track. Apple sells the set for $99 and some retailers, such asAmazon,Best BuyandWalmart, have them for around $75, bringing the per-item cost down below $20. AirTags are also frequently reduced for big sales such as Black Friday and Prime Day. If you do order from Apple, you can engrave initials, numbers and emoji for free, which can help you tell the AirTags apart (or just add a personal spin). You can personalize AirTags with laser engraving if you order them direct from Apple. In typical Apple fashion, activating a new AirTag is easy. Initially, a plastic tab slipped in between the electronics and battery keeps the AirTag inert. Once you pull that tab and the pieces make contact, the AirTag starts broadcasting its presence. When you bring it close to an iPhone or iPad, a dialog box appears, giving you the option to connect the AirTag. An iPhone senses when a new AirTag is nearby and begins the connection process. When you tapConnect, choose a description of what the tag will be associated with, such as ""Handbag"" or ""Luggage""; you can also enter a custom name. Choose an emoji to represent the AirTag in the Find My app and tapContinue. The AirTag is linked to your Apple ID. In the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad or Mac, tap theItemsbutton to view the AirTags you've activated. On an Apple Watch, open theFind Itemsapp. Tap the item you want to locate. If you think it's close by, the easy option is to tap thePlay Soundbutton, which makes the AirTag emit a high-pitched trill. However, if you have an iPhone 11 or later (not counting the iPhone SE), tappingFinduses the iPhone's Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to locate the AirTag with more precision -- not just estimating the distance, such as ""1.5 ft nearby,"" but also point you in the right direction as you move around. If the item is not in your general vicinity, theFindbutton becomes aDirectionsbutton that will hand off the location to the Maps app for driving, walking, transit or cycling routes. To locate a nearby item, tap its AirTag (left), tap the Find button (middle) and then let the iPhone guide you to it (right). Being able to find something I've lost is invaluable, but it would be better if I didn't forget it in the first place. For every AirTag, you can enableNotify When Left Behind, an option that sends a notification if you and an AirTag that was with you are no longer together. That could be as simple as forgetting a bag at a restaurant or — more alarming — if someone swiped the item and is making a getaway. You know how in many thrillers and spy movies someone plants a tracker on a person and is then able to pinpoint the target's location no matter where they are? That always seemed far-fetched to me — what sort of range would a tiny piece of electronics have, really? — but an AirTag is essentially that. The AirTag also does not have that sort of range, but it has something better: millions of devices carried by Apple customers surrounding it. On a regular interval, the AirTag sends out a low-power Bluetooth signal containing an encrypted ID. Any nearby iPhone, iPad or Mac picks up the signal, adds its location coordinates (if it knows them) and sends that to Apple servers in a secure background transmission. When an AirTag is in proximity of an iPhone or other Apple device, it securely relays its ID to mark its location. That's how, when my luggage chose to spend an extra day in Europe without me, I knew it was still in the airport in France. Likely an iPhone owned by a traveler or employee picked up the ID of the AirTag in my bag and relayed that to Apple. When I opened the Find My app on my iPhone in Seattle, it queried the servers and presented the AirTag's last known location. All of this happens in the background — no personal information is sent, and the impact to the relaying device's performance and battery is negligible. Just as you can use an AirTag to track your personal objects, it is possible that someone could drop an AirTag into your bag or coat pocket to try to track your movements. Apple has put a few safeguards in place to try to prevent that type of situation. If your iPhone or iPad detects an unknown AirTag in your vicinity that is persistently near you, a notification appears that says ""AirTag Found Moving With You."" When you ransack your belongings and find it, open the Find My app on your iPhone or iPad, tapItemsand then tapIdentify Found Item. Place the AirTag against the back of the device at the top until you see a notification. When you tap that, you're taken to a web page with the tag's serial number and, optionally, contact information. If it turns out a family member's AirTag fell out of a bag, no worries. If it's one that's unfamiliar, you can follow instructions for how to disable the tag. For more, see how toprotect yourself from being tracked. You've looked everywhere, used theFindfeature to scan for it, but your item containing an AirTag is nowhere to be found. Now what? In the AirTag's details in the Find My app, scroll down toLost AirTagand tapShow Contact Info. If someone finds the tag and checks it as described just above, you can have a phone number or email displayed, plus an optional message, when they look up its information. The other option is to chooseShare Item Location, which creates a link you can send to someone identifying where the tag is. The link is active for just one week, which is hopefully more than enough time to let someone track it down. For example, suppose your bag is swiped: You could give the shared link to the police so they can track it down. (For safety reasons, don't confront someone who's stolen your property.) Share an AirTag's location temporarily with someone using a link. When the item and its AirTag are returned, a notification appears that you've been reunited. Or, you can make the tag's whereabouts hidden at any point by tappingStop Sharing Item Locationin the same screen, which invalidates the shared link. An AirTag is linked to your Apple Account, but for years that presented a problem: AirTags assigned to other people in my household would trigger the ""AirTag Found Moving With You"" warning -- not great on family trips when we'd take my wife's car. Now, fortunately, it's possible to share an AirTag's location with up to five people. Tap a tag in the Find My app and underShare AirTagtapAdd Person. TapContinueon the screen explaining what will happen, then select a contact and tapShare. Share an AirTag with a trusted friend so you can both view its location. In that person's Find My app, they can accept the shared item. Note that all people you add can track the location. In my experience, the CR2032 coin battery in each AirTag lasts about a year. When the level dips below about 10% remaining, you're alerted that the battery is low and a red indicator appears in the Find My app. When the battery in an AirTag gets low, an indicator appears in the Find My app. To replace the battery, turn the silver back counter-clockwise to release its latches. Lift the existing battery out and replace it with a new one, making sure the battery's identifying markings are facing you. Then align the tabs of the metal portion with the slots in the plastic piece, press lightly and turn clockwise. The AirTag will chirp when the electronics and battery are securely in contact. The battery in an AirTag is easily accessible and simple to replace. AirTags are not directly compatible with Android phones -- there's no app that ties into Apple's Find My network. To get the same tracking functionality, look into theChipolo One Pointtracker that uses Google's Find My Device network. Apple once offered an Android app called Tracker Detect that would let you identify a found AirTag, but that's not available for newer Android devices -- an app with that name in the Google Play store is from a separate developer. However, for phones with NFC chips installed, you can place a found AirTag against the back of the device to view information about it.

484,7 Quick Fixes to Boost Your Android Phone's Performance,"If you're running an older Android phone, it's natural to wonder if you should go ahead and upgrade or if your device has some life left in it. It's true you might be left out in the cold when it comes to the most recent version of Android, but that doesn't mean your phone can't still shine with the processing power it does have. It's all in the important tweaks you can make to yourAndroid phoneright now. So don't whip out your wallet just yet – and don't despair. You might be able to beef up your phone's performance in the blink of an eye with some super simple tips and tricks. It's true: whether you have aSamsung Galaxy,MotorolaorOnePlusphone, it's likely that you can stilloptimize your battery lifeand give your phone a new lease on life by making a few easy adjustments. Note that there might be some differences between Android devices, and phone manufacturers often put their own software on top of Android: certain settings may be missing or in a different place, depending on the version of Android you're running and the maker of your phone. Need more Android tips? Check out thesefive tips to make your Android feel like new againandhow to use Android's AI circle to search feature. An overly bright display will drain your battery incredibly fast. Living with a phone that has poor battery life can be infuriating, but there are some steps you can take to maximize each charge right from the very beginning: The brighter your screen, the more battery power it uses. To get to the setting, pull down the shortcut menu from the top of the screen and adjust the slider, if it's there. Some phones may have a toggle for auto brightness in the shortcut panel; otherwise, you need to open the settings app and search for ""brightness"" to find the setting and turn it off. These features focus on learning how you use your phone, including which apps you use and when, and then optimizing the apps and the amount of battery they use. Some Android phones will have a dedicated Battery section in the Settings app, while other phones (looking at you, Samsung) bury these settings. It's a little different for each phone. I recommend opening your settings and searching for ""battery"" to find the right screen. Your phone may also have an adaptive charging setting that can monitor how quickly your phone battery charges overnight to preserve its health. Another way to improve battery life while also helping save your eyes is to use Android's dedicated dark mode. Any Android phone running Android 10 or newer will have a dedicated dark mode option. According toGoogle, dark modenot onlyreduces the strain that smartphone displays cause on our eyesbut also improves battery life because it takes less power to display dark backgrounds on OLED displays (used in mostflagship phones) than a white background. Depending on which version of Android your phone is running, and what company made your phone, you may have to dig around the settings app to find a dark mode. If your phone runs Android 10 or newer, you'll be able to turn on systemwide dark mode. If it runs Android 9, don't despair. Plenty of appshave their own dark mode option in the settingsthat you can use whether or not you have Android 10. To turn it on dark mode, open theSettingsapp and search forDark Mode,Dark Themeor evenNight Mode(as Samsung likes to call it). I suggest using dark mode all the time, but if you're not sure, you can always set dark mode to automatically turn on based on a schedule, say from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, or allow it to automatically switch based on your location at the time of sunset and sunrise. Using dark mode on any phone is an easy and good-looking way to save battery. Planning to hit up the Google Play Store for abunch of new Android apps? Be prepared for a lot of icon clutter on your home screen, which is where shortcuts land every time you install something. If you don't want that, there's a simple way out of this: Long-press on an empty area of your home screen and tap Settings. Find the option labeled something along the lines ofAdd icon to Home ScreenorAdd new apps to Home Screenand turn it off. Presto! No more icons on the home screen when you install new apps. You can still add shortcuts by dragging an app's icon out of the app drawer, but they won't appear on your home screen unless you want them to. Read more:Best Android Phones You Can Buy in 2024 If your phone routinely spends the night on your nightstand, you probably don't want it beeping or buzzing every time there's a call, message or Facebook alert -- especially when you're trying to sleep. Android offers a Do Not Disturb mode that will keep the phone more or less silent during designated hours. On some phones, this is referred to as the Downtime setting or even Quiet Time. Head toSettings>Sounds(orNotifications), then look forDo Not Disturbor a similar name. If you can't find it, search for it using the built-in search feature in your settings. Using the feature, you can set up a range of hours when you want to turn off the digital noise. But don't worry, any notifications you get while Do Not Disturb is turned on will still be waiting for you when you wake up. Also, you can typically make an exception that allows repeat callers and favorite contacts' calls to go through. Turn that on.

485,"After Netflix's Black Doves, You Should Absolutely Watch This Stylish Thriller on Peacock","You've finished watching Black Doves and are contemplating that ending, wondering what will become of Sam, Helen -- and the nanny -- in season 2.

But probably not. While Black Doves has spy hijinks, double lives and hand-to-hand combat sequences and a mystery at its core, it's not a 100% assassin's tale. For that, I urge you to watch the clever, suspense-filled Peacock series,The Day of the Jackal. There are moments that are teeth-clenching. I don't know if you've seen Eddie Redmayne play a killer before, but his Jackal -- who goes by Charlie and many other names -- has swagger, excellent marksmanship and extreme work-life balance issues like Keira Knightley's Helen in Black Doves. However, these shows are not the same. The Jackal is a hitman-for-hire who's been making millions from his illegal profession, taking advantage of technology and sophisticated prosthetics to do his job. Based on the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth, the 10-episode series pulls some bits from the 1973 film adaptation but builds out the narrative to give the protagonist an origin story and affluent life with his unaware wife and baby. He speaks multiple languages, can blend in and is willing to hole up for three days and pee in water bottle to fulfill his end of a deal. That's dedication. While he exhibits a certain amount of aloofness, the Jackal isn't completely unflinching or unfeeling. At home, he's Charlie, a loving husband, father and in-law. Season 1 isn't just about following him on missions. The show also stars Lashana Lynch as Bianca Pullman, an MI-6 agent on his tail after he assassinates a politician. As you watch, you learn that she is smart as an agent but creates messes on the job and at home, some of which cannot be fixed. Bianca's obsession with capturing the Jackal comes with a high price. In the midst of her kicking off her investigation, our assassin is chasing after someone who chooses not to pay a debt and simultaneously lands a high-paying gig that comes with a hard deadline and conditions. If he succeeds, he can leave this profession, but if he fails, he'll have to run from MI-6andthe people who hired him. To make matters more complicated, his wife, Nuria (played by Money Heist star Úrsula Corberó) grows suspicious about him and starts digging. While the Jackal is very meticulous and maps out almost every move, he can't always account for last-minute logistical changes, law enforcement sweeps and checkpoints or nosey family members. There seemingly aren't enough passports in the world to help him recover from a sloppy escape. And at one point in the show, he cracks emotionally. Have you ever seen a contract killer cry? With British intelligence inching closer to discovering his true identity and whereabouts, there are tense scenes where the Jackal comes dangerously close to being found, caught or killed. He has a little bit of help, but that doesn't always pan out the way you expect it to. The season finale made me gasp. Stream all 10 episodes of season 1 of The Day of the Jackal, and patiently wait -- like him -- for season 2 to come to Peacock.",You'll feel the tension in your bones with this one.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/after-netflixs-black-doves-you-should-absolutely-watch-this-stylish-thriller-on-peacock/,
486,How to Get Free Audiobooks With Just a Library Card and an App,"Sometimes, friends and family don't understand why I don't mind long drives, whether it's a long-haul holiday visit or a quick jaunt to return something someone forgot at my place. The secret is the trip, whatever the length, is the perfect time to get lost in one of my favorite pastimes:audiobooks. And with just a simple library card, one special app has given me access to more of them than I'll ever need, and can do the same for you. Audiobooks are an addiction I picked up straight out of college, with a newfound need to occupy my brain during commutes to work and lunch breaks. I was pushed to give them a try after being mightily embarrassed over my inability to make much progress into Lord of the Rings throughout my entire undergraduate education. With just a few months ofan Audible membership, I had worked my way through that fantasy bible and was off onto new literary horizons. Audiobooks aren't for everybody -- some people have told me they find it difficult to retain what they hear -- but if audiobooks are for you, you need to check out an app called Libby. Thanksgiving might be over, but with the broaderholiday travel seasonon the horizon, it just might be the perfect companion for long drives or flights. Or for distracting yourself once you're with the family; we're not here to judge. For more about holiday travel, dig intoour stress-free travel checklistand find outwhich essential items to keep track of while packing. Previously known as OverDrive, the Libby app lets you access digital publications from real library systems. While I might be here to evangelize about its audiobook offerings, you can also borrow ebooks, digital comic books and digital magazines. All of that content won't cost you a dime, but while there might be such a thing as a free lunch, there probably isn't such a thing as a no-effort lunch. All that to say, Libby requires a real library card to access anything, and while some systems will let you sign up for a card online, in most places, you will eventually have to go to your local library in person to get set up with a card, and you'll need to make sure it stays up to date. A small price to pay, if you ask me, for a nearly unlimited supply of free books. Read more:Best E-Reader of 2024 Libby is available through Apple'sApp Store, theGoogle Play storeand theAmazon Appstore. If you've got a phone, tablet or laptop in your pocket or bag, you can get Libby. You can also access the service via a web browser atlibbyapp.com. Once you've created a Libby account and entered your library card's info, all you have to do is search for the title you want and borrow it. If you've ever used Spotify or the Apple Music app, or other audiobook apps like Audible or Apple Books, you'll know what to expect with the Libby player. Elsewhere, you can read ebooks in Libby or by exporting them to your Kindle app. One of the major value propositions that Libby offers is the ability to add multiple library cards. Some library systems out there will allow you to sign up for a card even if you don't live in its local area. For example, as a resident of New York state, I'm able to access the New York City Public Library in Manhattan, the Queens Public Library and the Brooklyn Public Library, as well as my local library, dramatically expanding the catalog I can pull from. Go digging on Google and see if any library systems in your state offer something similar. As Libby is connecting you with real libraries, you're required to work within the limitations of library rentals. That means that each title will have a limited number of ""copies"" that the library can lend at a time, so if the one you're looking for is all booked up, you'll have to place a hold and wait for it to become available. Once you borrow something, you'll also only have access to it for a certain amount of time, usually two to three weeks. Maybe reconsider using Libby to check out Infinite Jest, unless you have a mountain of free time. You'll also notice on Libby, compared to Audible or Apple Books, that the audio quality for audiobooks leaves something to be desired. And unlike Audible, there's no option to choose from higher or lower quality files. Certainly not something that will be a dealbreaker for most people, but something to keep in mind for perfectionists.

489,"Netflix's Best Fantasy TV Shows Will Take You to Magical Realms, Far and Wide","If you're looking for fantasy TV shows,Netflixis where it's at. There's a reason the streamer is still the top dog -- and when it comes to genre entertainment, look no further. When Game of Thrones first hit television screens, audiences weren't ready for the scope that can be achieved with fantasy programming on TV. Since George R.R. Martin's series ended, streamers have thrown a cavalcade of fantasy ideas at the proverbial wall. Of all the streamers, it was Netflix that has steadily brought jaw-dropping tales to the small screen. Think I'm nuts for mentioning Game of Thrones? Just look at titles like The Witcher, Sandman and Shadow and Bone to see the lasting impact HBO's landmark series has left on the culture. That said, there's more to the fantasy genre than these hack-and-slash, magical monster shows. Netflix's range is all-encompassing. Whatever fantasy itch you're looking to scratch -- be it a spooky murder mystery, a dystopian coming-of-age adventure or a colorful pirate journey -- you'll find it here.

Now, all you've got to do is decide what to watch first.Read more:18 Best TV Shows on Netflix to Watch Right Now With Wednesday, Tim Burton has found further gold to mine in the Addams Family story canon. The series follows Wednesday Addams, played with deadpan delight by Jenna Ortega, as she's sent off to attend Nevermore Academy -- the school for outcasts. Throughout the first season, Wednesday investigates a murder mystery plaguing the school and the nearby town of Jericho. She may not make friends easily, but she definitely leaves her mark (as does the program). Based on the Vertigo comic book of the same name, Sweet Tooth takes place post-pandemic in a dystopian future where human babies are born with animal characteristics. These ""Hybrids"" are vilified by the general public and blamed for the extinction-level event known as ""The Great Crumble."" Our hero is a half-boy/half-deer Hybrid named Gus (Christian Convery) who goes on a journey to find his long-lost mother and, potentially, a cure. Eiichiro Oda's One Piece is a global phenomenon. The hit anime got the live-action works on Netflix and, thanks to the insight provided by Oda, this One Piece instantly became a hit with fans the world over. The fun collective performances of the cast and the program's immersive world-building and action-packed vibe proved that a live-action adaptation can absolutely work.The program, like the anime and manga before it, follows Monkey D. Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) as he pursues his dream to become a pirate and find Gol D. Roger's legendary treasure know as, wait for it, the One Piece. Inspired by the comic books written by Joe Hill (Stephen King's son) and illustrated by Gabriel Rodríguez, Locke and Key follows the Locke family as they attempt to pick up the pieces after the unit's patriarch is mysteriously murdered. They move back to Keyhouse, their ancestral home, and soon, weird things begin to happen. The three Locke siblings -- Tyler, (Connor Jessup) Kinsey (Emilia Jones) and Bode (Jackson Robert Scott) -- and their mother, Nina (Darby Stanchfield), discover keys that unlock all sorts of magical secrets that could give the answers behind their father's death. Lockwood & Co. is based on the book series by Jonathan Stroud. The YA genre series follows three young paranormal investigators who fight ghost threats on behalf of their burgeoning psychic detection agency in London. The sharp dialogue and chemistry between the three leads -- Lucy Carlyle, Anthony Lockwood and George Karim -- make this program a fun binge. The Witcher stars Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, the program's titular hero. Based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski -- which first inspired the popular video game franchise -- the Netflix show follows the adventures of Geralt as he hunts monsters. Thanks to the detailed world-building and ensemble performances, The Witcher is a must-watch for any fans of the fantasy genre. Cavill left the series after season 3, with Liam Hemsworth taking over the role. The Sandman hails from the broodingly brilliant mind of Neil Gaiman. Inspired by the characters and storylines from his beloved DC comic book series, the program follows Morpheus (Tom Sturridge), aka the King of Dreams, aka Dream, as he ventures through multiple worlds and timelines to retrieve items stolen from him, rebuild his power, and save The Dreaming -- aka his home. The show's cast is stacked with impressive talent, including Charles Dance, Jenna Coleman, Boyd Holbrook, Gwendoline Christie, Patton Oswalt, Mark Hamill, Stephen Fry, David Thewlis, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Vivienne Acheampong and Mason Alexander Park. Dead Boy Detectives is the second series within Neil Gaiman's Sandman universe to come to Netflix. The spin-off follows two teenage dead boys -- George Rexstrew plays Edwin Payne and Jayden Revri is Charles Rowland -- who decided the afterlife was for suckers and instead joined forces to solve supernatural mysteries. Based on Daniel ""Lemony Snicket"" Handler's hit YA book series, Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events follows Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes) and Sunny Baudelaire (Presley Smith) -- three unlucky orphans who face a headwind of challenges as they seek to unveil the truth about their parents. If only that greedy Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris) would stop getting in their way. Arcane is an animated series that effortlessly elevates the genre. Inspired by the immensely popular League of Legends, the program explores the origin story of two iconic characters from the video game. In the process, this beautifully animated program unpacks heavy issues like class warfare and trauma. Shadow and Bone takes inspiration from Leigh Bardugo's popular Grishaverse novel series. The show follows Alina Starkov (Jessie Mei Li), a young woman who learns she has special abilities. Discovering she's a Grisha (or magic-user) is just the beginning of her adventure as she's faced with the huge responsibility of bringing peace to a war-torn universe. Netflix continues its effort to make the perfect live-action adaptation of a hit anime. Avatar: The Last Airbender pursues story beats familiar from the animated series and follows young Aang, who discovers he's the last Airbender -- the proverbial chosen one who can control the four major elements: air, fire, water and earth. Netflix found enough promise in the fledgling project torenew it for a second and third season. Castlevania hails from comic book writer Warren Ellis and takes inspiration from the Konami video games Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, Castlevania: Curse of Darkness and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The series follows heroes Trevor Belmont (Richard Armitage), Alucard (James Callis) and Sypha Belnades (Alejandra Reynoso) as they fight Dracula and underlings. With an aesthetic that honors the Konami games; compelling writing; and heaps of blood-soaked action, this is a worthy title to add to your watch list. Warrior Nun takes its inspiration from Ben Dunn's comic book Warrior Nun Areala. The series follows Ava Silva, a young woman who wakes up in a morgue with superpowers and a divine artifact stuck in her back. Her journey of self-discovery reveals a new purpose in life: to battle demons and other such hell-beasts on Earth. Why? Because she's now a member of an ancient sect of supernatural nuns known as the Order of the Cruciform Sword. It's a bonkers bloody thrill-ride that lasted two seasons on the streamer -- meaning it won't take too long for you to binge right through it. Matt Groening, creator of animation giants The Simpsons and Futurama, brought his unique sensibilities to Netflix with Disenchantment. The five-season series takes viewers back to medieval Europe and a fictional kingdom named Dreamland. The show follows the misadventures of the rebellious, often-drunk princess Bean (Abbie Jacobson), her demon sidekick Luci (Eric André) and their elf pal Elfo (Nat Faxon) as they galavant through neighboring lands, confront bizarre characters and uncover an overarching conspiracy. The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance is the prequel series to the 1982 Jim Henson cult classic The Dark Crystal. The program follows three brave Gelfling -- Rian, Brea and Deet -- as they spark a rebellion against the Skesksi race after learning the truth about the source of their rulers' power. The series relied heavily on practical effects and puppetry and kept the use of CGI to a minimum. Due to the production costs, the show was canceled after one season. But boy, what a wonderful season it is. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a supernatural YA series created by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the chief creative officer of Archie Comics. He's the same person who brought Riverdale to the CW, which makes sense considering the similar tone both programs have. This Sabrina, unlike '90s sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch, delves heavily into the occult. It's a wonderfully mature take on the character, and it planted the seeds for what the streamer could do with original programming in the genre. Basically, Sabrina walked so Wednesday could run.","From oddball pirates to monster hunters to a peculiar girl named Wednesday, Netflix's fantasy titles are epic.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-fantasy-tv-shows-on-netflix-2024/,
490,"Reasons Why You Should Keep Your Landline Phone, Even in 2025","Mobile network outagescan take down our reception for hours, leaving us strandedwithout one of our most critical lines of accessto the world. What good is a smartphone if it can't phone -- especially in an emergency? Earlier in 2024, an AT&T outage took down services formore than 12 hoursin many of the most populous cities in the US. And in September, a Verizon outage caused some customers to be stuck in SOS mode for a large part of the day. These outages serve as a reminder of theperils of relying only on mobile phones. Maybe it made you rethink the place of a home device that used to be standard issue but is now nearly obsolete: the landline telephone. Here's what to consider when deciding whether to keep (or get) a landline. Those old-fashioned landlines may still have a place, but only 28% of American households have one. Landlines are telephones that connect to specialized wiring in our homes. The iconic image is that of a rotary-dial phone -- usually rented from the phone company -- that either hung on the wall or sat on a counter or table, though push-button and later cordless landlines replaced many of those oldsters in the 1980s. Landline phones connect to one another through a global communication network that was built over more than a century. But as cellphones became broadly available and affordable, many people chose to drop their landlines altogether. A 2022 survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that only about 29% of US adults lived in a house with a landline phone,down from more than 90%in 2004. The crossover happened around 2015, which was also when smartphone salesentered a boom periodthat reshaped the tech industry and helped turniPhonemaker Apple intoone of the world's most highly valued companies. Ann Williams is one of the folks who hasn't given up on their landlines yet. When asked why she keeps hers around, she describes moving to Huntsville, Alabama, after atornado outbreakon April 27, 2011, when dozens of twisters killed at least 250 people and knocked out power for days. Although she moved there after the tornadoes, hearing about the event brought home to her the importance of always needing a phone connection. ""The weather here is so unpredictable,"" she told me in an interview. But landlines have dedicated power and often work even in an outage. ""We remember a day when it was absolutely necessary to have (the landline),"" Williams said. Landline phones operate on a separate infrastructure, built from copper phone lines that are inexpensive to build and rather reliable. They also don't have the drawbacks of cellular networks, like dropped calls, poor and distorted quality or weak reception. A key reason people keep landlines around is that they tend to work even during power outages, which is a big plus for folks whose work involves emergency services, business or health care. Analog fax machines are also built around landline phone systems, which means most hospitals and doctor's offices, as well as policy and law offices, need to keep a landline connection running. Remember cordless phones and phone books? The US Federal Communications Commission isphasing out requirementsfor phone companies to provide landline services (called Plain Old Telephone Service) across the country. As a result, more homes and business offices are being built with ethernet jacks rather thanphone jacks. Landline phone connections aren't cheap, either. CNET corporate cousin AllConnectnotes thatAT&T's traditional home phone plan starts at $48 per month, and you have to use the company for internet too. CenturyLink is cheaper, starting at $30 per month, and Spectrum will charge as little as $20 per month. And not all landlines use copper phone lines. Increasingly, companies are piggybacking their phone systems on their internet connections, a service called Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP. AllConnect currently tracks only three service providers offering old-style landlines: CenturyLink, Comcast Xfinity and Cox. If you're ready to get set up with a landline, call the local phone company and ask about phone services. If you live in an apartment building, it's important for you to find out where the phone junction box is. Typically, the landlord should know and if not, the local phone company should be able to find it. Here are some follow-up questions you want to ask, and what to look for in the answers: If you have a landline but leave it languishing, just sucking money out of your bank account each month, you aren't alone. But there are some ways to make it more useful. Google Voiceis a popular option, giving you a new phone number that acts as a sort of hub. Whenever people call, Google Voice then calls every phone to which you have it connected, be it a home landline, a cellphone, a work phone or anything else. There are other such services too, including Zoom andRingCentral, if you don't like working with Google. A landline phone can also connect withhome security systemsandmedical alert sensorsto help ensure that if you're in an emergency, help will be there as soon as possible. If you're ineligible for a landline, or don't like the service being offered, you do have more options from satellite providers. Companies such as HughesNet and SpaceX can support VoIP over their internet connections. Phone makers like Apple are also slowly buildingsatellite messaginginto their devices. The iPhone 14, which debuted in 2022, has a feature calledEmergency SOS, which can connect with a satellite to send location data to your friends or an emergency text to authorities.",Going old school has its advantages when huge mobile network outages happen.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/reasons-why-you-should-keep-your-landline-phone-even-in-2025/,
491,"With Apple Getting Into Modems, It Needs to Remember the iPhone 4","Apple's work on a long rumored wireless modem appears to finally be coming to a head. Anew reportfrom Bloomberg's Mark Gurman earlier this month suggests that next spring'srumored iPhone SE refreshwill bring the first Apple-designed wireless modem, a noteworthy shift from the company's recent reliance on chips from Qualcomm, the current industry leader for cellular modems. According to Gurman, Apple will take a gradual ramp-up with its modem ambitions. Next year will see the hardware appear in the more affordable iPhone SE, theiPhone 17 ""Slim""and some cellular-connected entry-level iPads. He says that the first-generation modem is not as ""advanced"" as theQualcomm chipsin today's flagshipiPhone 16 lineand isn't capable of handling higher-frequency 5G spectrum like millimeter-wave, which Verizon and AT&T have deployed in parts of major cities, airports and stadiums for super-fast connections. The modem is also said to be limited to four-channel carrier aggregation, which is a drop-off from Qualcomm's latest chips. Carrier aggregation allows for combining multiple bands of wireless spectrum to increase data speeds. While Apple's initial modems may not be as fast as Qualcomm's latest, Gurman says it ""caps out at download speeds of about 4 gigabits per second"" in lab tests. While the real world is very different from controlled lab experiments, if Apple can deliver even a fraction of that bandwidth consistently it should be fine for most people's daily use of streaming, messaging, video calling and social media sharing. Though higher-end modems are said to be coming from Apple in 2026 and 2027 that might outperform Qualcomm's future chips, plenty is riding on Apple to nail its modem right out of the box. You only need to look back at 2010'siPhone 4 ""antennagate""to see how badly messing with connectivity can go. Steve Jobs referred to the situation as ""Antennagate,"" but said that getting signal loss from holding the iPhone 4 was ""not unique"" when compared to other smartphones. TheiPhone 4was Apple's first big redesign of the iPhone and featured an all-new antenna design with cutouts along the sides of the phone that allowed the company to turn the phone's stainless steel bands into parts of the antenna for Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and, of course, cellular connectivity. The problem, as users quickly found out, was that holding the phone in your hand without a case could easily interfere with the signal. Thisled to a press conference, apublic letter, software updates to fix how cellular signal strength is displayed, lawsuits, free cases andeventually a settlement. Despiteleaking when it was mistakenly left in a barmonths before release, Apple's famed secrecy may have played a role in limiting public testing of the iPhone 4. The leak showed that Apple was testing its phone in cases designed to mimic the appearance of an iPhone 3G or 3GS. Ultimately using a case helped fix the ""antennagate"" issue, which largely appeared when users would use their phones without one. ABloomberg report in 2010, however, suggested that at least one Apple engineer raised concerns to management about the design. The saga was ablack eye for Applethough obviously it did little to slow the iPhone's meteoric rise. By the time theiPhone 4Srolled around, the antenna issues were solved and today's iPhones continue to feature cutouts along both sides of the phone and work without any cellular connectivity issues (little cutouts for antennas along the sides of devices have also become commonplace on Android phones from Samsung, Google and others). Gurman says that ""Apple has been secretly testing the new modem on hundreds of devices deployed to employees globally"" and ""doing quality assurance testing with its carrier partners around the world,"" which is good news for the new modem. ""There is always a risk with introducing new silicon, especially one that controls so much of the experience, and that's why I always thought they would introduce the first generation on a cheaper, less risky device like the iPhone SE or iPad Mini,"" Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, says. He notes that by taking this approach, Apple can ""get the modems out into the real world and squash whatever bugs exist without risking the mainline iPhone business profitability."" Avi Greengart, president and lead analyst of Techsponential, seems to agree. ""Apple (and Intel before it) has been working on this for a long time, but Qualcomm and MediaTek have significant leads in terms of 5G modem performance today, and that gap is likely growing,"" he says.

492,I Tried the $299 Feno Smartbrush to Clean My Teeth. It's a Mouthful,"I couldn't stop myself from giggling. A sudsy giggle. I was brushing my teeth, but this was no ordinary toothbrush I was using. It was theFeno Smartbrush— and with its 18,000 bristles, it was navigating all of my teeth, top and bottom, at the same time. The vibration was startlingly different. The entire lower part of my face was shaking, from my gumline to the base of my jaw. It felt like a massage for my teeth, cheeks and the craniofacial muscles surrounding my mouth. Foamy residue escaped onto my chin and chest. The Feno Smartbrush is a mouthful. It was a mouthful. In a good way. For an anxious, teeth-grinding adult like me, the silly visual in the mirror of my mouth vibrating for 20 seconds was worth the feeling that came along with it. Plus, it removed all those tricky goji berry remnants that always seem to evade my regular electric toothbrush. The Smartbrush is a U-shaped device, with top and bottom sections like the mouthguards that athletes use, attached to a fist-sized handle that holds the power source and a camera. It's the flagship product of Feno, a 3-year-old company driven by the belief that ""transformative oral health technology"" is on the cusp of a breakthrough moment. It was created by Dr. Kenny Brown, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who's also Feno's CEO and a co-founder. He designed it to address problems he saw firsthand with his patients. ""We believe oral health is your overall health,""  Brown tells me when we meet atBioscienceLA, which for Feno doubles as a nonprofit organization for health tech companies and its brick-and-mortar. ""When it comes to oral hygiene, patients tend to fail in two aspects: time and technique."" How many of us really put in the 2-plus minutes of brushing that dentists recommend? And are we really putting brush to tooth as effectively as we should? Feno cuts the time to just 20 seconds, and its Smartbrush does the work for you. It's a radically different approach from the normal options available for oral care at home, and retails at a breathtaking $299 for a three-month starter kit. There are other high-end, high-tech devices, including Curaprox's U-shapedSamba robotic toothbrushand thePhilips Sonicare Prestige 9900, which packs some AI into a more standard-looking electric toothbrush. But neither of those devices has Feno's customization features, like six variations of its U-shaped, top-and-bottom mouthpiece. Feno also stands apart in tracking and analyzing your brushing habits and your mouth as a whole, with reports through a $10 monthly Feno Plus membership intended to support long-term preventive care. Brown's training and experience is another differentiating factor. I did my trial with the$299 Founder's Edition bundle, which contains the Smartbrush (comprising the Feno Smarthandle and SnapCharger), a TrueFit Mouthpiece, three tubes of mint-flavored XyFoam toothpaste, a tongue scraper and three months of Feno Plus for access to personalized health insights and virtual oral health coaching. First, I sent in selfies of my mouth through Feno'sFitKit, an app that allows the Feno team to map, size and pair it with one of six mouthpieces, and waited for my images to be analyzed and approved. The kit arrived in the mail a week later, in a large, well-designed box. After the unboxing, I downloaded the Feno app and connected it to my newly charged Smartbrush. (The Apple MagSafe-like charger attaches to the back of Feno's Smarthandle, looking rather like a stethoscope.) Here, I was able to customize my Feno experience. I could change the speed and time of the brush while the AI tracked my brushing cadence. The vibration of the brush allowed me to maneuver it around the sides of my mouth, which provided a pleasant jaw massage in the process. You use the Smarthandle to take a scan of your mouth. Over the next two weeks, I used the Smartbrush twice a day for 20 seconds at a time. Once connected to Feno's Wi-Fi network (this will not affect your home's internet connection), I could also connect my Smartbrush to Feno's app, which monitored my brushing and scanning cadence. After brushing, I positioned the Smartbrush 10 inches from my face and pressed a button to capture and send data concerning my oral health to Feno's team for feedback. With regular use, the reports come back every two weeks with insights about the condition of your teeth, gums, tongue and soft tissue, plus a digital health score, summary analysis of your mouth and feedback to improve or adjust your mouth scans. With consistency, the embedded scanner will learn your mouth and note any changes that occur. ""[Over time] you're going to have the biggest longitudinal data set on the mouth, actionable data made as effortless as possible, so that it can be done as easily as once a day,"" Brown said. ""You can then get insight into what's happening in your mouth."" Feno will send you regular reports on the state of your oral health. After my trial run with the Smartbrush, I visited Feno's facilities, where the product is tested, packaged and shipped out, to speak with Brown about the device, its AI integration and the state of oral health care. Feno's prototyping space, fulfillment center and company office all sit within the health tech hub's long, single-story brick exterior; blue and green letters read ""BioscienceLA"" across its windows. Inside, shiny white plaster walls and squeaky-clean floors make up the building's sleek, modern interior. Dr. Kenny Brown is the creator of the Feno Smartbrush. This is where members of the equally passionate core team — eight people, including three dentists — can be found. (It's also where Brown can be found chatting on the phone with customers about postpurchase feedback.) Our conversation took place in Feno's prototyping office, the largest of the three spaces I toured. Nearby, 3D printers for prototyping emit a soothing hum and ambient orange glow. Physical evolutions of Feno's TrueFit Mouthpiece lie to my right. As an oral surgeon and entrepreneur, Brown is an anomaly, a Black oral surgeon in an industry wherejust under 4%of dentists, dental specialists and oral surgeons are Black. With his creation of the AI-powered Smartbrush, he's also a pioneer. He radiates a passion for oral care — and humanity. (We'll take a moment here to acknowledge another pioneer,Dr. Bobbi Peterson, the Shark Tank-famous orthodontist who invented the Big Mouth electric toothbrush.) Brown estimates that nearly 50% of American adults have some form of gum disease and chronic inflammation. Feno, he says, could address this challenge with ""full mouth,"" U-shaped products. ""The idea is better, faster, easier — but it also levels a playing field,"" Brown said. ""Doing this on a technology front shows, 'Look, these solutions are for everyone.' At the end of the day, it's to serve others."" The TrueFit Mouthpiece began with over 20,000 patient digital impressions to inform a mouth-sizing algorithm, which translated into over 100,000 designs of various shapes, widths, heights and bristle configurations. ""It can be extremely risky and expensive to make thousands of prototypes. We used a combination of clinical knowledge, digital impressions, generative AI technology and 3D printing to help us create [ours],"" Brown said. ""Efficacy is the number one thing. If it doesn't work, it doesn't matter."" The design of Feno's mouthpiece went through many iterations. Brown and his team used generative AI — custom algorithms written with design software Rhino 3D and Grasshopper —  to test and optimize for the most effective mouthpiece, including features like ""bristle contact with tooth surfaces and your gum line."" Those iterations became several hundred 3D-printed prototypes, tested again on patients to ensure clinical standards. Today, Feno has six TrueFit Mouthpiece variations that differentiate in dental arch, jawline and oral cavity dimensions, depending on customers' needs. Whether that's arch width or depth, a crooked tooth or gum recession, the goal is that all 18,000 bristles on your Feno TrueFit Mouthpiece touch all of your teeth — 250 strokes per tooth — so you can brush your teeth within 20 seconds. The Smarthandle will pause and alert you to soften your brushing pressure if need be. The TrueFit Mouthpiece connects to Feno's Smarthandle, which uses camera vision, artificial intelligence that can analyze visual data. Each time you scan your mouth with the Smarthandle's embedded scanner, it tracks signs of poor oral health or abnormalities that need attention and compiles it into a data report. While these insights are not considered diagnostic, Feno has a dentist quality-checking information for precision and accuracy. ""We really try to be intentional about what we're giving customers,"" Brown said. ""Seeing people and meeting them where they're at is the best form of care, something you cannot capture withanytech. That's humanity."" For me, in that two-week trial run, the Smartbrush worked. My gums were initially sore (Feno notes this might happen) but my teeth felt… purified, as if all 18,000 bristles, vibrating in various directions, had extracted all the plaque in my mouth. As new to the market as Feno is, there's a lot yet to unfold about how well the Smartbrush performs and what the oral analytics reveal over time. At $299 upfront plus $10 a month, this system is asking you to make a significant investment. Still, I'm intrigued by this innovative approach. After my trial, I decided to keep my Smartbrush. For the last three years, I've been told by two different dentists that I will need veneers before I'm 40. (An alarming statement for a 29-year-old who's had braces twice.) Every six months, I leave my checkup increasingly anxious about what's happening inside my mouth — or, to Brown's point, my body — with no solution or long-term plan. Maybe this is the start of one. As always, as a savvy consumer, you should do your research, talk to your dentist and consider your comfort level with spending on a pricey cutting-edge device. Alongside brushing your teeth, twice a day.","It has 18,000 bristles and a U-shaped mouthpiece, and it does the brushing for you.

493,Best Multidevice VPNs,"We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability. What to consider in a VPN for multiple devices Device support If you want to use a VPN on multiple devices, think about the operating systems you need an app for -- Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, web browsers and routers -- then make sure your VPN provider supports those platforms. Additionally, make sure your desired VPN company allows enough simultaneous devices for your needs. Internet speed loss All VPNs slow down your internet speeds somewhat by nature of encrypting your connection. The fastest VPNs deliver an average internet download speed loss of 25% or less, which should be unnoticeable on a reliable internet connection. Privacy Look for essential privacy features like a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a strict no-logging policy that's been audited. Transparency reports are nice trust signals as well. Privacy-conscious users should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. Server network Think about the total number of servers a VPN offers as well as the number of individual countries it has servers in. At the high end, comprehensive VPNs feature thousands of servers spread across 100-plus countries. 60 or more countries should work for most folks. Streaming capabilities VPNs let you make it look like you're connecting from a different city, state or even country, letting you unblock region-restricted content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock, Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad or foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries at home. Make sure your VPN unblocks content on apps that you want to watch. Cost Most VPNs offer monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year subscriptions. Expect to pay $5 to $15 per month, $40 to $100 per year or $60 to $100-plus for a two or more year plan. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. Extensive features at a great price SCORE Surfsharkoffers nearly unrivaled value for cost. You'll pay just $15.45 per month, $48 per year ($60 annually after a 12-month introductory period) or $56 total for the first two years (then $60 per year). Its prices are well below those of rivals like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Despite its wallet-friendly price, Surfshark doesn't cut corners. It sports unlimited simultaneous connections, so you can stream foreign Netflix libraries on your Amazon Fire TV while your partner uses a VPN on their iPad and your kid games with the Windows client app running. We were impressed with its various features, including a kill switch, obfuscation, split tunneling and even a GUI Linux app. You've got plenty of connection choices with Surfshark’s more than 3,200 servers in 100 countries. There's an app for virtually every platform, including Apple TV -- a device some VPN providers still don't support. Surfshark performed well, delivering a 17% average internet download speed loss, which is perfectly acceptable for 4K video streaming, gaming or Zoom calls. Rivals like NordVPN (11%) and ExpressVPN (25%) provide better speeds, albeit for more money. Surfshark offers unrestricted simultaneous device usage while providing apps for tons of gadgets. Perfect for power users SCORE NordVPNis so popular because of its fast connections, privacy-focused features and excellent geo-unblocking for streaming services. Its intuitive design doesn't compromise on settings and makes it an outstanding choice for casual VPN newcomers and seasoned power users alike. With support for nearly every platform, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS, Fire TV, browsers and even Apple TV, Nord is great for use on multiple devices. Its generous 10 simultaneous connections may not technically be unlimited, but most folks likely won’t come near needing that many active VPNs running. In our 2024speed tests, NordVPN led the pack as the fastest VPN, sporting an overall average internet download speed loss of just 11.1%. Our CNET Labs team clocked an average speed loss on its NordLynx VPN protocol of merely 3.2% with Windows and 12.6% on MacOS. With OpenVPN, its speed loss was a blazing-fast 10.1% average on MacOS and 18.6% using Windows. We do recommend an OpenVPN connection for more privacy-critical users, but other users should be fine with using the marginally speedier NordLynx protocol. With apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS, browsers and even Apple TV, Nord runs on almost any platform you can think of. We appreciate NordVPN's commitment to privacy and security. In addition to features like Onion over VPN (Tor) and a Double VPN, which deliver additional encryption, a2023 audit by Deloittebacked up its no-log claims for improved transparency. On the entertainment side, we had no issues streaming US and UK Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus libraries on most devices. NordVPN’s global server network comprises more than 6,800 servers spanning 113 countries. That’s a little more than the international reach of competitors like Surfshark (100) and ExpressVPN (105). At $13 per month, $60 per year or $83 total for two years, NordVPN sets you back less initially than premium VPNrivals like ExpressVPNbut more than budget-oriented companies like Surfshark and PIA. Subsequent price hikes drive the price to $140 per year, which aligns with many other VPN providers, including Express. With support for a smattering of devices, including Apple TV, NordVPN is great for folks who need the fastest possible internet speeds. Privacy protection and transparency SCORE ExpressVPNis CNET’s Editors’ Choice for thebest VPNoverall, but it falls short of taking the top spot in this list because it only allows for eight simultaneous connections, which is a slight increase from its previous limit of five. Granted, eight simultaneous connections should be enough for the average VPN user, but it’s still not quite as generous as others in the field that allow an unlimited number of simultaneous connections. That said, ExpressVPN is a solid option for pretty much any device you’d want to protect with a VPN. The overall app experience is consistent across the board and is easy to use on any platform. You'll even enjoyExpressVPN's Apple TV app. Linux users will need to use the command line interface because ExpressVPN doesn’t offer a native GUI for Linux machines. If you want to protect all of your connected devices with a router setup, ExpressVPN’s ownAircove VPN routeris by far the simplest solution -- if you’re willing to pony up $190 for the hardware. ExpressVPN is among the pricier VPN options, but it’s worth it because it’s reasonably fast, great for streaming and delivers top-notch privacy. While its 24.8% average internet speed loss was slower than top performers NordVPN (11%) and Surfshark (17%), it’s still plenty quick for daily use, even with bandwidth applications like gaming or 4K video streaming. With ExpressVPN, you’ll have access to a massive network of servers spread out across 105 different countries, along with crucial privacy protections like DNS leak protection, akill switchand a RAM-only server infrastructure. Granted, we experienced a serious issue with DNS leaks using ExpressVPN’s split tunneling on Windows, although the bug only affected an estimated 1% or less of users, according to Express. Thankfully, Express handled it swiftly and transparently, fixing the problem while publishing a blog post for commendable transparency. We still recommend Express (even if it’s not the top choice for multidevice users). Live chat support is available 24/7, and a knowledge base filled with helpful guides is easily accessible on the ExpressVPN website. A monthly subscription costs $13, which is about on par with most other premium VPNs, but its $100 yearly plan (renewing at $117) and $140 for the first two years package (renewing at $150 annually) are considerably more expensive than some of the other more budget-friendly options, like PIA or Surfshark. Budget-friendly and transparent SCORE Private Internet Accessis a superb VPN for multiple devices that doesn't break the bank. Perhaps most importantly, PIA doesn't limit your simultaneous connections. With support for a slew of platforms, including an Apple TV app and a user-friendly Linux GUI app, PIA is a solid choice for multi-device needs. You can use your VPN to stream Prey on Disney Plus via Android TV, securely surf the web on your MacBook Pro or Windows laptop and protect yourself from DDoS attacks whilegaming on your PC. PIA sets you back just $12 per month, $40 per year or $79 every three years, making it one of thecheapest VPNs on the market. We didn't experience any DNS leaks during testing. PIA features open-source apps and boasts one of the most easily digestible privacy policies. We encountered a high average internet speed loss in our 2024 testing, resulting in a 49% degradation. For reference, we generally find 20% or less perfectly usable, with many providers offering well below that -- like Nord with its 11% average speed loss, or Surfshark at 17%. If you have fast internet of at least 100Mbps, you should be fine, but folks with slow or unreliable connections like satellite internet might need a faster VPN. With servers in 91 countries, you've got a decent network of locations to pick from. All of its apps are open-source, and we appreciate its regular third-party audits as well as transparency reports. On the other hand, its US jurisdiction may give some privacy-minded users a reason to consider other options. Streaming was solid: PIA successfully unblocked Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video on US and UK servers with most devices we tested. PIA is an excellent choice if you're on a budget but want a secure VPN, although gamers and folks with slower internet should look elsewhere for faster VPNs. The only free plan we recommend SCORE If you want a VPN that’s transparent, privacy-focused and available for free on your devices, then Swiss-basedProton VPNis worth a look. Proton VPN is the only trulyfree VPNthat CNET recommends because its free tier is fast, secure and doesn’t impose usage limits. The free plan is available on all major platforms, so you can use it across your compatible devices, but it’s limited to a single device connection at a time. There's even an Apple TV app so you can access foreign Netflix, Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer and Amazon Prime Video libraries on your TV, but the Apple TV app is limited to paid plans. If you opt for a paid subscription, you’ll be able to connect up to 10 devices simultaneously, which is more than ExpressVPN, the same as NordVPN but fewer than Surfshark, IPVanish and PIA. (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Proton VPN is an open-source VPN provider that emphasizes privacy. Paying users can choose to run their connection through Proton VPN’s wholly owned Secure Core servers, which are physically housed in Switzerland, on a former military base in Iceland and in an underground data center in Sweden. This adds another level of privacy to your connection by routing your traffic through the Secure Core servers first, before exiting through VPN servers in your selected location. You’ll also get privacy protections like DNS leak protection, a kill switch, Tor over VPN andobfuscation. Linux users have the option of connecting via the CLI or using Proton’s native Linux GUI. If you’re into streaming, then you may want to consider another option, because Proton VPN’s speeds tend to fluctuate dramatically. Customer support is also a bit behind the competition due to Proton VPN’s lack of live chat support. The VPN’s pricing is in the middle of the pack at $10 per month, $60 for your first year, or $108 for your first two years (Proton VPN renews at $80 annually for the one- and two-year plans). We don’t recommend signing on with a single VPN provider for more than a year at a time, due to how quickly things tend to shift in the VPN industry. Surfsharkis the best VPN for several devices because of its unlimited simultaneous connections, vast app availability and feature-rich design that doesn’t break the bank. NordVPN, with excellent device support and 10 simultaneous connections, coupled with its best-in-class internet speed maintenance, is a great choice for folks with serious bandwidth requirements, like gamers or streaming video fanatics. ExpressVPN, while not truly unlimited with its eight simultaneous device allowances, works for most folks while delivering outstanding performance for everything from security to streaming.  *Smart television sets running Google TV/Android TV or Fire TV can download VPN apps directly, while LG's webOS, Samsung's Tizen OS and Roku TVs require a router VPN. **For Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Vivaldi. VPNs deliver a ton of benefits for users of all types. When using a virtual private network, websites and apps won't be able to see your physical location because the service masks your IP address, replacing it with the VPN server's IP address and making it look as if you're connecting from a different region, which can even include a foreign country. Using a VPN also encrypts your internet traffic, hiding your online activity from your internet service provider and other potential snoops. VPNs can usually (but not always) add an extra boost to your security, they can prevent connection throttling whilegamingand assist in viewingstreamingcontent that would otherwise be blocked due to geographical restrictions. Installing a VPN on multiple decides is usually possible, but some companies may limit your connections when using one. In essence, you can load a provider's VPN service onto as many devices as you'd like, but the app may work simultaneously on a limited number at one time. Nowadays, it's common to use a plethora of electronics daily. If that's your reality, you'll probably be interested in using a VPN to protect your privacy when using your tablets, computers, gaming consoles, phones and other streaming devices. Our CNET experts thoroughly tested dozens of virtual private networks, looking at everything from content unblocking and DNS leaks to speed loss. We curated the below list of top VPNs for use with several devices with simultaneous connection allowances and operating system support in mind. In addition, we also considered server networks, geo-unblocking, speed loss, security and app features. Let's take a look at the best multidevice VPNs for protecting your arsenal of gadgets. Based on our years of experience using, testing and researching VPNs, these are the most pertinent factors to consider when choosing a VPN for multiple devices: If you have a lot of devices that you want to protect with a VPN, you’ll want a VPN that allows for enough simultaneous connections to cover all of your devices. Most VPNs offer at least five simultaneous connections, but some offer up to an unlimited number. Before purchasing a subscription, check with the VPN provider to see if it offers enough simultaneous connections for all of the devices on which you want to use the VPN. Normally, you can install a VPN on as many devices as you please, but you're limited in how many active VPN sessions you can have. For instance, you can install a VPN on 20-plus devices, but if there's a 10 simultaneous device limit, you can only have a VPN running actively on 10 of those gadgets at a time. Your VPN should be compatible with all of the devices you want to use it on. Many VPNs have apps that are compatible with the most popular platforms likeWindows,Mac,iOSandAndroid. For streaming, look for Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV support.Linuxusers may have issues finding a VPN that offers a useful, native app for Linux. Even if the VPN has a native GUI for Linux, it may not offer the full functionality that its MacOS and Windows counterparts. If you want to protect all of your connected devices, independent of their individual compatibility with the VPN, you can connect using a VPN-compatible router. It’s a more cost-intensive and technically demanding way to go, but it effectively eliminates compatibility issues. Privacy is one of the most important considerations for any VPN, regardless of what you need one for. Make sure the VPN you’re using for all of your devices offers basic privacy protections like AES 256-bit and ChaCha20 encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a no-logs policy. Check the provider’s privacy policy and look for trust signals like transparency reports and external audits. Whether you’re streaming, gaming or simply browsing the internet, you’ll want a VPN that can deliver fast connection speeds. A VPN will naturally slow down your connection speeds, often by 50% or more. With a fast VPN, your speeds shouldn’t decrease by more than 20% and the speed drop shouldn’t be noticeable for most online activities. The breadth of a VPN’s network of servers is an important consideration for various reasons. For one, if you’re traveling, there’s a better chance that you’ll have a server located close by, meaning that your VPN connection should be faster and more stable wherever you are. Additionally, more server locations mean access to a potentially wider selection of geographically restricted content from other regions. Before purchasing a subscription, check the VPN’s server page to ensure its network covers the locations that you need. Paying more for a VPN doesn’t necessarily translate into greater platform compatibility or a more generous simultaneous connection count. Some of the more budget-friendly VPNs allow for far more simultaneous connections than many of the more expensive options. Depending on the VPN you choose, you could pay from about $40 to $100 per year, so there are options for every budget. Most VPNs are generally pretty simple to set up and use on most compatible devices. As with any product or service you purchase, it’s good to have competent support staff on hand to answer questions and easy-to-follow setup and troubleshooting guides to reference for help with any issues you may run into. The top VPNs in the market today typically offer live chat customer support and have extensive knowledge bases filled with guides for setting up and using their services on all sorts of platforms. We evaluated the best VPNs for multiple devices based on each provider’s platform compatibility as well as its simultaneous connection allowance. We also evaluated how each VPN performs on different devices and operating systems along with its overall consistency and functionality across platforms. In addition, we looked at core VPN considerations like features, privacy protections, speeds and network coverage when coming up with our list. IPVanishprovides unlimited simultaneous connections so you can use a VPN on your phone, tablet, computer, streaming box and any other devices at once without issue. By comparison, many of its competitors remain selective; NordVPN and Proton VPN offer 10 simultaneous connections while ExpressVPN allows just eight. Additionally, IPVanish features VPN apps for nearly every platform imaginable. It's even one of the few companies with anApple TV app. A handful of providers, including Surfshark, Proton VPN, NordVPN, PIA, ExpressVPN, PrivadoVPN, IPVanish, PureVPN, FlowVPN, Tailscale, VPNIFY, SafeShell and SwizzVPN, offer downloadable TVOS applications. There's even a graphical user interface for IPVanish'sLinux app, which is still a rarity. We like that IPVanish's apps are user-friendly and uncomplicated. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a VPN newcomer, you won't be confused about enabling it. Its exceptional streaming support -- we successfully unblocked Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and other apps -- makes this an excellent VPN for entertainment. We didn't find any leaks in our 2024 tests, but we clocked an average 44% internet download speed loss, which is well below thefastest VPNs. With servers in 56 countries, IPVanish falls well short of competitors like NordVPN (113), Surfshark (100 countries) and ExpressVPN (105). We found servers close to us, you'll want to consult IPVanish's server location list to ensure it's a VPN provider that works for your needs. You'll pay $13 per month, $40 annually (before a price hike to $90 after your initial 12 months of service) or $53 for two years (after 24 months, that cost spikes to $90 each year). IPVanish is cheaper than NordVPN and ExpressVPN but more expensive than Private Internet Access and Surfshark. Ultimately, IPVanish is a decent VPN that you can use on nearly any device -- including your Apple TV -- with no limits on simultaneous users. Other VPNs provide significantly faster speeds, more country locations, stronger privacy and overall better value. Read our IPVanish review. With its user-friendly app design, split tunneling and excellent streaming service geo-unblocking,Hotspot Shieldis a decent VPN for casual users. It features a sizable network comprised of over 3,200 servers in more than 80 countries. Hotspot Shield uses AES 256-bit encryption for solid industry-standard privacy. Its closed-source proprietary OpenSSL-based Catapult Hydra VPN protocol and US jurisdiction mean it’s not ideal for more privacy-conscious folks. While Hotspot Shield does support 10 simultaneous devices, its underwhelming privacy and transparency make it tough to recommend when its VPN rivals offer more benefits like faster speeds, greater simultaneous device allowances and lower subscription costs. Read our Hotspot Shield review. TunnelBearprovides unlimited simultaneous connections without breaking the bank. It sports 256-bit encryption, split tunneling and several VPN protocols including WireGuard and OpenVPN as well as IKEv2. However, TunnelBear falls short in a lot of categories. Despite a high 5,000-plus server network, TunnelBear only spans 47 countries. In our testing, its unreliable connectivity often resulted in high internet speed loss. Plus, TunnelBear only supports a handful of platforms, like Windows, MacOS, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. At a minimum, we’d expect a Linux installer and at this point, probably an Apple TV app. If you need an affordable VPN for general use TunnelBear is acceptable, but we suggest one of thebest cheap VPNs, like Surfshark, IPVanish or PIA instead. Read our TunnelBear review. The best multidevice VPN is Surfshark because it offers a user-friendly app for nearly any device -- including Apple TV -- along with unlimited simultaneous connections. PIA also boasts unrestricted connections at the same time. While not unlimited, NordVPN and Proton VPN provide 10 simultaneous connections, while Express delivers eight. You can use almost every VPN on multiple devices, although there might be limits. Providers including IPVanish, Surfshark and PIA deliver unlimited simultaneous connections, while companies such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN restrict you to eight and 10, respectively. You can have multiple devices on one VPN with an active subscription and the various client apps installed. Alternatively, you can run a VPN on your router, which covers all devices on your network. To set up a VPN on multiple devices, you'll download the app for that operating system -- like Windows, MacOS, Android or iOS -- then log in with your username and password.

494,iOS 18.2 Is Here: Crucial Steps Before Updating Your iPhone,"I'm guessing you don't want to hear me bang on about backups, especiallyiPhonebackups, but take it from someone who's been burned: The short time you spend now to make a good backup of your iPhone can save you many hours and many headaches if (improbably, yes) upgrading toiOS 18.2goes poorly. I'm not talking about any regular backup, though. Hopefully you already have your Apple Account settings configured to automatically back up the phone to iCloud, which is invaluable when youupgrade to a new iPhone, and just for everyday peace of mind. I'm talking about creating anarchivethat can save your hide in the unlikely event something goes wrong with the iOS 18.2 update. Then you'll feel more secure installing iOS 18.2 so you can get to new features such asGenmojiandVisual Intelligence, along with those found in iOS 18.1 liketext message improvements,enhancements in Apple Mapsandmirroring your iPhone from a Mac in MacOS Sequoia. You're probably accustomed to using iCloud Backup to maintain a regular fallback for your data. It works in the background (when you're asleep and charging your device) and involves the least amount of backup friction, as long as you have sufficient iCloud disk space available. Go toSettings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Backupand turn onBack Up This iPhoneif it's not already active. However, when it comes to moving to a full release version of iOS, such as from iOS 17 to iOS 18, an iCloud Backup introduces a problem: You cannot restore from that cloud backup if you revert back to iOS 17. And unfortunately, iCloud keeps just the most recent backup -- you can't pick and choose from previous backup iterations. If you try to use an iOS 18 cloud backup to restore back to iOS 17, you'll get an error. (Making an archive is also an important step when you install iOS betas.) This is why you need to archive a backup on your computer. iOS warns you if you try to restore from an iCloud backup made under the iOS beta. Before you create this archived backup, you should decide if you want to enable one of the options,Encrypt local backup. For security, this feature scrambles the data to prevent someone with access to your computer from accessing it. This option also preserves sensitive information in the backup such as saved passwords and personal data in the Health and Fitness apps. The downside is that it requires you to create a separate password for the backup. If you forget or lose that password, the entire backup is useless. And so you should write this password down somewhere you can easily retrieve it. In the context of creating an iOS 17 backup as a fallback for installing the iOS 18 beta, you'll have to decide if that's an acceptable trade-off. Making this type of backup requires only disk space and some patience: Create an archive backup of a connected iPhone on the computer (MacOS shown here). Taking the extra step of marking the backup as an archive protects it from being overwritten by the next local backup or automatically deleted if the Mac is low on space. Set the backup as an archive. The iTunes app is still the main conduit for working with a connected iPhone under Windows. Open iTunes and do the following: With an archive in place, you can start using the iOS 18 beta secure in the knowledge that should anything warrant a retreat to iOS 17, you can quickly get your iPhone back into service. For more, here is what you can do with the newiPhone 16 camera buttonandyour monthly reminder to clear your iPhone cache.",Give yourself some peace of mind and make sure you have a solid iPhone backup before moving to the next version.,CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ios-18-2-is-here-crucial-steps-before-updating-your-iphone/,
495,Premier League Soccer: Livestream Arsenal vs. Everton From Anywhere,"Arsenal will be hoping to get back to winning ways in the English Premier League on Saturday as they host an Everton side looking to pull themselves further clear of the relegation zone. The Gunners dropped points against Fulham last time out, with the gap between Mikel Arteta's side and league leaders Liverpool currently standing at six points going into today's fixtures. The hosts nevertheless bounced back from their 1-1 draw with the Cottagers with an impressive 3-0 win over Monaco in the UEFA Champions League in midweek. They come up against an Everton side currently in 15th who have had a week off following last weekend's canceled Merseyside derby, thanks to Storm Darragh. Arsenal take on Everton on Saturday, Dec. 14, at the Emirates Stadium in north London, with kickoff set for3 p.m. GMTlocal time.

497,Gift Your Gamer An Xbox Game Pass Subscription This Holiday Season,"If you don't know what to give the gamer in your life this holiday season, an Xbox Game Pass subscription is a great choice. Microsoft launched Game Pass in 2017, and since then, the gaming service has grown to be one of thebest valuesfor gamers. All Game Pass plans offer member discounts for non-Game Pass titles and other perks, but figuring out which plan is right for you can be difficult. That choice can be especially tough after Microsoft removed its Game Pass Console plan and replaced it withGame Pass Standard. The company also increased the price ofGame Pass Ultimatefrom $17 to $20 a month. I've covered the service in the past, includingfuture releasesand whether Game Pass Ultimatewill save you moneycompared to buying single games. And with all the new titles that Microsoft announced would be joining the service as Day 1 releases, likeCall of Duty: Black Ops 6, you might be wondering what the difference is between different Game Pass plans. Here's what you need to know about the Game Pass plans so you can decide which one is right for your needs. Game Pass Core is tied for the cheapest Game Pass option at $10 a month. It's aimed at console gamers who want to play online multiplayer. Here's what to know about Game Pass Core. With this plan, you can access over40 titles, including Doom: Eternal, Fallout 4 and Halo 5. You also get access to online multiplayer with this subscription. You don't get as many games with Game Pass Core as other plans on this list. This level of the service rarely adds new titles, and subscribers won't be able to access Day 1 releases. That means you won't be able to play the upcoming Indiana Jones game upon release. And sorry, Star Wars fans, but EA Play's not included in this plan. If you mostly play online multiplayer games, like Halo or Gears of War, and you only play on console, this is the plan for you. You're mostly paying for access to play online multiplayer with this plan, but the added discounts and game library — despite its smallish size — are nice perks, too. PC Game Pass is $12 a month, and it caters to PC gamers who want a large library of games and Day 1 releases. Here's what to know about PC Game Pass. This subscription plan gives you access to about 400 Game Pass titles, which is most of the Game Pass library. New games are usually added every month, and you'll have access to Day 1 releases as well, so you'll always have something new to play. This plan also includes EA Play, which gives you access to EA games, like the Madden series and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As you might have guessed, you need a PC for this plan so console gamers need not apply. Even if you have a PC, machine requirements might limit which games you can play and how well others run on your PC. People who only play on PC. It may not offer every game in the Game Pass library, but PC Game Pass does bring new games to the service every month, including a host of Day 1 releases coming soon. Game Pass Standard is the newest Game Pass plan; it costs $15 a month and replaces the Game Pass Console plan. Here's what to know about Game Pass Standard. The major draw of the Game Pass Standard plan is that it offers subscribers a library of over 300 games, which is about three-quarters of the entire Game Pass library. Subscribers can play games likeMafia: The Definitive Edition, as well as the Halo and Gears of War series. You can also play online multiplayer for Game Pass and non-Game Pass games. This plan is for console gamers only, so PC gamers need not subscribe. And while Game Pass Standard has a decent-size library of games, it doesn't include EA Play or get Day 1 releases. That doesn't mean those games won't come to Game Pass Standard eventually.Xbox said previouslythat those games could arrive on this plan up to a year or more later. Console gamers who don't mind waiting a little longer to play some games and don't need to  play on PC or mobile devices. While you might not be able to play major games on Day 1, like the upcoming Gears of War game, you'll probably be able to play them later. And if you only play on Xbox consoles and don't need access to PC games or features like cloud gaming, this is the plan for you. This is the most expensive plan, and you get a lot for the price tag, including access to games on console and PC. However, the price could be overkill if you primarily play on one platform, so here's what to know aboutGame Pass Ultimate. This is the top-tier Game Pass plan, and it offers top-tier features. You get access to over 500 titles in the game library — including EA Play and Day 1 releases — online multiplayer and Xbox Cloud Gaming Beta so you can play on anycompatible device, not just your console or PC. Game Pass Ultimate gives you the most bang for your buck out of these plans. The price is the major hurdle for Game Pass Ultimate, and the price continues to go up. When Game Pass was introduced in2017, there was only one plan and it cost $10 a month. Then in 2019,Microsoft unveiledGame Pass Ultimate with a price of $15 a month, and in2023the company raised the price for the service to $17 a month. And inJuly, the company raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate again to a staggering $20 a month. These price increases  especially over the last two years — are likely a pain point for some gamers. Most gamers will be satisfied with Game Pass Ultimate, although you probably don't need it if you only play on PC or if you mostly play free-to-play online multiplayer games, like Fortnite or Overwatch. The price — and its potential to increase — might send people to other plans. If price is an issue, you can always unsubscribe at any time and resubscribe when a game you want to play is added. Otherwise, this is the plan for you.
